#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The code of conduct for office holders was drawn up by the Government pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, and was published in July 2003.  Deputies will be aware that the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 provides for changes to the ethics framework.   A review of the code will be carried out, in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, after that Bill has been enacted.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The value at which a gift needs to be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission was raised from €650 to €2,000.  If a Minister, Minister of State or another officeholder gets a gift worth more than €2,000 from an organisation or individual, it must be declared to the commission.The Taoiseach stated that the increase was meant to strike a balance between gifts of minimal value and gifts that would be meaningful enough in terms of an ethics requirement.  How can a balance be struck between €650 and €2,000?  It is a substantial increase.  How was the amount of €2,000 decided?  I do not know what kind of gift would be given to a Minister or Minister of State for opening something.  The house of the former Minister, Deputy Woods, is probably full of bits of timber and glass.  I hope none is worth €2,000.  Will the Taoiseach comment?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The purpose of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 is to require officeholders and Oireachtas Members not to accept gifts or loans worth in aggregate more than €2,000 in a calendar year from a friend for personal reasons without obtaining the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission that acceptance would not be likely to materially influence the recipient in the performance of his or her functions or duties.Regarding the question of what threshold for disclosures to the Standards in Public Office Commission should apply, a balance must be struck.  On the one hand, the figure needs to be small enough to be meaningful as an ethics requirement and, on the other, it needs to be large enough so that officeholders and Oireachtas Members do not need to spend time counting every ordinary gift from friends.  It also needs to be large enough to avoid making the Standards in Public Office Commission deal with applications concerning gifts worth less than the set amount.The threshold has not increased since the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, apart from a change to a convenient euro amount during the euro changeover in 2002.  The threshold set in the Act was the first attempt to set thresholds in this area.  It is by no means unreasonable for the first attempt to be revised 13 years later in light of experience, not to mention the need to counterbalance the effects of inflation eroding the true value of the original figure in the intervening years.  In addition, the world in which we live is different from that of 1995.  While €2,000 is not an insignificant amount, it is the opinion that the Bill, when enacted in 2008 or 2009, will set the amount for the coming years.  Increasing the threshold in these circumstances is reasonable.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	It seems as if we held a discussion in this and other forums on the definition of a friend, what loans or gifts friends gave and how they were to be repaid, but this is not the point of my question.  From the information the Taoiseach has with him, does he know how many Ministers or Ministers of State have declared gifts or loans valued above the standard rate of €2,000 in recent years?When the Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance, he refused to allow the Standards in Public Office Commission to initiate an inquiry where it believed sufficient public interest required one.  He made the point that this would not be in the interests of a person who might be investigated.  However, the most important thing would be for that person to be vindicated.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Standards in Public Office Commission is capable of good judgment and that it would only initiate an agreement if such action was warranted?  Does he intend to change that aspect of the legislation?The Standards in Public Office Commission has stated that there is no provision to allow third parties to clear spending on referenda or any other campaigns in advance with it and that no third party did so before the most recent campaign.  The Taoiseach and I are both of the view that this is an important matter.  Is it intended to change the aspect of the legislation relating to this matter?  Persons or organisations which involve themselves in election or referenda campaigns should, under law, be obliged to declare the sources from which income above a certain level is received.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The questions relate to the Standards in Public Office Commission, declarations and ethics.  The public has a right to know, in the context of transparency and accountability, from where those who campaign either for or against the question posed in a referendum or take part in the electoral process obtain their funding.

Legislative changes relating to the Standards in Public Office Commission are, in any event, a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I asked a supplementary question in respect of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  In that context, does the Government intend to amend that legislation in order that organisations or individuals would be required to declare their sources of income?  The situation whereby some groups can obtain funding from unidentified sources for various campaigns should not be allowed to continue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	As the Ceann Comhairle stated, the Deputy's latter question is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The matter will obviously be considered but if the Deputy were to submit a parliamentary question directly to the Minister, he might elicit a more comprehensive reply.On the question relating to thresholds, these are matters of judgment.  When I was Minister for Finance, I consulted the select committees on Members interests of both Houses with regard to the proposals contained in the Bill before its publication last year.  The Seanad committee agreed with the proposals, while the Dáil committee welcomed them and indicated that they would further strengthen the accountability of Members of the Oireachtas.With regard to accepting a proposal from the commission that we might allow inquiries or investigations to be made in the absence of a complaint, the law already enables the Standards in Public Office Commission to carry out investigations on its own initiative.  Such investigations are full-scale in nature and are carried out by the commission itself.  The commission is allowed to appoint an inquiry officer in order to ascertain whether there is evidence to sustain a complaint where it has received one.  The launch of an inquiry by an inquiry officer could have serious and adverse consequences for any person who was the subject of that inquiry.  It is not unreasonable that someone should be obliged to lodge a complaint before that happens.  There are numerous categories of people, including the general public, who might make complaints of this nature against officeholders and public servants who come within the commission's purview.The Deputy inquired about exceptional circumstances.  If the circumstances were so exceptional, then one would expect someone to make a complaint.  In any event, there is no doubt that the Standards in Public Office Commission would come under increasing pressure to appoint inquiry officers in circumstances that are less and less exceptional.  The result would be the holding of inquiries where no one had actually complained but where there could be serious consequences for the persons who were the subject of such inquiries.  That would not be fair.As already stated, the commission has the right to initiate an investigation in the absence of a complaint.  If it wishes to appoint an inquiry officer, this should be done on the basis of a complaint received.  I do not believe the system, which is fair to people on all sides, should be changed.  People act on the basis of complaint and not on their own initiative.  Also, the adverse consequences for the person concerned stand during the course of the process even where a complaint has not been made.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I listened to the Taoiseach's initial reply which is almost word for word the reply he gave to the same question in May.  In essence, he is saying that the Government will carry out a review of the code of conduct for officeholders following enactment of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  The problem with that reply is that the ethics legislation appears to be going nowhere.  The Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 is the product of the grandstanding in October 2006 of the then Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell who obtained a commitment that this legislation would be introduced to ensure an officeholder, who is unsure as to whether he or she should accept a gift, can seek the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission in that regard.  The Bill which was passed by the Seanad in July 2007 is going nowhere as far as this House is concerned.The Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Finance with overall responsibility for this Bill, stated in January 2008 that it was his intention to have the Bill passed by this House that session.  However, that did not happen.  It appears to me the Government has no serious intention of having this legislation enacted.  In those circumstances, will the Taoiseach undertake a review of the code of conduct for officeholders irrespective of the passage of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007?  If, as implied in the Taoiseach's reply, the code of conduct requires to be reviewed will he agree to carry out this review irrespective of the Government's intentions in respect of the amendment of the ethics legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	It is open to the Whips to agree to the taking of the legislation concerned.  There is a great deal of legislation pending this session.  I take Deputy Gilmore's point that it was contemplated the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 would be dealt with during the last session but that this did not happen.  It is unlikely to be completed this session given the necessity to deal with various other pieces of legislation, including the Finance Bill 2008, the nursing homes Bill and Social Welfare Bill.  There is currently a great deal of legislation going through the House and it is unlikely the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 will be taken this session.  Perhaps it can be done but I do not know that.  It is unlikely, in my opinion, it will be completed this session.  It will be possible to deal with it early in the next session.The Government is interested in enacting the legislation.  Also, Deputies will have an opportunity to voice their views on the Bill when it is being debated in the House.  While I cannot predict what issues will arise, in my view it would not make sense to review the code until after the Bill has been enacted.  I believe this is the best way to proceed.  The code of conduct does not stand in isolation.  It cannot impose requirements not already set out in legislation and as such it is legislatively based.  Also, it does not add any new powers or provisions in respect of enforcement and attempts, in the main, to provide guidance at a level of detail that would be difficult to express in legislation.The code of conduct assists Members or officeholders to ensure they are in compliance with the legislation.  Also, it is used by the Standards in Public Office Commission as guidance in terms of whether a complaint made under section 4 of the Act should be investigated.  Section 4 is the section of the ethics legislation under which complaints of a breach of the ethics Acts can be made.  These provisions are not in any way compromised or undermined by the absence of a review of the code of conduct.  The review can only be undertaken following enactment of the legislative base.  As Deputy Gilmore stated, the Bill has been passed by the Seanad and it will be taken in this House as soon as practicable. We can obtain views in the context of that and conduct a review which, however, may not require subsequent changes to the code of conduct.  I make the point that a review of the code of conduct cannot add to the legislative base that already exists.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Taoiseach's earlier reply regarding the request from the Standards in Public Office Commission that it be allowed to carry out inquiries in the absence of a complaint being made to it is akin to saying the Garda should not carry out investigations in respect of normal policing unless somebody has made a specific complaint.  If the commission has responsibility for policing the battery of ethics and standards legislation that now exists and has requested the power to carry out investigations on its own volition, surely it is reasonable to grant it such a power.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I respectfully suggest that in areas of criminal law, gardaí or law enforcement officers do not act except on foot of a complaint from an individual citizen.  In respect of a civil assault, for example, they would not proceed in the absence of other evidence unless they received a complaint.  They would not have the evidential basis on which to proceed.  It is not true to claim, therefore, that people can act under the criminal code in the absence of a complaint.  In many cases, a complaint is required before action can take place.Apart from that, it is a civil law matter relating to ethics requirements either under the ethics legislation or the Electoral Acts.  In regard to issues of ethics, we have established the commission to act on the basis of complaints.  That is eminently reasonable.  I regard the idea that an adverse situation could obtain in respect of a Member of the House in the absence of a complaint as offending the principle of fairness.  If it is the case that the general category of people who can complain have not taken the opportunity to do so, an inappropriate imbalance would be created if an inquiry officer was appointed in the absence of any complaint from anybody.  Even in the absence of an inquiry officer, one can still conduct an investigation on one's own initiative, which itself is a substantive procedure.  The appointment of inquiry officers who can visit Members' offices to state they have been appointed by a commission, however eminent, to inquire into something but who on being asked whether a complaint was made can reply "No" goes beyond what is fair and reasonable, given the adverse circumstances that would as a result obtain for that Member or officeholder even in the absence of evidence and the inquiry going into the sand.  I do not think that is right.

Where are these declarations recorded and retained?I note that the code requires an officeholder to make a declaration where he or she has a specific material interest in respect of any matter pertaining to the performance of his or duties.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether declarations have been made in this regard over the period since 2003 and, again, where this information is retained?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I can inquire.  If it is in line with the legislation and the code of conduct, I will do so.  There are some aspects of the legislation where one submits the inquiry to the commission and the commission confirms one's position.  It is not declarable or whatever if it is covered by the legislation.  I would need to check for the Deputy.  I do not know off-hand.I believe there is also an arrangement by which one can take a gift, which is not declarable, from a friend at a certain threshold if it is passed by the commission, if the Deputy understands what I am saying, and one abides by the finding of the commission.  I am not aware that there has been any such example.  I will check it out to ascertain whether it is possible to give the Deputy that information.I know of a situation where Ministers would declare their interest, for example, in any issue that would come up for discussion and would have informed the Standards in Public Office Commission of it.  That is one of the requirements of the code.  That has happened with Ministers on a few occasions.

I seek a clarification as to where the information is retained.  To whom are the declarations to be made?  Is specific information retained on all aspects under the code of conduct?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The commission would retain any information in that respect.  If one is offered a gift of a certain value, one applies to the commission to clarify whether it is right to accept it and one abides by its decision.  That is the way it works under the provisions of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 that we are discussing.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.Mr. Patrick MacEntee, sole member of the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings 1974, handed over his final report on 12 March 2007.  It was published on 4 April 2007.  The total amount spent on the commission of investigation was €2,632,702.  All costs of the commission of investigation have been discharged.  The breakdown of the €2,632,702 spent on the commission of investigation is as follows: €1,756,533 on legal costs; €351,410 on support staff; and €524,759 on set-up and administrative costs of the offices of the commission.Arising from the passing of the resolution by the House on 10 July last, I understand that the Clerk of the Dáil has communicated the text of the resolution to the British House of Commons together with the report of the commission of inquiry and the Barron reports.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I thank the Taoiseach for that information.  I remind him that on 10 July an all-party motion was passed by the House on the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings which stated that the Dáil:urges the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents held by the British Government relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction and which were inquired into by Judge Barron, for the purposes of assessing said documents with the aim of assisting in the resolution of these crimes;anddirects the Clerk of the Dáil to communicate the text of this Resolution, together with copies of the aforementioned reports, to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with a request that the matter be considered by the House of Commons.Does the Taoiseach know whether this was done?  Did he get any response from the British Government?  If so has he followed up any further with it?  Does the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, have any plans to allow an independent person to access the original documents held by the British Government?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Arising from the motion passed by the Dáil on 10 July last, I understand the Clerk of the Dáil communicated the text of the resolution to the House of Commons, together with the report of the commission of inquiry and the Barron reports.  I am not aware if any correspondence has been received by the Clerk of the Dáil since then, apart from acknowledgement of its receipt.  It is not information that is available in supplementary form to me.  The motion urged the UK Government to allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents etc., as the Leader of the Opposition stated in his supplementary.We will continue to see if anything arises from this.  The Houses made this joint resolution and conveyed it to the Houses of Parliament in Britain as an indication of our continuing concern about the matter.  I am not aware that anything substantive has arisen thereafter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I welcome today's announcement that the DUP and Sinn Féin have agreed on a process to deal with the devolution of policing in Northern Ireland, as it is a welcome advance.  Does the Taoiseach have a view, in being able to get at the truth of the matter, that the British Government should hand up whatever documentation it has in this regard?  I am quite sure it has a very substantial amount.  Does the Taoiseach share my view that this material should be handed to an internationally respected judicial figure, who could access it and deal with it properly so the truth would be known in so far as it can be fully and accurately assessed?  This should happen but clearly I cannot force the British Government to do so.  The Taoiseach is in a different position to talk to the British Prime Minister, so does he have a view on it?The Justice for the Forgotten committee has worked hard on this issue, as the Taoiseach is aware, since the last Oireachtas debate on collusion took place in January this year.  I understand it contacted the Taoiseach's office in writing regarding the progression of this agreed motion and I also understand it has not received a response from the office of the Taoiseach, which is surprising.  I ask the Taoiseach to check this and will he confirm if he has responded to the Justice for the Forgotten committee in regard to the motion?  If so, what has he been able to tell them?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to consider a request for a meeting from Justice for the Forgotten.  I will check the correspondence issue.On the question of seeing if we can get to the truth of the matter, we will support any opportunity to do so.  We will continue our efforts even if we are not satisfied with the response of the British Government to date.  That has been the Government's position and we will continue to do everything we can in that respect.  There is no issue between us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I welcome the Taoiseach's comment that he shares my view that the truth should be got at here if possible.  I urge him on behalf of the Government to raise this at every opportunity with his counterpart, the British Prime Minister.  There are papers possessed by the British Government and I assume some are secret.  All Members of the Dáil would like to bring closure to this and supported the motion.  I urge the Taoiseach to press this case at every opportunity.The events were a long time ago now but still cause hurt to the next of kin of those killed in the atrocities.  It would be only right and appropriate that the Irish Government and Houses of the Oireachtas should have a united and absolutely committed agreement on bringing closure to this dark page in Irish history.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	27	We have the experience of the commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and it is the case that while much was achieved, it did not resolve the issues for relatives.  We also have the work done by the Eames-Bradley group.  Issues have also arisen where legal proceedings have been initiated.  Rather than embark on a judicial inquiry process at this time we have to look to those processes to see what further progress, if any, can be made, given the extensive and resourceful way in which we have sought to help people on those issues to date.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Am I correct in saying the Taoiseach would be familiar with the work of Justice for the Forgotten over many difficult years, not only in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but regarding a list of atrocities that took place along the length of the Border and further down the country?  Justice for the Forgotten has been a key voice on behalf of victims, survivors and the bereaved in all of those instances.Is the Taoiseach aware that funding for Justice for the Forgotten runs out at the end of this year, and that it has no information, as we speak, from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about how much, or any funding will be allocated to it for 2009?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is sitting beside the Taoiseach.  Has the Taoiseach discussed the matter with him and, if not, will he undertake to do so because we must recognise — as the Taoiseach has clearly done in response to Deputy Kenny — that the pursuit of truth and justice in all of these matters is essential?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the work of Justice for the Forgotten in seeking truth and justice, and in assisting the survivors and the bereaved in practical ways, needs to continue?Similarly, can the Taoiseach tell us if arrangements are in place to provide for the long-term medical needs of persons who availed of the Remembrance Commission fund, which was dissolved a little over a fortnight ago, on 31 October?  Will there be a report on the work of the commission and the fund itself?  How many people were assisted over the course of its terms of office, and will there be ongoing assistance for the medical needs of those who have been assisted by the fund during the period of its tenure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I cannot give specific detailed answers on those matters but, as the Deputy indicated, the remit of the Remembrance Commission fund ended on 31 October, having been extended for a number of years.  The commission has done important work in acknowledgement, remembrance and assistance to address the needs of victims.  I thank the members of the commission for all their work over the years on behalf of victims.  The Victims' Commission, under the umbrella of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will now consider applications for funding from bodies and groups acting on behalf of victims.  That is the situation as things stand since the expiry of the previous arrangements on 31 October.

I urge the Taoiseach to address that question please.  Does he not accept that the absence of any clarity as to the Government's commitment for funding in 2009 is leading to quite serious concern among the members of Justice for the Forgotten and those whom they serve so well?  Will the Taoiseach please offer the clarity and assurance that is necessary?Regarding the work of the Remembrance Commission fund, can the Taoiseach clarify again whether a report will be published on its work?  I know the Taoiseach cannot give me all of the detail as to the numbers who have been assisted and about specific ongoing supports in terms of medical needs, but can he undertake to the House to have that information at least provided to the three party leaders in the Opposition who have sponsored these questions today?Noting the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Kenny on his efforts to build on the work of his predecessor in terms of having the British Government co-operate with the pursuit of truth and justice regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974, will he seek to impress on Prime Minister Gordon Brown what I can only describe as the weight of the resolution we passed unanimously on 10 July 2008?  Does the Taoiseach not share my concern that the failure to respond on the part of the British Prime Minister and the Parliament at Westminster to the united appeal of all the elected voices of this House is a cause of major concern to each of us, without exception?  Will the Taoiseach press for the appointment of an independent, international judicial figure who will have access to all the relevant documentation and material under the control of the British Government and all its agencies in order to further the intent of securing the full truth about the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and those other matters reported on by a series of eminent appointees, including Messrs. Justices Hamilton and Barron and Mr. Paddy MacEntee?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As I stated, any organisations or groups that have been involved in this issue to date have been deriving funding for their activities from the Remembrance Commission fund, which expired on 31 October.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider any applications for further funding thereafter.On the Justice for the Forgotten group, there was a response by Government and co-operation by other Members of the House.  There have been commissions of inquiry into these matters.  Some €2.6 million has been expended in the case of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, as mentioned in reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question.  No question arises over resources not being made available to deal with the substantive issue.  They have been provided and the work has been brought as far as possible.  Mr. MacEntee's findings on shortcomings and omissions were a matter of serious concern although it would be acknowledged that he noted considerable improvements in administrative practice since he first examined the issue.  A full review carried out of all systems and procedures in the relevant Departments and agencies will ensure the failures found by Mr. MacEntee do not occur in the future.  Legal issues associated with another aspect of this matter have been dealt with in other parliamentary questions.

Subsequently there was a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas to address the Deputy's concern, requesting that any further help that the British Government could give be given.  This remains the position of the Irish Government and the Oireachtas.  We will continue to determine how this can be advanced.  I do not want to indicate that a solution is imminent because this is not the case as matters stand.  We must and will continue to put our case and indicate the weight of the resolution of the Dáil in respect of this matter.  Unfortunately, issues arise from the conflict that have not been resolved.The latest process is the Eames-Bradley process, which is an effort to try to deal with this in a comprehensive fashion.  That is an ongoing process and we must see where it takes us.  It is a difficult issue, involving the grief and loss of families.  One of the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings was personally known to me.I am also aware of the difficulties that arise for families when this matter is revisited after such a long time.  Failure to find resolution causes its own repeated trauma for the families, along with the frustration and difficulty this engenders.  All of that is an unfortunate consequence of doing the right thing by making further inquiries into these investigations.  Unfortunately, it has not brought finality or closure.  We must continue to work to see if we can do that.  Only finding out the total truth will achieve that and that truth has not emerged in 34 years.

In this case it was communicated by the Clerk of the Dáil.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Responsibility for the development of treatment services for young offenders, where required, in and out of the prison setting, falls to the Irish Youth Justice and Probation Services.  These services come under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but overarching responsibility for the development of appropriate services will lie with the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs as responsibility for youth affairs is being transferred to that office.Action 19 of the national drugs strategy focuses on early intervention with youth where early use of alcohol or drugs comes to the attention of the Garda.  Where this occurs, intervention by the community police and-or the health and social services to address the individual's needs is appropriate.  This action has been progressed through the work of the national drugs strategy team and the drugs task forces at the more local level.  I understand from the Garda that, although considerable informal links are in place involving the statutory and voluntary service providers, there is a need to establish more formal procedures in this regard.  This issue is being followed up by the Health Service Executive in the context of the findings of a report on services for under-18s, produced by that body under action 49 of the national drugs strategy.  This measure focuses on the development and implementation of guidelines for treatment for under-18s.  Guidelines are now in place and progress on their implementation has been made in some areas, but I understand they have yet to be implemented nationwide.Under the national youth justice strategy 2008-10, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs is seeking to develop a number of pilot projects aimed at early identification and greater targeting of young people at risk of offending.  That office is focused on developing earlier-stage case management through appropriate conferencing, in partnership with the Irish Youth Justice Service, the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board and An Garda Síochána.  It is intended that appropriate treatment services will be made available in cases where substance misuse is a factor contributing to the problems involved.Under the Children's Act 2001, the young person's probation section, a division of the probation service, works with under-18s who come before the courts.  The Act recognises that there is no single way of successfully dealing with the problems associated with youth offending and sees detention as the least favoured option.  Therefore, it has shifted the emphasis away from residential-custodial care to care in the community.  Under the Act, the young person's probation section utilises a number of graduated approaches across family conferences, community-based sanctions, parental supervision orders, probation reports, deferment of detention, detention and supervision, supervision after detention and voluntary aftercare to deal with offenders.  Where substance misuse is a factor, appropriate treatment is made available, up to and including residential rehabilitation.In the prison context, the Irish Prison Service drugs policy and strategy, Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons, includes a commitment to provide drug treatment options for those who need them.  Progress is being made towards fulfilling that commitment, including the contracting of Merchants Quay Ireland, a voluntary sector organisation, to provide counselling services.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is in the process of developing a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009-16.  The new strategy will continue to include measures aimed at trying to prevent young people from becoming involved with drugs, as well as treatment measures aimed at helping those who do develop problems.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Harristown House, which cost €450,000 to run last year, treats up to 100 residents per annum and has a 65% success rate, in other words, two thirds of residents do not reoffend and stay sober.  The facility has been operating for ten years and employs 20 staff.  Did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform contact the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and, if so, did he explain the reason for the decision to close down this valuable facility?As the Minister of State will be aware, according to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it costs €100,000 per annum to keep a young offender in prison, whereas Harristown House operated at an overall cost of €450,000 per annum.  A number of reports have been published on this issue, including one entitled, Treating Addiction, Tackling Crime, which provided an excellent evaluation of Harristown House.  Given that all the stakeholders, including the probation and welfare service and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, were satisfied with the facility, why was it necessary to close it down?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I appreciate that this is a matter of serious concern to Deputy Ring and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, both of whom have raised it with me previously.  To give the Deputy a straight answer, I was not aware in advance of the decision on Harristown House and, as I stated publicly, I was not contacted on the issue.  While this concerned me somewhat, I do not want to rehearse a row other than to note that I have responsibility for the national drugs strategy on which the Government takes a partnership approach.  As one of the key players, alongside the probation and welfare service and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I was not informed in advance of the decision to close the facility.However, having said that, the decision was taken following a review of adult probation residential facilities carried out in 2007.  It was not a random decision but the outcome of a process.  Following the review, a number of recommendations and options emerged.  The board of management, at its meeting of 25 September, made a recommendation to proceed with what was specifically referred to as Option Two.  This was as follows:Close down the facility, take time to reflect on the learning and develop a vision and a plan for a new way forward for Harristown House.  There are HR and financial implications in doing this.  Developing a clear vision for the future will require a precise set of steps and processes with a view to re-opening a new facility under the management of a competent strategic partner that is client centred, evidence based, effectively and efficiently managed and value for money.  The benefit of this option is that Harristown House would be retained as a facility and transformed through learning, reflection and strategic planning into a superior service with clear vision and focus.The closure arose as a result of a review of adult probation residential facilities carried out in 2007.  The board of management of Harristown House chose an option involving the closure of the facility.  However, the second aspect of this course of action was to proceed with closure with a view to having a new facility at Harristown.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I and other Deputies from the west, including the Minister of State's party colleagues from County Roscommon and elsewhere, are concerned about the decision to close Harristown House.  Of the 100 people treated in the facility last year, 65% did not reoffend.  What will happen to the young people the centre treats?  Will they become involved in crime or addicted to drugs again?  How do the Minister of State and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform plan to deal with these people?It is wrong to close down this facility without proper consideration.  Irrespective of the decision of the board of management, the problems in the facility should have been resolved before the decision had to be made.  Young people in the west will be back on the streets, taking drugs and reoffending.  What will happen to their educational needs?  Some of those treated in Harristown House could not read or write.  What action will be taken to re-open the centre?

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I launched bulletin 4 of the all-Ireland drug prevalence survey, focusing on cocaine, on behalf of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs last month and I am fully aware of its findings.  This bulletin gives an in-depth analysis of cocaine use in the country and helps to deepen our understanding of such use.While the findings that 5.3% of all adults aged 15 to 64 years and 8.2% of those aged 15 to 34 years had used cocaine are serious, it must be borne in mind that these figures are for lifetime use and therefore include many people who have only tried cocaine once or twice.  Of more significant importance are the findings in respect of recent and current use, that is, those who had taken cocaine in the past year and past month.  The figures for these two groups are 1.7% and 0.5% of the overall population, respectively.  The corresponding figures for younger adults aged 15 to 34 years indicate that cocaine use is predominantly a younger adult phenomenon.While the proportion of the population using cocaine on a regular basis is relatively small, there are clearly concerns about the health consequences for the people who are taking the drug and the criminal activity generated around the supply of cocaine and other drugs.  At the same time, it is important to note that some findings of the survey are encouraging, particularly the numbers stopping their use of the drug and the increased recognition of the risks involved in taking cocaine.  The percentage of those users who had stopped using cocaine increased from 62% in 2002-03 to 82% of all adults and 78% of those aged 15 to 34 years in 2006-07.  In this regard "health reasons" was given as the most common cause for stopping.  I hope this indicates that drugs awareness messages are beginning to hit home.Tackling cocaine use is a priority for the Government and the implementation of the recommendations of the joint National Advisory Committee on Drugs-national drugs strategy team report, An Overview of Cocaine Use in Ireland, published in 2007, is an important part of the overall approach.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The report recognised the need, over the medium term, for a re-orientation of drug services from drug specific interventions to treatment tailored towards the individual, regardless of the drugs he or she uses.  This is increasingly necessary given the widespread instances of polydrug use now occurring.  International evidence also suggests that treatment, primarily in the form of counselling, works with cocaine users.  I am aware that the HSE is in the process of re-engineering its services to this end.As regards direct interventions, this year I have made additional funding of €1.2 million available for 17 cocaine initiatives through the drug task forces.  These will support the development of new responses to cocaine misuse, strengthen and develop existing cocaine specific projects in drug task force areas and support other projects aimed at tackling polydrug and cocaine use.  Of these projects, 12 are located in local drug task force areas in Dublin, with the others in Ennis, Drogheda, Mallow and Ballyragget.  This reflects the fact, as the survey indicates, that prevalence rates tend to be higher in the east, spanning an area extending roughly from County Louth to County Cork.  The final project involves the training of frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues, building on the work already being done by the HSE, both with its own staff and with those in the community and voluntary sectors who are dealing with the cocaine problem.These allocations add to six cocaine specific projects in  local drug task force areas which are already funded under the emerging needs fund.  Furthermore, the fund supports nine other projects aimed at polydrug and cocaine use.  I am satisfied the resources being provided will make a real impact on the cocaine problem.Meanwhile, the Garda and customs service of the Revenue Commissioners continue to target the criminals involved in the illicit drugs trade.  In this regard, I applaud their excellent work and that of the Irish Naval Service in seizing a substantial quantity of cocaine off the Cork coast last week.In the area of prevention, the Health Service Executive launched a national awareness campaign in February of this year, focusing on the dangers of cocaine use.  This campaign is being augmented by local campaigns on the cocaine theme organised by drug task forces, for which I have provided funding of €500,000.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is in the process of developing a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009 to 2016.  The data on cocaine in the drug prevalence survey is timely in that regard and will help to inform the work on the formulation of a new strategy which I hope to publish in the coming months.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The two key words associated with drug use are "supply" and "demand".  As regards the former, the Garda, Army and Naval Service are to be complimented on their detection successes which have put drug barons under pressure.  However, the Government's failure to decrease the level of demand for drugs is unacceptable and requires urgent action.  I recall Deputies lauding the efforts of the Irish Examiner for highlighting the problem of drug use.  The Government did not follow up on the newspaper’s endeavours.What will the Minister of State do to try to provide alternatives to drug use?  His senior Minister admitted to me on a previous occasion that we must try to find alternatives to drug use.  I am not aware of any action by the Department or the Minster of State, who I accept was appointed to office only recently, to provide alternatives.In February 2008, a national public awareness campaign was launched entitled, The Party's Over.  The figures before us do not suggest the party is over.  The Minister of State must take action.  What does he propose to do?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	47	We do not view cocaine in isolation as it is associated with polydrug use with the result that people do not tend to have only a cocaine problem.  The way to address the problem is through the national drug strategy, which has a number of key elements, including tackling the supply side, an issue to which the Deputy alluded.  Another key element is prevention, education and awareness and our efforts in this area will continue.It is interesting to note that while the report we are discussing indicated that cocaine use has increased in the age profile, this phenomenon is visible in most developed countries as they become affluent.It was also very telling and worthwhile to note that those who had tried and used cocaine had given it up.  That figure had also increased.  The evidence for this is that they had given it up for health reasons.  From that viewpoint, the campaigns in terms of education and awareness are working because people who are experimenting tend to stop using the drug.It is important when looking at the prevalence figures not to over-concentrate on the life-time use because that includes anyone who might have used the drug once, but rather on the shorter period, such as usage in the last month or last year.  Where those figures are smaller around the country, it is acknowledged that those who have used it have reduced significantly and are giving up the drug.  The main reason for this is health issues and that would indicate that some of the programmes, policies, education and awareness campaigns are beginning to take effect, as indicated when the 2002-03 survey is compared to that for 2006-07.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Is the Minister of State not worried by the statement that the most prevalent access to the drug is through family members?  If he says that health considerations are the most common reason for people giving up cocaine usage, is it not amazing that the most prevalent way of it moving on is through family members?  Some 25% of people now know — as compared to 2003 when only 14% knew — of people who take cocaine.  It has become a dominant factor in society because families are moving it along.  Again, I ask what is being done in regard to that aspect.The National Road Safety Authority has signage and other advertising, etc., but we do not seem to be doing that or following the NRSA's example in terms of reducing deaths on roads.

A joint statement on behalf of the Departments was issued on 4 April 2005 regarding the findings of the investigators' report, including actions to be taken arising from it.As the Departments' statement is too long to read out in the time available to me to answer a priority question, I have arranged for a copy to be made available to the Deputy.  The key point is that a substantial number of allegations were made and these were thoroughly investigated.  The outcome of the investigations, as clearly stated in the Departments' statement at the time, is that the bulk of allegations made by the complainant were not upheld.  The investigators made a single recommendation to the effect that an independent review of the practices and policies relating to bullying in the organisation should be carried out.  In addition, the Departments agreed that two further actions arising from the report of the investigators should be implemented.  First, that an arrangement be made for further courses in relation to bullying for all members of staff, including the CEO, building on the considerable work that had been carried out in the organisation, under the personal direction of the CEO and, second, that an open and transparent policy on recruitment and promotion be followed in all future appointments and promotions.All of the actions were delivered by the CEO to the satisfaction of the two Departments.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	In light of the Minister's response one might believe nothing is wrong in Waterways Ireland.  In the event, why did a tribunal award €70,000 in one case and €50,000 in another?  How much more had to be paid in response to allegations in Waterways Ireland?In his reply the Minister said recommendations had been made regarding recruitment and bullying.  One of the recommendations made on bullying was that all staff, including the CEO, would have to take a course dealing with the issue.  Did the CEO take such a course and if so, has the Minister taken any action, as it is already costing taxpayers both North and South, €120,000 plus legal fees?  There is great concern in the North with regard to employing people and on the aspect of bullying.  Those involved are not happy with the replies they are getting from either the Minister or his Department in this regard.  They believe a proper investigation has not been put in place.

It is joint action in all respects because that is the way the body is set up.  My information is that the actions agreed to were delivered by the CEO to the satisfaction of the Departments.The Deputy has raised a question regarding subsequent legal actions.  Following legal advice on issues raised by the complainant, in the aftermath of the investigations, the Departments concluded and informed him that there was no need for formal disciplinary action against the CEO.  They could see no grounds on which they should take action on further allegations made by the complainant, given the reality that the bulk of his previous assertions had been thoroughly and independently investigated and not upheld.  The complainant subsequently took a claim to an industrial tribunal in Northern Ireland to the effect that he had been victimised by Waterways Ireland.  A compromise agreement was reached in September 2007 that Waterways Ireland would pay €50,000 without admission of liability.  The legal advice to Waterways Ireland was that this was a good result because the complainant's legal fees probably exceeded that amount.  The complainant continues to have a case pending before the High Court in Belfast.

With regard to the person who is creating the problem, why is he in the position he holds?  He is being rewarded with bonuses, and a job, and yet it has so far cost the taxpayers of this country €120,000, with a case pending in the High Court in Belfast.In the North there are standards.  I want to know why action is not being taken against the CEO, as there is a problem.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Government has been, and remains, firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in our society.  This is evidenced by the fact that between 2003 and 2008, there was a doubling of funding targeted at community-based initiatives, through my Department's Vote, from €31.5 million to over €64 million.The reduction in the 2009 funding allocation to the Department for the drugs initiatives must, therefore, be viewed in that context.  In 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the local and regional drugs task force areas, including funding for new cocaine and rehabilitation measures introduced during the year, amounts to nearly €34.8 million.  While the funding available for 2009 has not yet been finalised, I expect the comparable figure for next year to be approximately €34.4 million, a relatively small reduction.In this context, the Deputy should note that of the foregoing, funding for projects in the drug task forces' action plans in 2009, which make up the bulk of the funding in my Department, will be maintained at 2008 levels, that is, €32 million.  Once the funding for next year is finalised, it will be a matter for the drugs task forces, in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team and my Department, to identify measures to enable them to work within their allocated budgets.The drugs strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Departments and agencies and the Department's allocation is only part of a much bigger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2006, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was approximately €220 million.  My Department is currently updating this figure for 2007.  Other savings have been made in the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, which as the Deputy may be aware is being transferred to the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his officials will provide every assistance to groups as they make adjustments to their operations to allow for savings next year.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The bulk of the remainder of my Department's allocation under the drugs strategy funds the work for the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NDST, the Family Support Network and Citywide, all of which will have to identify some savings in 2009.  My officials are working to identify those at present.Finally, the Deputy should note that we are making every effort to ensure the daily frontline services provided across my Department's programmes and schemes are protected as much as possible.  We will continue to liaise with the task forces, other relevant agencies and the NDST over the coming months and will provide every assistance possible to ensure the continued operation of vital services in disadvantaged areas.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I thank the Minister of State for his answer.  However I am still not clear on the details; neither, it appears, is the Minister.  I tabled this question because a large number of groups contact me on a daily basis and want to find out what the budget will be, what services will remain and what services will be going.  The Minister of State made a statement on the day of the budget in his address on frontline services and said, "It is my objective to ensure funding goes directly to frontline services" and then went on to say his Department will not support new contracts to provide support services and community development projects.I met a group of community outreach workers recently who were convincing in telling me their projects will have reduced numbers of outreach workers.  They have been told they must cut back on their budgets and use their budget accordingly, and I can understand that as there are problems with money.  This is a service that is very important for young people and communities.  The Minister of State spoke previously on RAPID areas and there is a huge problem with services being cut.Last Thursday I spoke to a project worker in my area who told me they sought another outreach worker and were told there was no chance in the world they would get one, either this year, next year or the year after.  That is a failure of the Government to provide services that should be on the ground, particularly in communities that need them.  It is fine for the Minister of State to stand up and say there is a 5% cut in current spending.  I realise there have to be cuts across the board, but this is vital area in any community.  Drugs are one of the most lethal weapons in today's society for young people, and in every parish, community and home the issue is spoken about on a daily basis.  One only has to pick up a newspaper to see the coverage.If there is to be a 5% cut it should be channelled in a certain area, and perhaps should be considered in the Minister of State's Department and not in the community where it would make a huge difference to many people.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I welcome the opportunity to clarify the answer.  Deputy Byrne quoted from budget day when I said, "my emphasis is to maintain frontline services".  It is true that funding for the drugs subhead in the Department has been cut by 5%, but the drugs taskforces, which deliver the community-based projects the Deputy mentioned, will receive precisely the same amount of money in 2009 as they did in 2008 despite the 5% cut.Deputy Byrne may argue this does not allow for the expansion of services, and I will concede that, but my hope is that those running the drugs taskforces and engaging with them will be able to deliver the same outcomes next year as they did this year for the same amount of money.  I do not believe it should be impossible for any organisation to find internal savings; it is no different from my own Department.  The reality is that the internal savings they are asked to make is based on receiving the same allocation in 2009 as in 2008.  The challenge for local or regional taskforces is to ensure they can deliver the same level of service.They are not facing a 5% cut.  The budget for the drugs issue is cut by 5%, but the taskforces which fund community-based projects Deputy Byrne mentioned will have no cut next year.  They are receiving precisely the same figure as 2008.  It does not allow for expansion but it focuses our efforts on delivering what the Deputy has asked for, which is frontline services.  There is no cut there and that needs to be re-emphasised.

Chun dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin seo, níl de rogha ag an Rialtas ach srianta a chur le caiteachas trasna na earnála Stáit ar fad agus féachaint chuige go bhfuil an luach is fearr agus is féidir á fháil as an gcaiteachas sin.Tá soláthar iomlán de €37.129 milliún curtha ar fáil d'Údarás na Gaeltachta sna Meastacháin do 2009.  Cé gur laghdú de thuairim is 8% é seo i gcomparáid le Meastacháin 2008, creidimse nach gciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh ciorrú substaintiúil á dhéanamh ar ghníomhaíochtaí an Údaráis i dtaca le leas phobal na Gaeltachta.Ar an chéad dul síos, tá suim bhreise de €2 milliún á chur ar fáil ag mo Roinn don Údarás i mbliana chun cabhrú leis an chlár caipitil atá idir lámha a chur chun cinn.  Ar an dara dul síos, beidh sé de dhualgas ar an Údarás, mar aon le gach eagraíocht Stáit eile i gcomhthéacs na gcúinsí airgeadais atá tagtha chun cinn, grinnscrúdú a dhéanamh ar réimsí caiteachais uile na heagraíochta, an réimse riaracháin ach go háirithe, chun féachaint chuige go bhfuiltear ag feidhmiú ar bhealach atá lán-éifeachtach agus tairbheach.  Sa chomhthéacs seo agus ag éirí as cruinnithe a bhí agam le gairid leis an gcathaoirleach, leis an bpríomhfheidhmeannach agus le toscaireacht ón mbord, tá mise dóchasach go mbeidh an tÚdarás in ann feidhmiú laistigh dá bhuiséad trí straitéisí nuálacha a chur i gcrích agus tríd úsáid éifeachtach a bhaint as acmhainní agus cláracha Stáit éagsúla atá ar fáil.Ar ndóigh, ní mór féachaint ar chomhthéacs níos leithne ná an tÚdarás féin chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le caiteachas an Stáit ar an nGaeltacht.  Chomh maith leis an soláthair sa bhreis ar €37 milliún atá ar fáil don Údarás i 2009, tá €54 milliún eile beagnach le caitheamh trí Vóta mo Roinnse ar scéimeanna éagsúla sa Ghaeltacht agus ar na hoileáin, a bhfuil formhór an daonra a chónaíonn orthu sa Ghaeltacht.  Meabhraím don Teachta freisin go bhfuil €17.3 milliún agus €4.6 milliún ceadaithe faoin gclár nua forbartha tuaithe do Mheitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta agus do Chomhar na nOileán faoi seach don tréimhse cúig bliana amach romhainn.

Nor have I engaged with the Ministers for Health and Children or Justice Equality and Law Reform to explore the possibility of introducing legal restrictions on the sale of its principal ingredients, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and I currently have no plans in that regard.  As the Deputy may be aware, these substances are used legally in the production of a range of products, including cold remedies and dietary supplements.The danger of drug precursors — legal substances which can be used in combination to manufacture illicit drugs — is monitored under UN international controls.  Ireland is a party to the 1988 United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances which lays down requirements with respect to the monitoring of the licit use of precursors.  This allows the International Narcotics Control Board, INCB, in tandem with the countries involved, to monitor the illicit use of these substances.  With respect to the illicit manufacture and abuse of methamphetamine in Europe, the 2007 INCB report indicates that this is only a problem in a limited number of countries in western and central Europe, mainly in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Germany.Meanwhile, the draft EU drugs action plan 2009-12, which is nearing finalisation, includes a number of actions focusing on the diversion and trafficking in, or via Europe, of drug precursors used in the manufacture of illicit drugs.  These proposals are being supported by Ireland, whose contribution to the process is being co-ordinated by my Department.The new drugs strategy will include measures to deal with issues arising from the use of any illicit drug, including crystal meths.  The issue of the control of drug precursors has been discussed in that regard and it is likely to feature under an action under the new strategy.  Overall, the emphasis in the strategy will be on ensuring that there is an ongoing comprehensive response to drug-related problems, rather than on drug-specific measures per se.

Is he aware the UN office on drugs and crime has said the sudden growth of the drug in the United States and its expansion from being a regional to a national problem there could be replicated in Europe?  Is he aware that the number of European countries reporting seizures has more than doubled, from 11 in 2000 to 25 in 2005?  Is he aware crystal meths is available in some of Ireland's cities and towns, that there have been consistent seizures of the drug since 2004 and that while the quantities seized have been small, they have been increasing?  In July 2008 six kilos of the drug were seized in County Offaly.

There were two seizures, the one the Deputy mentioned in the midlands, which was considered a major seizure, and a second seizure in the south of the country.  Crystal meths must be dealt with as one of the illegal substances with which we deal.  There will be an action, under the new national drugs strategy, to deal with the issue of precursors.It is important that the actions we take to try to deal with the situation are taken on a European wide basis, rather than having a different strategy here to what the rest of Europe might have.  The 2009-12 EU drugs action plan will be supported by this country so that we have a co-ordinated, rather than an individual, response.

Has it any side effects if used in a mixture or with other substances, such as those we see with cocaine and alcohol, which produces cocaethylene which can cause heart failure?

Therefore, it is a serious concern.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, it is regarded in the US as one of the more common hard core drugs.  With regard to its effects, it is seen as a euphoric sex and dance culture drug, but has significant adverse consequences.  It can lead to paranoia, kidney failure, violence, internal bleeding and less inhibited sexual behaviour.  There are also risks attached to injecting and so forth.  While a number of cases have come forward for treatment here, and there is anecdotal evidence of some cases, the use of drug is still low and hopefully will remain low.  There have only been two significant seizures, one in the south and the six kilos in the midlands.  There are many more drugs that are far more prevalent here and crystal meths is only showing on the horizon.  However, the side effects are very serious and the treatment is very difficult and problematic.

While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.It was against this background, therefore, that in May 2007 I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis, to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities, community, sporting and social, that take place in their areas.  Seven groups are currently delivering the pilot evening transport service.A review of the pilot scheme is about to get under way and it is anticipated this will be completed in January 2009.  In the interim, funding will be provided, pending the outcome of the review and my response to recommendations arising.

I would prefer if the Minister had the review sooner, because it is important the scheme continues and is rolled out on a national basis.  I hope the Minister continues to provide funding for the scheme.  He has said he will provide it between now and the time the review is completed.What plans has the Minister to roll out the scheme nationally?  He said that in some rural areas hackneys and taxis are available, but in others they are not.  It is important for rural people to have some kind of service to bring them to sporting events, bingo or wherever they need to go.  The Minister should not take any notice of begrudgers who give out about funding.Last week I tabled a question to ascertain the funding available for Dublin Bus and the Luas and there is much State intervention to provide funding for Dublin.  However, as soon as rural Ireland is mentioned, a row breaks out and people become upset and uptight.  Will the Minister continue this initiative on a national basis throughout the country?  What priorities does he have in this regard?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Deputy should join Members on this side of the House as he is aware of my views on these issues.  I have replied many times to criticism of providing rural services to the effect that attempts to provide services in rural Ireland always appear to be dear, while the cost of equivalent services provided in more urbanised locations never seems to be an issue.  However, the seven pilots are in operation and an evaluation will be conducted.  In this regard, one should try to ascertain how such projects can be as economically self-sustaining as possible.Some interesting statistics have emerged thus far.  From May 2007 to December 2007, 1,475 services carried a total of 13,000 passengers, of whom 64% were holders of free travel passes.  This year, up to May 2008, 812 services have carried 6,072 passengers, of whom 66% held free travel passes.  I had hoped that many people who did not hold free travel passes but who wanted to go out at night would avail of the services.  Perhaps such people sought the freedom to have a drink or two or whatever or in other words, to do what people do in cities.  The higher the ratio of paying to non-paying customers, the more sustainable are the services.  In the review, I have asked that possibilities to increase income should be considered to facilitate spreading the service wider without a great increase in cost.There is no point in me standing up in the House today and pretending I have a huge pot of gold as I do not.  I know the contents of my Estimate and no doubt the Deputy has also studied it.  However, this is a good service and it is worth reviewing it.  The review will be rapid and I seek practical answers to ascertain how the money can be stretched further, if not nationally.  Are there ways in which to increase the schemes' income in order that they are more self-financing and the service may be stretched further than at present?  Obviously my response is only qualitative as the really accurate response will emerge from the review.  However, the feedback I hear on the ground appears to be favourable.  I do not know whether the Deputy has heard otherwise.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	80	As the scheme now is a pilot project that appears to be working, the Minister should not over-regulate it.  The pilot scheme is working and other areas seek it.  However, the Minister should avoid doing what every Department does to working schemes, that is, they poison it through over-regulation.  The Minister should avoid doing so.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Yes.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	83	——for people who did not have free travel passes.  Those with free travel passes travel free.  My thinking was the more I could encourage rural communities to charge a reasonable fare, the more likely that it would be possible to offer a wider range of services.  My experience of rural Ireland was that ordinary people with jobs who wish to go out for the night would not complain about paying a reasonable fare, any more than would someone paying for a taxi in Dublin.  Consequently, I believe a fare of €5 each way was set, which is not unreasonable.  If one hired a taxi in this city, €5 would not get one very far.  The only measure I have been pushing is that the schemes should try to be as commercial as possible and that the gaps I must fill should be as narrow as possible.  The purpose is to extend the service more widely, rather than to save money.  Aside from that, I agree with the Deputy's point.  Creativity and flexibility are the names of the game.  For a service that is designed to each local community's need, to give the best value for money and the best services to the community, the light touch is by far the best and I agree with the Deputy in this regard.

I am delighted to find I was wrong.  Are all the schemes in the west of Ireland or do some operate in Leinster?  As for further development of the scheme and, as Deputy Ring has suggested, its roll-out, what mechanism can be used in this regard?  Will the new Leader groups be able to do this?  Agritourism, which now is an essential part of rural life as a means of developing alternatives for the farming community, probably would benefit from such a roll-out.  What plans does the Minister have to roll it out?  What groups will be able to put forward proposals in this regard?

I insisted on a small proportion of the money going on administration and this was laid down.  The operators could not spend much on administration.  As for the groups involved, West Cork Rural Transport is in Munster, as is Avondhu Development Group in east County Cork.  As Meath Accessible-Kilnaleck Community operates in counties Cavan and Meath, it is half in Leinster and half in Ulster.  The County Sligo Leader Partnership operates in north Connacht, as does Tumna Shannon Development Company, County Roscommon.  Síob Teoranta operates in County Donegal and Laois TRIP in western County Laois.  Consequently, there are one and a half operators in Leinster, one and a half in Ulster, two in Connacht and two in Munster.  Unfortunately for me, none was in County Galway.  They simply did not win the bid.

The point is to keep it attached to some existing structures, either the Leader partnership companies or, more probably, the existing rural transport groups.  Perhaps in time they should realign themselves because the overheads should be kept down.  There are many ways to deliver this service.  Some operators do so with buses on a fixed route.  Another option I thought of was to have a hackney driver, who would be contracted to be on call between certain hours within a ten-mile radius and to bring anyone to and from a place within that radius.  There are many variations on this and as I noted to Deputy Ring, we need flexibility.  It certainly fills a gap and my argument from the outset has been to ask whether it is possible to imagine a city without transport after 8 p.m. and to ask what that would do to social life in cities.  The big question is why should the countryside be different.  We have proved there is a demand for this.

I refer in particular to the potential to attract young people at night and hopefully prevent fatal car crashes such as those seen in recent years.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Absolutely.  One must consider an appropriate pricing mechanism.  Young people spend quite a lot of money when they go out for a night.  If charging them €15 for a safe way of getting to and from places means that one can provide more services, that is fair enough.  Many parents would be more than willing to pay out such sums to ensure their children came and went from discos or wherever they were bound.  Even before I set up this scheme, there were certain areas in which people provided what were commonly termed "disco buses".  It was a great relief for the parents of those areas, because they knew the driver was a responsible adult, as opposed to people getting lifts home at night from people who might have been tempted to drive a little too fast.  All Members are familiar with the related carnage.All possibilities must be examined and I note there is a lot of interest in the House in this regard.  I am open to the idea, when I receive the report, of attending the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to have a discussion on this subject in order that Members collectively can put their minds together, to maximise, within the financial envelopes available to me, the possible impact of the scheme.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	90	As I outlined earlier today, the Government is firmly committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse in our society.  The doubling of funding targeted at community-based initiatives funded through my Department's Vote, from €31.5 million in 2003 to more than €64 million in 2008, is, I believe, clear evidence of that commitment.The reduction in the 2009 funding allocation to my Department for the drugs initiatives must, therefore, be viewed in that context.  This year, the budget for community-based initiatives in the local and regional drugs task force areas, including funding for new cocaine and rehabilitation measures introduced during the year, will come to nearly €34.8 million.  While the funding available for 2009 has not yet been finalised, I expect the comparable figure to be approximately €34.4 million, a relatively small reduction.  It is important to note that funding for projects in drug task forces' action plans in 2009, which comprise the bulk of the funding in my Department, will be maintained at 2008 levels, that is, €32 million.The drugs strategy is based on a co-ordinated effort across many Departments and Government agencies and the Department's allocation is only part of a much larger investment programme in drugs services by these other bodies.  In 2006, it was estimated that expenditure on drugs programmes across all the bodies was approximately €220 million.  This figure is being updated by my Department for 2007.As the Deputy may be aware, responsibility for the management and operation of the young people's facilities and services fund is in the process of being transferred to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, OMYCA.  In this context, more than €20 million in capital and current funding is transferring from my Department's Vote to the OMCYA.  I am confident that the OMYCA will assist groups in every way it can as they make adjustments to their operations to allow for savings next year.The bulk of the remainder of my Department's allocation under the drugs strategy funds the work of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the national drugs strategy team, the Family Support Network and CityWide, all of which must identify some savings in 2009.  My officials are working to identify those at present.I assure the Deputy that my Department is making every effort to ensure that the daily front line services provided across all of the programmes and schemes it operates are protected as much as possible.  On the drugs side, we will continue to liaise with the task forces, other relevant agencies and the national drugs strategy team over the coming months to ensure the continued operation of vital services in disadvantaged areas most affected by drug misuse.

Since then, there has been an explosion in the availability of illegal drugs, some of which have been mentioned and others that are emerging, such as crack cocaine — its usage has increased by 500% in Crumlin — crystal meth and cocaine.Is the Minister of State aware that the increase in the prevalence and use of illegal drugs during the lifetime of the national drugs strategy is evidence that it was under-funded and that the recent reduction will ensure that the next strategy will be even more under-funded?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I disagree that we referred to 2003 except to show the increase over a five year period.  I will be specific because the Deputy mentioned drugs task forces and funding cuts.  As the Deputy is well aware, there is a recession in this country, Britain, the eurozone, the US and Japan.  Consequently, the funding available to my Department is less this year than it was last year.  Bearing this in mind, I stand over my commitment, although many do not wish to recognise it.  I committed to maintain and protect front line services.  While there is a reduction of 5% in the subhead in my Vote, the drugs task forces will receive the same level of funding in 2009 as they did in 2008.  At a time when most Departments and bodies are facing cuts, this is a significant aim.The drugs task forces must work together, examine new methods, achieve greater efficiencies and consider sharing services, be they outreach workers or project counsellors, to ensure that their programmes maximise outcomes for the communities we serve.  However, it is not true to say that task forces will get less money next year than they got this year.  They will get precisely the same funding in 2009 as they got in 2008 and they have been so informed.

Despite my Department and this subhead experiencing a 5% cut, front line services provided by the task forces will receive €32 million in 2009.  The appeal is to consider new ways in which to do business.  Instead of asking for more money to deliver the same services, the commercial principles that apply in the private sector should be used to determine how to do business and achieve better outcomes for the same money.  This is a challenge, but stating that there will be cuts is factually incorrect.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	100	It is six weeks since the guarantee given by the Government and approved by the House and 10,000 jobs are being lost around the country per month, the vast majority in the private sector.  The small business sector, which comprises businesses that employ low numbers — three, five, ten or 20 — is in crisis because it is unable to get credit.  Banks have called in overdrafts, credit lines have been tightened and machinery is being seized.  Business cannot operate in such circumstances and many people believe that they cannot go on.Unless the Government acts to allow credit lines to flow through the financial systems and business to be conducted, the sector is facing a jobs decimation over the next six months.  I am not the only person discussing the protection of thousands of jobs in small businesses.  The Small Firms Association has rightly pointed out that, unless the Government acts, there will shortly be a jobs implosion.  What are the Government's proposals to recapitalise the banking system so that thousands of jobs can be protected in the near future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Six weeks ago, we decided on a guarantee scheme to provide improved liquidity in the banking system because we wanted to ensure that sufficient lines of credit would be available to small, medium and large businesses.  Were the decision not taken, we would be facing a difficult situation.  The situation continues to be difficult.As a result of the scheme's agreement in the House, business plans and capital ratios are being investigated and the question of liquidity in the banking system is being examined at the behest of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  This work is at an advanced stage and reports to the Minister are imminent.  It is important that we act on up-to-date and accurate information.  I want to make it clear that the Government stands ready to make decisions that are in the interests of the economy and business and to consider all options, not just a specific option.  Much of the information involved is commercially sensitive and it is important, therefore, for the House to realise that the work which is ongoing and which is being advanced will be considered by the Minister for Finance, in the first instance, and the Government in the coming days.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Since the Taoiseach entered office, the process of government has been characterised by indecision.  An economic lifeline is required for small businesses.  There is no point giving a blood transfusion when the patient has died or in providing capital flows through the banking system after businesses have closed.  Some 10,000 people are joining the dole queues each month.  I travelled throughout the country in the past two weeks and discovered that small businesses everywhere are in crisis.  These businesses cannot obtain credit and their overdrafts are being called in.  They will be obliged to shut up shop early in the new year.This is a crisis and if the Government does not act quickly, thousands of jobs will be lost.  This matter is not about the banks, it is about their customers and the protection of Irish jobs in Irish firms.  The Government has ignored all the warning signs, from the events of the property boom through to the adverse financial indicators.  We have reached the stage where people will be obliged to pass the keys of their houses back to the banks in the new year if the Government does not act.  The Government must find a formula in respect of recapitalising the financial system in order that credit might flow through it and that business might be conducted.People in every county are approaching Deputies from the Taoiseach's party, my party and other parties and stating that they cannot continue as they are doing at present because the position is too tight.  Banks cannot lend on a long-term basis unless they can secure capital on the same basis.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a need for recapitalisation, that there is a need to have credit lines flowing through the banking system and that thousands of jobs in the small business sector are on the line and will be lost unless the Government takes action?What is the Taoiseach's plan with regard to recapitalising the banking system so that small businesses might survive and remain in operation and in order that jobs might be protected?  It is about those jobs that I am concerned.  I would like those involved in small businesses throughout the country to hear the Taoiseach's response with regard to what the Government intends to do to save the jobs to which I refer.  What are his intentions in the context of recapitalisation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I made it clear that the Government will continue to act in the overall interests of Irish business in order to ensure that employment remains at the maximum level and in order to maintain financial stability.  We will do so on the basis of the most up-to-date information and accurate analysis of the material provided by those acting on behalf of the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  We will not act in any other way.  There is a number of major options available to the banking sector.Capitalisation alone does not guarantee the access to credit we desire for Irish business.  Recapitalisation has taken place in respect of certain banks and this has enhanced the capital adequacy ratios of those institutions without necessarily changing their lending policies.  I will be insisting that in the business plans that have to be devised by those institutions covered by the State guarantee scheme, adequate lines of credit must be provided for Irish business.  If the banks fail to make such provision, their business plans will not be accepted by the Government.  We will be insisting that this mechanism be used as both an effective practical step and a means by which we can ensure that the banks meet their wider responsibilities.The idea that recapitalisation alone can provide the means by which increased lines of credit might be accessed by business interests is not, despite the Deputy's suggestion to the contrary, a comprehensive one.  There is every indication that the acquisition of capital might, as already stated, improve the capital ratios of the banks without increasing the lines of credit available to businesses.  We are in an extremely difficult situation, the ramifications relating to which are extremely broad.  The Government will take whatever decisions are necessary in the national interest.

Businesses are being starved of credit.  The position in this regard was outlined yesterday by the Small Firms Association, which indicated that many small businesses have experienced their worst month of trading for 20 years.  It also stated that unless specific actions are taken within a matter of days, the small business sector will implode and unemployment levels will soar.  The Small Firms Association drew attention to a €15 billion fund established by the European Investment Bank.  Banks in 22 of the 27 member states of the European Union have applied for and obtained money from that fund in order to assist the small business sectors in their jurisdictions.  However, the banks here, which are fully guaranteed by the State, have not applied to the fund.On Thursday last, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Bruton, stated that she was urging the banks to facilitate capital and credit for small businesses by accessing the funding available through the European Investment Bank.  She also stated that she and the Minister for Finance would be having further discussions with the banks in respect of this matter.When the bank guarantee scheme was introduced, we were informed — this was explicit in the scheme and the legislation — that the Minister for Finance was taking onto himself all kinds of powers to direct the banks in the public interest.  I have not seen evidence that this is happening.  Why is it that no Irish bank has sought to access the European Investment Bank fund, which would make available to small businesses the money they so desperately need and which has been accessed by banks in other countries in order to assist their small business sectors?  What has been done to direct Irish banks to take action in this regard?The Taoiseach referred to the examinations under way to establish the level of bad debt that will have to be written off by the Irish banks before recapitalisation can occur.  I understand the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, report was made available to the Financial Regulator earlier today.  I presume the Taoiseach and the Government are aware of the contents of that report.  Is that the case?  If it is, will the Taoiseach and the Government be in a position to make decisions in the near future in respect of the recapitalisation of the banks?

It provided the means by which access to liquidity could be provided to the Irish banks at a time, six weeks ago, when a real problem existed and continues to exist.  The issue before us this afternoon is Allied Irish Bank loans.  We are continuing to work with the banks to ensure that if they can get access to such loans they do so.Access to capital, private or otherwise, is a continuing concern for banks.  It is not correct to say that the Government is stepping back from the situation.  The Government is at an advanced stage in respect of all of these matters, which are commercially sensitive.  I am constrained in what I can say in regard to these matters at this particular time other than to say that the Government is seized of this issue in every respect and is considering all options in seeking to find a solution that will ensure lines of credit remain available to Irish business going forward.To suggest that the recapitalisation of the banks is the solution to that problem is not to see the full picture.  Business plans for the future are the best means, in practical terms, of doing this.

It now looks as though we are heading into the worst of both worlds, namely, a blanket guarantee for the banking system and, it would appear, an increasing inevitability of recapitalisation of the banks with taxpayers' money, which we were told the guarantee scheme was designed to avoid in the first instance.I want to return to the first question I asked of the Taoiseach.  Will he explain why the Irish banks have not availed of the European Investment Bank fund?  What is his response to the call by the Small Firms Association for the establishment of a small business operational fund of approximately €600 million which would make credit available to Irish businesses which are starved of credit from the banks and are facing into an uncertain future, many of whom have stated that may be put out of business in a matter of days?It is now six or seven weeks since the bank guarantee scheme was introduced and all the Taoiseach can offer is to come into this House and say he is awaiting this and that report and is examining every option; he cannot give direct answers on why the banks are not availing of the European Investment Bank fund.  Has the Taoiseach asked them why this is so?The Tánaiste told us last Thursday that she and the Minister for Finance were in discussions with the banks.  What discussions have taken place with the banks and what explanation have they given as to why, unlike their counterparts in 22 other member states, they have not availed of the fund established by the European Investment Bank?

As the Minister for Finance was written to, he has restated the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is not in question.  Arising from matters that were brought to my attention and discussions with the chairman and chief executive of FÁS, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate issues pertaining to the audit committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that his preferred option was to await the full outcome of the Committee of Public Accounts investigation.  I agreed to both issues on the basis that first, I asked rather than directed the Comptroller and Auditor General to proceed and, second, I did not have the financial wherewithal of €100,000 or €150,000 to appoint a consultant who could pursue the matter on my behalf.I have now discovered that due to other work, the Committee of Public Accounts is encountering difficulties in bringing matters to a conclusion.  Given the urgency of the matter, I have again requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to expedite his examination on my behalf.  These are the full facts of the matter.

The Tánaiste is now asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a further examination of FÁS in parallel to or undermining the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	212	This merits a debate in its own right.

In terms of the league of ministers for finance, the Financial Times placed that Minister just above the Portuguese Minister for Finance, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, at No. 17 out of 18.  Does the Tánaiste know what is happening? 
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	214	That is not an appropriate question for the Order of Business.  I call Deputy Gilmore.

Has the Government approved that Bill and when will it be published?When I last asked about the Bill to take medical cards from the over 70s, I was told it would be published before the end of November.  Does that remain the plan?  When is Second Stage likely to be held in this House?I am totally confused about the Government's intentions with regard to imposing a cap on spending limits for candidates in local elections.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced on 7 October that the Government would introduce legislation to cap spending.  I have asked on a number of occasions when and how the legislation would be introduced.  The last reply I received was that it had not yet been approved by the Government.  I do not know whether the Government intends to proceed with the plan, so I ask whether the Minister has brought proposals for imposing a cap on spending limits in local elections.

The health Bill will be brought forward at the end of November.  The other item to which Deputy Gilmore referred has not been completely finalised by the Minister.  From what I can ascertain, he is considering whether the proposals can be included in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008, which is being taken in the Seanad, with a view to taking Committee Stage later in the month.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	302	What is the legislation?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	303	——conscious economies.  Three Bills are listed, including the employment agency regulation Bill and the industrial development Bill, which is a possibility.  It would give the Tánaiste an opportunity to outline her plans for the industrial sector in the future and the retention of the maximum number of jobs.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Is there any other Bill?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Yes.  The other is one with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will empathise.  The Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, the Labour leader, Deputy Gilmore, and the relevant spokespersons from both parties have repeatedly raised in the House the obvious breakdown in the rule of law, whereby criminals are going free.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The Deputy cannot make a Second Stage speech.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I do not want to go through the entire list of Bills here.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The Deputy can do so if he wishes.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	309	All right.  Then in order——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	310	However, we will adjourn and move on to the next business.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I do not need to do that at all.  The issue is sufficiently important, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will readily agree, which is to confront lawlessness here.  I ask the Tánaiste——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	312	What is the Bill?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	313	——if the Government is making any serious attempt to introduce the legislation that will confront the criminal elements.  Is it intended to do anything about it at all?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	314	What is the Bill?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	316	Please, Deputy.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	317	Is it intended to ignore it?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	318	What is the Bill?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill is one.  The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is another one.  The criminal justice (money laundering) Bill is another.  It goes on.  I do not want to go through the entire list.  There is the civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, the civil partnership Bill, the criminal law (defence of life and property) Bill, the criminal law (insanity)(amendment) Bill——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Are there law and order provisions in the civil partnership Bill?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I note the Tánaiste thinks it is funny.  I do not think it is funny and the people outside the House do not think it is funny either.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Deputy——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The less fun the Tánaiste sees in that the better.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The Deputy should allow the Chair to keep order.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I agree.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The civil partnership Bill is not a criminal Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	327	It is appropriate on the Order of Business to ask when legislation will be taken.  The Deputy will appreciate that to go through the entire list would not be appropriate.  I believe the Deputy has listed some ten Bills, to which I will ask the Tánaiste to reply.  Perhaps the Deputy might save the rest until tomorrow.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I would be delighted.  I will be guided by your good counsel, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The heads of the industrial development Bill have been approved by Government.  We hope to have it this session if we get enough time to deal with it.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit for aggregate grants provided by agencies.  The heads of the industrial relations (amendment) Bill were approved and I know the Minister of State is working on it.We hope to introduce the first two criminal justice Bills this session.  I would not put the civil partnership Bill into the criminality area.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	330	It is a Bill in the justice area.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The criminal justice Bill will also be this session.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	332	When is it proposed to resume the debate on statements on Transport 21?  This would give us an opportunity to comment on the proposal I read yesterday to increase public transport costs by 10% at a time when the Environmental Protection Agency——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	333	That is not in order.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I will just finish.  The Environmental Protection Agency has reported an enormous increase in CO2 emissions in the transport area.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	335	When will that debate be resumed?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	336	Here we are endeavouring to transfer people to public transport and the Government is proposing to increase the cost by 10%, which is twice the rate of inflation.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	337	A blast from the past.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Transport 21 is about the roll-out of the programme.  I am sure that discussion can be facilitated in consultation with the Whips.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	339	It is a week today since, following a meeting together, the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner indicated there was no need for new legislation in the criminal law area and that the Garda had sufficient resources.We flatly contradicted that in the context of debate and will continue to do so.In regard to promised legislation and the third EU money laundering directive, the absence of appropriate money laundering legislation is facilitating gangland crime——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Hear, hear.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	341	——with drugs and money at its root.  This legislation has been promised and we are one of the few EU countries which has not transposed that third EU money laundering directive into our domestic legislation.  When will that happen?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	342	We hope to have it this session.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Hope is insufficient.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It all depends on how much time we make available to discuss such matters.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	346	We are charged with the responsibility of processing, enacting and scrutinising legislation.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Hear, hear.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	350	In the matter of the management companies referred to previously, which continue to exploit and abuse young families throughout the country, we have now established there will be one Bill — it took three years to get this far.  Has a Minister been assigned the task of preparing the Bill and when might we see it, as I hope it will regulate control and allow for the abolition of management companies?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Hear, hear.  It is tough going.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Is there any Government response to the decision by RTE to fly in the face of special legislation which we have passed in this House that required the organisation to broadcast to the Irish abroad and Britain, in particular?  Will legislation be required in the House to deal with the cuts in services to diabetics?

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	355	It will be under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but the Attorney General will put it together with the Parliamentary Counsel.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	364	Please, Deputy.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	365	When will the health information Bill be introduced in order that the HSE and the Minister will be forced to tell us the truth?  It is something the HSE knows nothing about.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The consultation process has been completed and the matter is being examined.  We do not have a date yet for the introduction of that piece of legislation.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The Bill I want to raise is related to that raised by Deputy Stagg, although I am not sure if it is the same Bill spoken about by the Tánaiste.  The National Property Services Regulatory Authority opened its office exactly a year ago in Meath.  It will have cost €600,000 to rent the office, keep its staff heated and so on, yet the authority has no legal powers to mediate between apartment owners and managing agents.  Will the appropriate Bill be given priority?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	368	It is a different piece of legislation and will be introduced this year.

Will that Bill make provision to make a person a ward of court?My second question relates to the animal welfare Bill.  Before I ask about the date for publication, I ask the Tánaiste what constitutes a consultation in anticipation of her answer.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The mental health legislation will be introduced in the middle of next year.  I have not had the opportunity to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he anticipates bringing that piece of legislation together.  It is significant and if I recall correctly from when I was Minister, I indicated to the committee that its input would be more than beneficial in the context of putting this legislation together.  I will ask the Minister when he anticipates publishing it.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Criminal Justice Acts, to abolish automatic remission of sentences in criminal cases, to provide a minimum 25 year term to be served on conviction of murder, to provide civil restrictions on persons involved in organised criminal activity and to provide for connected matters.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move:That the proposal that Dáil Éireann approves the following Orders in draft:(i) Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital Gains) (Republic Turkey) Order 2008, and(ii) Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Malta) Order 2008,copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 17th November, 2008, be referred to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service in accordance with paragraph (1) the Orders of Reference of that Committee, which, not later than 25th November, 2008, shall send a message to the Dáil in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, to delete lines 20 to 23.This amendment simply deals with the coming into operation of the Bill.  I do not propose to delay very long on some of these amendments but I will concentrate on substantive ones of definition.  It is interesting that on Committee Stage the defence of the text as it remains is that it is a convention relating to drafting.  I have a more conservative view, which is that the decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be responsible for the final definition of the text.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	381	We had a discussion on this on Committee Stage.  It is not just about parliamentary convention but as the Deputy knows, it has arisen from important practical reasons, such as the need to take cognisance and make necessary administrative and other arrangements before an Act can be properly implemented.  In the present case, Defence Forces training manuals must be adapted to take account of the State's new obligations under the convention on cluster munitions.  That convention is not yet in force and Article 17 provides it will enter into force only six months after the 30th instrument of ratification has been deposited.It is my intention to commence most parts of the Bill straight away, namely Part 1, preliminary and general; Part 3, anti-personnel mines; Part 4, investment of public moneys; and Part 5, penalties and miscellaneous provisions.  I also intend to commence Part 2, cluster munitions, as soon as possible.  It is the Government's intention that we should ratify the convention immediately after it has been signed on behalf of Ireland in Oslo on 3 December, making us one of the first countries in the world to ratify it, a clear demonstration of our commitment to early entry into force of the convention.  However, entry into force will only take place six months after the 30th instrument of ratification has been deposited, so we will be doing everything possible to encourage as many states to ratify it as soon as possible.

I was simply making a point in regard to any further legislation or in principle on any other legislation.  It is my belief that we are incapable of finitude in regard to text and legislation.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 3, to delete lines 30 to 33.The amendment relates to the definition of anti-handling devices.  It is a matter we discussed on Committee Stage and on which there remains a difference.  For the sake of economy and brevity I hope to make the fundamental case.  It is that something that has the consequence of being an anti-personnnel device — in the short term, medium term and long term — should be considered entirely from the point of view of the victim.  I cannot accept that there is a category of anti-personnel device that is somehow or another mitigated in terms of its consequences or impact.We discussed the matter on Committee Stage and I do not intend to delay the House with arguments that have been made previously.  The matters that are covered by amendments Nos. 2, 5 and 9 are the outcome of a consensus that was established in a declaration, which I welcome as a considerable advance.  The argument is whether one should confine oneself to that or not.  The argument was made therefore as to whether if one goes beyond the consensus one is somehow or another guilty of an absence of goodwill.  Two countries that will soon be signatories along with us to the convention are Belgium and Austria.  As I understand it, they have legislation that goes beyond the frame of the convention.  Their legislation could be construed as a complete ban on all munitions without the distinction of them being anti-handling or otherwise.  I am interested in something quite simple.  I see in the suggestion of the accommodation on anti-handling devices that technology has somehow or another mitigated the moral argument.Amendment No. 5 concerns the deletion of lines 42 to 46 relating to the definition of an anti-personnel mine.  I am interested to hear the Minister's reply to amendment No. 9.  Again, it was an issue that was raised on Committee Stage.  The amendment calls for the repeal of section 30(1)(e) of the Defence Act 1954, which gives the power to the Minister for Defence to “lay mines”.  It was my belief that it would be easier to repeal that section or make a request to repeal that aspect of the Act.The substantive issue is the definition of a cluster munition.  On page 4 of the amended legislation a definition is provided for a cluster munition as follows:"Cluster munition" means a conventional munition that is designed to disperse or release explosive submunitions each weighing less than 20 kilograms, and includes those explosive submunitions, but does not include the following:I see that list as a mitigation of a total ban, which is the main purpose with which I am dealing.  For example, section 2(1)(c) states: “a munition that, in order to avoid indiscriminate area effects and the risks posed by unexploded submunitions, has all of the following characteristics:”.  A general point arises as to whether in fact the available scientific and technical knowledge is able to specify a discrimination or whether one can put a fence around indiscriminate consequences.  Section 2(1)(c)(i) states, “each munition contains fewer than 10 explosive submunitions;”.  In order to save time later, if in fact one says the argument is that one uses nine cluster munitions and the first is successful in terms of achieving its target, what then happens to the other eight?I have considered the matter since Committee Stage in terms of what the NGO sector started out with and what it ended up with.  I accept the Minister's good faith on what he is seeking to achieve but I am anxious to go further in terms of having our legislation in such a way that it provides the maximum protection.  Perhaps the most horrific consequences are ones that occur long after the immediate conflict has taken place.  We must consider whether the technical definition provided offers the protection we want in the immediate sense or consequent to conflicts.  I am in favour of the more simple total prohibition on all anti-personnel missiles on the basis that it is stronger.  I am not convinced by the suggestion that one can have such a sophisticated missile that it knows its intention is aimed at a tank and, given the possible success of one missile out of nine that the remainder should not therefore damage civilians.  That is the crux of what remains in terms of Report Stage amendments.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I debated the issues with Deputy Higgins on Committee Stage.  Section 2 makes provision for the interpretation of key terms as defined in the conventions on cluster munitions and the ban on anti-personnel mines.  The key issue is consistency with what has been negotiated with all the other states.  The success of the Dublin convention was the fact that up to 114 different countries arrived in Dublin and we managed to reach an agreement.  If different states were to define these key terms in their domestic legislation in different ways, co-operation between the parties to the convention would become extremely complex and would inevitably frustrate future coherent implementation of the convention itself.The area of definitions was one of the most difficult in agreeing the convention.  It is important that when we are negotiating with other states that we demonstrate our bona fides subsequently.  It could cause considerable difficulty in the future when one is working with like-minded states to develop international conventions on other issues.  If, subsequently, each member state does its own thing there would be a breakdown in terms of collegiality and the sense of confidence that is necessary when like-minded states work together.The impact of the amendment would be to blur the distinction between an anti-personnel mine and an anti-tank mine equipped with an anti-handling device.  The first is prohibited by the anti-personnel mine ban convention, while the second is not.  In essence, there would be an undesirable level of uncertainty concerning anti-tank mines equipped with anti-handling devices if we were to accept the amendment.Let me return to the fundamental point.  Applying standards in our laws that differ from those being adopted by other states party to the convention would risk, at best, severely complicating international co-operation in the implementation of the convention.  As I stated on Committee Stage, of equal importance is the fact that the proposed amendments would effectively prevent the Defence Forces from participating in peacekeeping or other similar missions with almost any other country, whether it was a party to the convention, because we would have implemented a different standard of prohibition.  The prohibition relates not just to the use of the defined munition — in this case, an anti-personnel mine — but also to assisting any other country that might use it.  If the Irish definition is different from the agreed convention definition, other countries may very well be using a munition prohibited under Irish law but permitted by the convention.  The purpose of the convention is, conversely, to standardise prohibitions.On the proposed repeal of section 30(1)(e) of the Defence Act 1954, I have consulted the Minister for Defence, as I said I would do on Committee Stage.  His position is that he cannot accept the amendment.  The provision concerned is an enabling one only permitting the Minister for Defence to lay mines.  However, it must be exercised in accordance with the State’s international legal obligations, including the anti-personnel mine ban convention, the convention on certain conventional weapons and the Geneva Conventions.The term "mines" in the 1954 Act is not restricted to anti-personnel mines but includes anti-tank mines and sea mines.  The laying of any of these mines may only be done in accordance with applicable international law.  In the case of anti-personnel mines, that means only for the purpose of training in mine clearance techniques, in accordance with the provisions of the convention.  Moreover, repeal of the section would raise doubts as to the lawfulness of laying any mine because the statutory power to do so would have been distinguished.  This, in turn, would greatly complicate the ability of the Defence Forces to train for clearance and destruction, among other purposes.  That is the rationale for not accepting the amendment.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Minister has encouraged me to stray from the particular to the general on this matter.  However, I will first refer to amendment No. 9.  On the Minister's last point, when he is reviewing the Explosives Act 1875, at the base of our current legislation on landmines, he might consider the 1954 Act.  One cannot have it both ways in regard to interpretation.  We can leave this amendment aside as it is the least contentious.On the other two amendments, the issue that arises is that the Minister has chosen to extend the grounds of his objection to my amendments to the general.  In the case of the landmines legislation considered when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I were Cabinet members, the decision of the then Tánaiste was to establish a template of legislation and seek consensus within it.  In this particular case the consensus falls short, to some extent, of the lead given in some of the Belgian and Austrian legislation.  I do not accept the Minister's principle.  My interpretation is actually the better one of trust between nations in their recognition of the consensus established at the heart of their own legislation.  It involves a rather minimalist and pejorative view of diplomacy to suggest that, because one has an external frame or agreement, excellence is achieved by remaining strictly within it.  It is equally evident from the history of diplomatic achievement that when one includes the agreement and transcends it, one is retaining forward movement for the defence of civilians.The Minister has associated this group of three amendments with the question of interoperability.  On Committee Stage I was very much interested in hearing the guarantee he was giving.  His reply on having a different definition from that of other countries leads to a different consideration.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	389	——the modus operandi by which it was achieved is, by definition, deserving of commendation.  Consider the consequences if, as a Minister, I agreed with ten other Ministers on the standard to be set and two or three of the countries, for example, had a difficultly.  In the case of the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, intervened personally to enable the United Kingdom to agree to the convention.  I am not so sure countries would be so willing to agree if they found out the following month that those states with which they were agreeing took a different approach to them, thus putting them under more pressure.  If one adopted a collegial approach but then adopted a new approach on reaching agreement, parties to the agreement would feel “once bitten, twice shy” in respect of engaging with one again.  One can argue the point both ways; one can be in splendid isolation for 20 years by adopting a certain view on a matter or one can seek to create a standard.  The ultimate success of the convention will depend on the stigmatisation of the weapons.  The convention creates the momentum for that stigmatisation, such that even those who have not signed up to it will be dissuaded from using the weapons.There is a difference between an anti-handling device and an anti-personnel mine.  I recognise it, although I am not a military expert.  Those who worked on the convention made this distinction.  In the Bill, we are remaining faithful to the definitions agreed and on which we sought agreement while chairing the convention process.  I would not be disposed to straying from what we signed up to in a bona fide way.

Far from it, it is a question of adequacy in what we are seeking to achieve.  We differ regarding the construction of the consensus achieved.  I share the Minister's view on stigmatisation, which is what we should seek in regard to those states which use the weapons in question.  An issue arises as to the sufficiency of moral suasion to urge non-signatories to sign up to the convention.Consider my view on foreign policy construction as a choice between idealism and the view that the following of interests should prevail.  I have held a different view on this from others, including such distinguished ministerial predecessors as Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  When the history of Irish policy is written, we will find policy has been more damaged by excessive concentration on interests than principles.  We would note this in the history of the Department if we were considering the detailed history of the preparations for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other treaties.  There is a genuine difference but I am not arguing for splendid isolation, rather I am arguing for encouraging people to raise the bar.  Those who argue against my position are more pessimistic in regard to the goodwill evident for the achievement of a general ban.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 4, to delete lines 21 to 33.It is not necessary to delay the House with this amendment because I made arguments on the definition in our discussion of the previous amendments.  Amendment No. 3 which would have the effect of deleting section 2(1)(c) calls into question the provision which would exclude from the definition of “cluster munition” a munition that, in order to avoid indiscriminate area effects and the risks posed by unexploded submunitions, has a number of characteristics, which are listed.  I have made my case on this issue.I acknowledge that the House has accepted the argument that, as far as this Legislature is concerned, that which has been agreed is the substantive matter to be addressed in this legislation.  Nevertheless, it behoves those who accept the inclusion of section 2(1)(c) to technically validate its provisions.  For example, while the inclusion in the list of ammunition containing fewer than ten explosive submunitions is an achievement in so far as it is some limitation, it leaves open the question I put about whether technology can answer the question as to the discriminate or indiscriminate nature of the remaining nine explosive devices in the event that the first submunition explodes successfully.  The issue of weight, on which neither me nor the Minister claims to be an expert, also arises.I wish to dispose of the view that I hold an idle, idealist position.  We have had that argument.  If the text is retained, a straightforward argument could be made that the provisions of the Bill are what it was pragmatically possible to achieve.  While I can accept this, it does not refute the argument that it would have been better to have a complete ban without the exceptions listed in section 2(1)(c).  It is, if one likes, a moral and epistemological question as to how one defines an exception.  An exception does not defeat the principle.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Under no circumstances do I perceive the Deputy's position to be one of an idle idealist.  He has been committed to and active in this entire process.  On the other hand, I would not describe the standards in the definitions achieved as minimalist.  They are comprehensive and of a high order.  The definition of what constitutes a cluster munition was, as we know, one of the difficult issues encountered during the negotiations in Dublin.  The guiding principle was to reach agreement on the prohibition of all cluster munitions that caused unacceptable harm to civilians.  The definition, as set out in the Bill, reproduces the one agreed in the negotiations.  It is comprehensive and meets the objective of prohibiting all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The convention prohibits all types of cluster munitions that have ever been used in an armed conflict.  Following proposals made by the Government, it also prohibits explosive bomblets specifically designed to be released from dispensers of fixed wing aircraft in the same way as cluster munitions.  This is an extremely important provision which closes potential loopholes created by new technologies.As the Deputy said, in terms of our discussion on the last set of amendments, there is the issue of consistency in applying the standards we have agreed with like-minded countries.  We would risk severely complicating international co-operation and implementation conventions, particularly in the context of international peacekeeping operations.  The Defence Forces have to work with the armies of other states in peacekeeping missions.  At worst, we could make it impossible for them to engage in such missions.The convention sets out the standards agreed by all states involved in the negotiations.  If each state, in turn, were to apply different standards in its domestic laws, the convention would be unworkable.  We had this debate on Committee Stage and while I appreciate the Deputy's viewpoint and perspective, I am not disposed to accept the amendment for the reasons outlined.

In page 4, line 36, after "Schedule 1“, to insert the following:", but Article 21(3) of the said Convention may not be relied on by the State".On Committee Stage the Minister, in relation to amendment No. 7, made a helpful statement by way of clarification as regards the circumstances that would govern co-operation between Irish and other forces.  My reason for retaining the amendment, however, was my concern that the protection in place referred to criminality liability on the part of a serving officer.  To some extent, it did not address the fundamental issue as to whether such munitions should be used in the first place.  The question of the strength of an assurance then arose as regards a co-operating force involved in a shared action and the degree to which one should ask such a question.  It is interesting because, without upsetting too many people, I am convinced by the international legal opinion that is so overwhelming as regards another matter, namely, the inadequacy of international assurances in relation to compliance, say, in the UN convention against torture.  That is my view for consideration on another day, but in exactly the same manner I am thinking about the discourse that should govern those co-operating in a particular situation as to what assurances should be sought and given from one side or another.  The Minister went a considerable way on Committee Stage in acknowledging what was, in fact, the substance of amendment No. 7.  It is less so in the case of amendment No. 4.  I am interested in his reply.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	395	We considered amendments No. 4 and 7 on Committee Stage.  The effect of both would be to prevent the participation of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations with countries that may not be parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  They would affect the provisions of the Bill concerning inter-operability, dealt with in Article 21 of the convention and section 7 of the Bill.  As I said during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill, Article 21 of the convention was the most difficult to resolve in the negotiations at Croke Park, an agreement was only reached literally at the last moment.  Given the importance all Members attach to Ireland's continued involvement in international peacekeeping operations, it would be useful if I were to go into some detail on Article 21 and the provisions of section 7 which will implement it.Article 21 states, "States Parties, their military personnel or nationals, may engage in military cooperation and operations with States not parties to this Convention that might engage in activities prohibited to a State party".  This provision takes account of the fact that, at least initially, not all states will be parties to the convention and that some may continue to retain cluster munitions.  This was a particular concern of members of NATO, for example, because the United States had been clear in its opposition to the Oslo process.  When considering Article 21, it is important to note that each state party is obliged to encourage states not party to the convention to become a party to it and, where it engages in military co-operation or operations with these states, to notify them of its obligations under the convention, promote the norms established by the convention and make its best efforts to discourage them from using cluster munitions.Article 21 does not specifically authorise a state party to develop, produce or otherwise acquire cluster munitions; to stockpile or transfer cluster munitions; to use cluster munitions; or to expressly request the use of cluster munitions in cases where the choice of munitions used is within its exclusive control.  We believe the convention's prohibition on cluster munitions will, in time, as I said, become established as a new norm of international humanitarian law.  This will happen when states begin to feel obliged to behave in accordance with it, regardless of whether they are parties to it.  As we know, it has happened very successfully in the context of the anti-personnel mine ban convention, even though a number of states which now observe its norms are not party to it.  We will tend to work internationally with our partners to ensure the Convention on Cluster Munitions will have a similar effect.Article 21 is implemented by section 7 of the Bill, of which subsection (4) provides for particular circumstances that may arise in relation to the participation of members of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions with states which are not parties to the convention.  As I said both on Second Stage and Committee Stage, we expect the likelihood of participation in missions such as this to be very low.  Section 7(4) provides that on such admission, a member of the Defence Forces shall not be guilty of the offence of assisting, inducing or encouraging the commission of any of the offences created by section 6(1) of the Bill.  However, if he or she does any of the political things prohibited — use, develop, induce etc. — he or she will be guilty of an offence.  That subsection (4) is intended to address only exceptional and very unlikely circumstances such as where an Irish contingent of a UN-mandated peacekeeping force, for example, finds itself under attack and needs to call for support, either from the air or land-based artillery, to relieve it.  It may happen that fire support is provided by the forces of another state participating in the mission which is not a party to the convention and it is conceivable that it might be delivered without the knowledge of the Irish contingent in the form of cluster munitions.  The Bill provides that in such a scenario no member of the Defence Forces could be prosecuted for inducing or encouraging the use of cluster munitions contrary to section 6(2) of the Bill.I have to emphasise, as I did on Committee Stage, that everything possible will be done to avoid such a scenario.  As I said during the Second Stage debate, our preference in considering contributions to peacekeeping missions will be to join with states that are parties to the convention.  In such circumstances the question of inter-operability with states not party to it will not arise.  However, even where we define ourselves as a member of a peacekeeping mission that includes the armed forces of a state not a party to the convention, every effort will be made, in the elaboration of codes of conduct, rules of engagement, caveats and similar agreements, to ensure there is no prospect of cluster munitions playing any role.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that section 7(4) will ever apply.  However, all Members of the House will agree on the importance of ensuring no member of the Defence Forces should ever face prosecution for simply carrying out his or her duty as a member of a peacekeeping mission.

I do not want to put into text something which would have the consequence of impairing the capacity to respond quickly or be part of a peacekeeping force, or in exceptional circumstances endangering serving Irish personnel.  I made the point on it and the Minister's assurances given on Committee Stage and Report Stage are very strong, and in those circumstances I withdraw this amendment.

With the passing of time such an amendment may not be necessary.  It is important to remember that regarding cluster munitions or other weapons, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and if the weapon is used in a defensive position it can be quite productive and progressive.  Taking on board the point the Minister has made and the potential impact this would have for our peacekeeping forces, and from a pragmatic point of view, it would not be possible for me to support the amendment.

In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(a) is committed by an Irish citizen or gives rise to injury to or death of an Irish citizen,”.We do not need to delay on this.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the extra territorial scope of the Bill to ensure offences by or against Irish citizens are prohibited.  The legislation as amended on Committee Stage lists a number of parties and this amendment extends it to the citizen.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	404	We discussed this.  Section 6 of the Bill creates certain criminal offences regarding cluster munitions and explosive bomblets in accordance with the obligations the State will assume under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  Section 9 creates similar offences for anti-personnel mines and both provisions extend the jurisdiction of the State for these offences beyond the territory of the State to acts committed on board Irish registered ships or aircraft, or committed by members of the Defence Forces.  This is in accordance with the established principles of international law.The Deputy's proposed amendments as I said on Committee Stage would further extend the jurisdiction of the State to cover cases in which the perpetrator of the act is an Irish citizen.  My advice is that as a matter of legal policy Ireland has only ever extended criminal jurisdiction in such a manner on a very limited basis.  This is primarily because of the large number of Irish citizens around the world, many of whom have dual nationality.Accordingly, the State has been very conservative is exercising jurisdiction on this basis and has only done so where there is broad international consensus on the character of activity concerned, such as murder, manslaughter and certain sexual offences involving children.  It would be very problematic to extend the State's criminal jurisdiction over acts that are lawful if committed in another state of which the perpetrator is a citizen.  An Irish citizen with dual citizenship could be serving in the US army and commit an act that would be legal in a state not party to the convention, yet we would seek to prosecute.The main focus of Deputy Higgins's amendment was to try and target mercenaries.  Irish citizens may participate as mercenaries in armed conflict outside the State.  We considered the issue of mercenaries between Committee and Report Stage and it is a wide and complex issue.  In general terms the status of mercenaries is governed by the first protocol additional to the Geneva Convention which provides that mercenaries shall not have the right to combatant status.  In practice it is open to a party to an armed conflict to accord a mercenary combatant status.  A person granted combatant status is not subject to criminal prosecution but is entitled to prisoner of war status if captured.  If not granted such status a person will come within the criminal jurisdiction of the state on whose territory he or she acts.  There are complexities involved and we know some states use mercenaries.  It is an issue that falls outside the specific scope of this Bill and we are not in a position to accept the amendment because of this reason.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	405	At the end of my discussion on a related amendment on Committee Stage I introduced the question of the position of mercenaries, and I had a particular reason for that.  I can see the goodwill of the Minister towards the spirit of my amendment but he is unwilling to accept it due to difficulties in implementation.The use of the position of non-combatants in the Geneva Convention is not helpful.  It is a strategy employed by the Government of the United States to handle many people who are deprived of the basic elements of the protection of international law in Guantanamo Bay.  It is also something related to operability in the field, the wearing of a uniform and what constitutes a uniform, and Deputy Timmins would know of the application of that part of the Geneva Convention.  It is an area of discussion that may belong to a different occasion.I am interested in the consistency between the point I am arguing in this amendment and what I argued on the control of exports as it governs military equipment.  I did not succeed, but I made a case for the importance of securing information on end use and argued that if something is used in a military way, one takes responsibility for its final usage.  As one looks at what is produced it floats out of control and moves into an unaccountable area.Regarding this particular matter, the reputation of the country would be damaged if it decided to look aside, and I am not accusing the Government of that.I am not going to dwell on this, but not so long ago I was in Karamojo, northern Uganda where once people were cattle rustlers and used spears, but now in the marketplace people are buying and selling guns.  There are no places producing armaments on the continent of Africa, but they have been introduced as instruments of death.  I appreciate this might not be the place to do what I was trying to do with my amendment, to cast the net so wide that anybody who ever participated in transactions involving departures from the spirit of this legislation would be within our remit.I am not convinced by the argument that people might find themselves in a group or in an army that was a non-signatory.  This argument does not move me because I have a view that is even more conservative than that of the Minister with regard to personal responsibility.  The fact the State is throwing its net abroad and as widely as possible does not bother me.  That is where I am not conservative.  The balance of personal responsibility exists, but I believe the State should be an activist with regard to seeking to get compliance with good legislation.  This is undoubtedly good legislation, even if it is less than perfect.

However, I suggest to the Minister that he should alert his colleague the Minister for Defence of the necessity of achieving what I have suggested in it.  We can come back to the matter on another occasion.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Thank you.  We can come back to it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Amendment Nos. 10, 11 and 12 are related and will be discussed together.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 12, line 5, to delete "€250,000" and substitute "€1,000,000".In essence, this amendment is that of Deputy Timmins.  I said on Committee Stage that I would respond to Deputy Timmins who first proposed what are now amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  I am sympathetic to his aims.  We have consulted Parliamentary Counsel on appropriate formulations and these now appear as amendments Nos. 10 and 12.On the question of increasing the maximum fine that can be imposed for conviction under sections 6 or 9, amendment No. 10, I agree with the Deputy that this should be raised from €250,000 to €1 million.  While a substantial prison sentence of ten years may be imposed on individuals for the commission of the most serious offences under these provisions, the situation of a body corporate must also be considered.  If a body corporate, rather than its managers or employees, is convicted of such an offence, a penalty of imprisonment could not be imposed.  In those circumstances — I am thinking here of a large scale production or distribution operation — a fine capable of being substantial would be the appropriate penalty.I am also satisfied that on conviction, it should be within the discretion of the court, in addition to imposing a fine and-or a custodial sentence on any offender, to require that person to contribute to the costs of destroying any munitions that were the subject of the criminal proceedings.  This is provided for in amendment No. 12.  I am unable, therefore, to accept amendment No. 11.

Amendment No. 10 is straightforward.  The Minister deals with my amendment No. 11 in amendment No. 12.  This makes sense.  If someone was caught illegally dumping, that person would have to pay the costs involved.  Therefore, it makes sense that costs involved with illegal munitions would also be imposed on those involved.  I thank the Minister for accepting this.Will the Minister confirm that this will also apply to the body corporate as in amendment No. 11?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Yes, it does.

In page 12, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"(2) Where a cluster munition, explosive bomblet or anti-personnel mine is to be delivered to the Defence Forces for destruction under subsection (1), the court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for not doing so, order the convicted person to pay the costs and expenses, measured by the court, to be incurred by the Defence Forces in relation to arranging such destruction.(3) An order for costs and expenses under subsection (2) is in addition to and not instead of any fine or penalty the court might impose under section 17.”.

In page 12, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"20.—(1) The Minister shall by regulations establish and publish a register of persons outside of Ireland which trade in cluster munitions, to be known as the Register of Prohibited Investment in Cluster Munitions.(2) The Minister shall by regulations provide for persons to be placed on and withdrawn from the Register of Prohibited Investment in Cluster Munitions.(3) The Minister shall publish in Iris Oifigiúil the names placed on and withdrawn from the Register of Prohibited Investment in Cluster Munitions and shall notify the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Financial Regulator of such publication.”.On Committee Stage the Minister indicated he would inquire from the Department of Finance whether this was possible.  I would like to hear his view on it.  It is something that is desirable, but I would like to hear the practicalities involved.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	416	As the House will recall, I introduced a new Part 4 of the Bill by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  That new part puts in place a clear legislative framework providing that any statutory investment mandate is qualified by requirement to exclude investments in the manufacturers of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines.  Part 4 sets down the requirement to avoid initial investments of public moneys, directly or indirectly, in manufacturers of prohibited munitions.  It also sets out clear requirements and guidelines for dealing with these circumstances, where such investments occur despite best efforts to avoid them.Deputy Timmins proposes that a register of prohibited investments be published.  He suggested on Committee Stage that those charged with investing public moneys in assessing their own investments would work off some such list.  However, the Minister for Finance advises me that such a list will not be compiled by those investing public moneys.  Instead, in practice, as part of a standard due diligence with regard to any prospective investment, an investor of public moneys must satisfy him or herself on the basis of investigation and research that the company concerned and its subsidiaries do not engage in the manufacture of or trade in cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines.As I indicated on Committee Stage, the production of a register is likely to engage considerable human and financial resources.  Moreover, it is unlikely ever to be exhaustive or complete and inevitably will not be a reliable tool for investors.  The best means of ensuring that companies around the world stop making these weapons is to promote ratification of the convention by more of the countries in which they operate.  Also, those investing public moneys must do the due diligence exercise and investigate appropriately.

I pay tribute too to the staff of the Department, who throughout the negotiations in Croke Park and in preparation for the legislation were an admirable example of an activist Department operating out of a rights perspective.  They deserve our admiration for that.  For the future of humanity, I wish this legislation the maximum number of signatories and ratification.  I hope it has the effect everyone in the House wants.

My only regret is that the Minister's predecessor did not accept our Bill as we could have had it in place before the convention, but perhaps that magnanimous gesture might not have tied in with his personality.  I am sure this Minister would have.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  They, on behalf of their parties, have shown a strong commitment that has endured.  I appreciate their co-operation on the passage of the legislation through this House.  I also pay tribute to my predecessor who was very involved at the initial stage of this with other like-minded countries.  It is an achievement for Ireland that we negotiated the final stages of this convention in Croke Park, in Dublin.  It is an historic convention that will impact on humankind.I recall meeting victims of cluster munitions at the Croke Park convention.  When one meets the victims, one sees at first hand the appalling impact of cluster munitions on them, their families and their lives, as well as on entire communities.  This is an important Bill and while it may not receive the same profile as do other issues, it will have a decided impact on the future of humankind in future conflicts.  Members should not understate what they have done in this regard.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to introduce the Gas (Amendment) Bill for the consideration of this House.  This is a short Bill with just one provision, namely, to increase the statutory borrowing limit of Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, from its existing €1.7 billion to €3 billion.  However, it is significant as its enactment will give Bord Gáis Éireann the legal ability to access funds to develop the strategic direction set out in its five-year corporate plan up to 2012 and beyond.This Bill proposes to amend section 23 of the Gas Act 1976, which provides for borrowings by BGE for capital purposes.  BGE was established in 1976 with a mandate to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that was both economical and efficient.  The original borrowing limit in 1976 was £25 million.  Since then, BGE has played a vital part in the growth of the Irish economy through the development of a gas network that runs to almost 12,500 km of pipeline serving more than 600,000 customers.  A total of 18 counties in Ireland and four in Northern Ireland now are connected to the natural gas network.The statutory borrowing limit has been amended a number of times in the last 30 years in order that BGE could have access to funds for the development of its network.  In 2002, the limit was increased by section 31 of the Sustainable Energy Act from €700 million to €1.7 billion to provide BGE with access to the resources necessary to carry out an unprecedented programme of development.In the past ten years, the network has been transformed through the construction of the pipeline to the west, which stretches from Dublin to Galway and down to Limerick; the South-North pipeline from Dublin to Belfast, providing security of supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland, as well as supplying towns en route; the Mayo-Galway pipeline, which has facilitated the delivery of natural gas to several towns along the route in both Galway and Mayo and which will facilitate the transportation of Corrib gas to the Irish market in due course; the north-west pipeline from Belfast to Derry, which also supplies towns along the route; and the second gas interconnector with Scotland, which has secured the supply of gas to Ireland since its completion in 2002.Bord Gáis Éireann's gross borrowing is expected to reach the existing statutory borrowing limit of €1.7 billion early in 2009.  The existing debt is made up mainly of long-term facilities put in place to fund the large gas transmission projects, to which I have just referred, that were completed over the last seven to eight years.  For example, the pipeline to the west cost €400 million and the second interconnector cost €300 million.  Both were delivered on time and within the final control budget.  The expansion of the gas network in recent years from 8,200 km in 2000 to its current 12,500 km also has been funded by long-term debt matching the expected life of the infrastructure.The operation and development of the gas network over the next five years includes adding another 1,500 km of pipeline to the network, the connection of 150,000 new customers, replacement of the remaining cast iron network with polyethylene pipes and investment in new systems and technology to provide improved customer service.  BGE also will continue to meet its emergency response standards and pipeline safety standards.  The expansion of the pipeline network includes the connection of 17 towns, including 12 on the Mayo-Galway pipeline.In recent years BGE has entered the retail electricity market.  While its customer base at present is mainly in the industrial-commercial sector, BGE intends entering the domestic retail electricity market in 2009.  This will provide welcome competition for the existing incumbent.  BGE already has the necessary customer service, billing systems and mechanisms in place in respect of its retail gas business to support a domestic retail electricity service.  The savings made in this area will provide value to both BGE and its customers.Bord Gáis Éireann also is in the process of constructing a 445 MW combined-cycle gas turbine electricity generating plant at Whitegate, Cork.  The board's plan is to develop a portfolio of electricity generating plant, including renewable generation and flexible power plants to support the renewable generation.  This access to its own supply of electricity will ensure a stable vertically-integrated business model which in turn will ensure BGE's long-term competitive commitment to the electricity retail market.Overall, BGE has an ambitious capital investment programme of up to €2 billion over the next five years with a view to becoming a competitive dual-fuel supplier in the Irish market.  The Government's energy policy framework document up to 2020, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, supports the sustainable development of the State energy companies.  Competition and environmental sustainability are key pillars of the policy framework.  BGE's proposed investments in the coming years will play a key role in achieving these objectives.  The enactment of this legislation, therefore, to increase BGE's statutory borrowing limit to €3 billion is an integral part of this process.The development of business interests outside of its traditional core business of natural gas transportation and supply will not have a negative impact on the price of gas to BGE's customers.  On the contrary, it should have the opposite effect.  BGE's gas business is regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  BGE is allowed a regulated rate of return on its transportation business.  It can only recover costs on investments approved by the CER.  In setting the rate of return, the CER applies the cost and level of borrowing of an efficiently operated and financed company with comparable systematic risks to BGE.  The board therefore is incentivised to borrow funds as efficiently as possible.  It is also incentivised to outperform regulatory targets to provide best value for its customers.All Members are aware that BGE was granted a 20% increase in gas prices by the CER with effect from last August.  It had been expected that a further increase would be granted in December to reflect the huge increases in world gas prices recently.  However, BGE has advised that based on current trends in wholesale gas prices, it may not require another increase in December.I referred earlier to BGE's contribution to the development of the Irish economy since its foundation.  Not only has the board developed a robust gas supply network, including connection to the UK grid to ensure security of supply in the longer term, it also has contributed €630 million in dividends to the Exchequer since its foundation.  A further dividend of €28.4 million will be paid to the Exchequer before the end of this year. In the eight years since 2000, BGE has increased turnover from €496 million to €1.2 billion and profits have increased from €70 million to €142 million.  Moreover, net assets have increased from €672 million to €1.3 billion, putting the utility on a sound financial footing.  This success has allowed BGE to develop its network continually, making a vital contribution to the national economy and providing excellent service to its customer base.  It is in a strong position to meet the challenges facing it in respect of environmental sustainability and competition while ensuring a safe and secure supply of natural gas.It is important to note that an increase in BGE's statutory borrowing limit does not give it permission to raise its borrowing to this level.  Each project put forward by BGE will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The board itself is obliged to act in the best interests of BGE and no proposals would be supported that would put the long-term sustainable future of the utility at any unnecessary risk.  Ongoing borrowing levels will be monitored and will be subject to full commercial criteria, such as ability to repay and protection of the balance sheet.In conclusion, this Bill is an important measure in the delivery of the Government's energy policy.  I therefore welcome the views of Members on the proposed increase in BGE's statutory borrowing limit to €3 billion to provide access to funds necessary for the roll-out of its strategic investment programme over the next five years and beyond.  I look forward to Members' assistance in furthering the Bill's progress into law.

I trust the Minister will not take offence at a Tipperary man standing in for a Cork man.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	423	No.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	424	We do so on a regular basis.I wish to give a guarded welcome to the Bill.  Fine Gael supports its introduction, subject to some concerns it has in this regard.  However, it is important to recognise that Bord Gáis Éireann is ideally positioned and well placed at present to take advantage of the financial position that has been made available to it.  It should be acknowledged that it has made good use of the funding it has received or the amount of money it has been able to raise since the last time its level of borrowing was increased in 2002.  On consideration of its subsequent record, there is not too much to worry about.  The company has made strident progress in recent years and is conforming to a large degree with the Minister's three pillars of security, competitiveness and meeting the environment's requirements.  Much of Bord Gáis's current and proposed work is helpful to the Minister in meeting his targets.The Minister pointed out that Bord Gáis is A plus rated and has a balance sheet capable of taking on increased debt and necessary expenditure.  The Minister will confirm whether its debt levels are okay.  It is important that a company like Bord Gáis, led by an energetic young chief executive, be given encouragement because it is brave and, given the recession, its major plans are vital.  These will not only be worthwhile to the State, but also to the domestic and small to large business sectors.  It is important that a competitive element be introduced and kept alive by Bord Gáis and that it be allowed to develop and increase its role.Given some of its proposed work, particularly in gas storage by way of caverns, it will provide security of service in the event of, for example, the Russians suffering a rush of blood to the head and cutting off supply.  The construction of a 445 MW power station at Whitegate is the type of development required by the country.  When others are concerned, it is good to see a company led by an energetic CEO making strident progress.  As parliamentarians, we have an obligation to support Bord Gáis and to allow it to provide necessary funding, which is the main purpose of the Bill.  Small businesses and entrepreneurs are finding it difficult to raise money from banks.  The Minister will confirm that Bord Gáis will have no difficulty in this respect and that finance will be available for it in Ireland, Europe or wherever.Given some of Bord Gáis's recent acquisitions, such as its €50 million purchase of a wind farm in County Galway and the consequent €50 million on that wind farm's development, it is amazing that each megawatt produced by wind farms costs €200,000.  The credit squeeze is helpful to larger players like Bord Gáis, which can buy wind farms when ordinary individuals find it difficult to arrange financing to establish and maintain them.In light of how the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has increased the capacity available in the next round of licensing from 3,000 MW to 3,900 MW, Bord Gáis is placing itself in a position to avail of the current capacity and to be ready to sprint during the upturn.  While I do not know when that will be, it will come as surely as night follows day.  Bord Gáis is to be commended on placing itself in that position.I noted in the Minister's speech that Bord Gáis will not be given carte blanche in terms of its funding or activities.  Each project must be approved by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  We should look after the taxpayer if something goes wrong.  To our cost, something went wrong in the banking sector in particular.  I would not want Bord Gáis joining the four Bs that have created the recession.  I am not referring to four banks.  Rather, I mean Bertie, Brian, banks and builders.  I am satisfied that adequate controls will be placed on Bord Gáis and that its money will be invested wisely.The Minister stated there may be no increase in consumer charges, but he should be stronger on this issue.  It is essential that there be no increase in January.  Bord Gáis is seeking an increase of 3.9% on top of the 20% increase granted last summer.  Businesses, particularly smaller ones, are to the pin of their collar and there are significant concerns regarding staff redundancies.  Everyone, including Bord Gáis, the CER and the Minister, has a part to play in ensuring price increases are kept to a minimum.  Given the collapse in global oil prices, the Minister should tell Bord Gáis that there should be no increase in January, particularly in respect of domestic customers.  It would be unwarranted and unjustified and would do serious damage to businesses, particularly the small businesses and entrepreneurs on whom we are depending to create new business and employment.  Will the Minister address this issue and be more determined in his objection to a price increase?Like the ESB, many of Bord Gáis's competitive advantages lie in its being a dual power provider.  An example of these advantages benefiting the business and domestic sectors is its scheme, in conjunction with the IFA, to provide gas and electricity to rural communities at a substantially reduced price.That many households are unable to connect to Bord Gáis is a disadvantage for the company.  Where the service is available, the connection cost is approximately €2,500 and is beyond many households' means.  According to a Bord Gáis study, it introduced an incentive in one part of the country by providing a €1,000 bonus, but only 17 domestic users applied.  The Minister should consider introducing a scheme whereby households could connect to Bord Gáis where its service is available.  The Government might consider taking action in this regard in order to reduce the cost and to encourage people to use gas which, we have been informed, is a cleaner fuel than some others.  I look forward to the Minister's comments on incentives of this nature.The Minister referred to the good work Bord Gáis, in conjunction with assistance from the Government, has been doing and indicated that its gas pipeline runs to approximately 12,500 km and that some 18 counties are serviced by it.  Not one inch of pipeline was laid in Tipperary North.  The Minister might state that I would say this, given that I represent the constituency.  However, that constituency, which has been crisscrossed by motorways, does not have access to natural gas.  In addition, it has been left behind in respect of certain issues over a number of years.  Will the Minister ensure that north Tipperary is included in the next round of developments?  Towns such as Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea should have access to this natural resource.  I understand a draft report is being drafted by Bord Gáis, the Government and the CER.  I urge the Minister to ensure north Tipperary, particularly the towns to which I referred, is catered for in the next expansion of the gas network.As already stated, a number of motorways have and are being constructed in north Tipperary.  Why was it not possible to put in place infrastructural corridors adjacent to these motorways?  There should be joined-up thinking on the part of various Departments when infrastructural developments of this nature are taking place because it could assist in the avoidance of much disruption and the carrying out of unnecessary works.  If such thinking were engaged in, the environment would not be disrupted to the same extent.Fine Gael welcomes the introduction of the Bill.  We look forward to Bord Gáis continuing to develop its network in the coming years.  Security of supply is vital for the economy and from the point of view of infrastructure.  It is also important that there be competition, which can only be of benefit to everyone.  Based on the outcome of its investments since the previous increase in 2002, when it was allowed to borrow up to €1.7 billion, Bord Gáis will now be in a position to borrow up to €3 billion.  That is a positive development.  If the concerns I raised in respect of ensuring taxpayers' money is safeguarded and other matters are addressed, the Minister will find support for the Bill on this side of the House.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I warmly welcome the Bill.  It is particularly welcome at a time when recession, job losses and a contraction in business activity are affecting so many other areas of the economy.  The Bill is designed to enable Bord Gáis to increase its borrowing capability to €3 billion.  I hope the banking system will be able to oblige the company.  As everyone is aware, the banks are in quite a sorry state at present.  Bord Gáis is a State company and is taking on the job of the further development of an essential part of our infrastructure in the form of exactly the kind of investment that is required at present.  It is to the credit of Bord Gáis that this Bill has been introduced.In the recent budget, the Government did not provide an economic stimulus in order to ensure that people would remain in work rather than ending up on the dole.  Even though the IMF has argued in favour of the provision of such a stimulus — countries such as the US and the UK have already taken action in this regard — all we have had are cutbacks and people claiming the dole who never expected to be obliged to do so.The investment to which the Bill will give rise, which is being overseen and safeguarded by the State and the Government, is extremely important.  I welcome that investment on behalf of the Labour Party because it represents good news.  Energy security and sustainability are the major challenges we face.  If one considers what is happening in the area of electricity generation, the ESB is to be commended on the major step it took in committing to a magnificent shift towards renewables.  The Government recently raised targets in this regard to 40% by 2020.  I have some concerns in that regard, even though I support what has been done.  While the ESB is expected to reach incredible heights, I am concerned that the same demands are not being made in respect of areas, such as transport and agriculture, that give rise to high carbon dioxide emissions.  The danger is that those organisations that are progressive will be obliged to carry an undue burden in respect of our commitments on climate change.In the case of gas, the issue of energy security certainly arises.  It is a feature of our increased reliance on gas, coupled with an absence of sufficient domestic reserves.  Gas and electricity prices have skyrocketed and thousands of people are struggling to pay their bills.  In 2006, natural gas accounted for a 12% share of total fuel consumption.  It remains the dominant fuel in electricity generation.  It is clear that investment in gas infrastructure is needed and should be progressed.The issue of security of supply is central when discussing matters relating to gas.  Some 90% of Ireland's requirement is sourced in the UK.  Import dependency has grown in the past decade and all the figures illustrate our over-reliance on imported gas.  We would all like to see developments designed to ensure we have an indigenous supply of gas.  However, I hope lessons can be learned in the context of what has happened in recent times.  Everyone is aware of the difficulties that occurred in respect of the Corrib gas field.  In that context, development must be carried out in a way that does not lead to open confrontation with local communities.I welcome the forum the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has established.  I hope it succeeds and I wish it well.  However, we will be obliged to await the outcome of its work.  I ask that goodwill be shown by members of the local community in order to ensure there is some opportunity for progress to be made.Most people believe the find at the Corrib gas field will lead to lower gas prices.  However, the startling evidence is that as we import less, the price of gas will increase because the same capital costs will be incurred in respect of the interconnector.  Due to the fact that Corrib gas will be sold at international market prices, we could be in the invidious position of paying more for it.  That situation appears to be untenable.In January 2008, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, welcomed a provision in section 41 of the Finance Bill, which gave effect to a new profit resource rent tax on oil and gas production.  At the time he stated:The objective behind this new tax was to boost Exchequer returns from commercial discoveries off our shores, while at the same time maintaining Ireland's attractiveness for such exploration.  Our oil and gas resources belong to the people.  It is only right that Irish people benefit significantly from the profits these resources generate.The return to the Irish people has been successfully whittled away over decades by Fianna Fáil Ministers, including former Deputy Ray Burke in 1997 and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in 1992.  Naturally, the Labour Party welcomed the change, albeit modest, introduced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, which while it did not significantly benefit the Irish people, as he claimed, did improve the tax situation somewhat, or so we thought.  The problem is that neither we nor the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Finance know if it did benefit the Irish people.I asked by way of parliamentary question what had been the return as a result of this change and was told by the Minister for Finance that he did not know because there is not within the Revenue Commissioners any information on the breakdown of revenues collected that would provide an answer to my question.  Also, the Minister of State, Deputy Power, said he had no function in the matter, which was not much of a surprise.  All of this means that despite the high glowing phrases of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, last January, nobody can tell the Irish people whether there was any benefit from the change in the Finance Act.  We need to address this issue.It was clear, from a recent presentation to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources by the Irish Offshore Operators Association, that exploration offshore from Ireland is relatively costly because of geology, the harsh deep water environment and the fact it is generally a gas prone rather than oil rich area.  These are natural limitations that will not change.  As time goes on and we face an increasing scarcity of gas and oil supplies worldwide, we can expect that interest may well increase in obtaining rights to exploit whatever potential exists in this regard.  In view of that possibility we should know, at the very least, how much revenue is or could be generated by this exploration in terms of the 25% tax already in place and the change declared by the Minister.It would not be right to speak on this Bill without referring to the cost of fuel which has been a dominant topic in terms of public discourse and debate in this House.  Petrol prices have gone through the roof and electricity and gas prices have rocketed.  Transparency in regard to prices as provided for under the EU Gas and Electricity Price Directive is a welcome step forward in assessing how well or how badly Irish customers are faring in comparison to our EU counterparts.  We have the highest overall dependency on fossil fuel.  Electricity prices to industrial and commercial customers in Ireland in the second half of 2007, according to the information now provided to us, ranged in all consumption bands from 3% to 52% above the EU average.  In the most common industrial consumption bands applicable in Ireland, electricity prices were 23% and 29% above the EU average, due in part to the high proportion of electricity generated by gas and oil.  This is a particular factor for business at a time when business is under considerable pressure owing to the recession and the banking crisis.  We must ensure that competitiveness is built-in.  This is one of the pillars of Government policy and is one that we must keep to the forefront of our minds.Another issue that arises is fuel poverty.  While businesses can benefit from having a manageable fuel bill, many people cannot manage to pay their bills.  The Minister recently announced funding for a new warmer homes scheme made up of €5 million from his Department, €5 million from Bord Gáis and €5 million from the ESB.  While this is to be welcomed, it needs to be built on.  We need much greater emphasis on insulation.  The Labour Party in the debate on the budget argued strenuously for a national insulation programme that would put many people who are out of work as a result of the downturn in the construction industry back to work.  Insulation is one of the most practical ways of ensuring a reduction in energy prices for households.  We know that right across the board our insulation levels, in particular in older houses, are far too low.Last Friday, I attended a conference on climate change in Cork.  It was well attended, with presentations from an impressive line-up of speakers who reiterated the point that we have reached the point where we simply cannot avoid the challenge.  I appreciate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, are setting out their stalls and making as much progress they can.  However, this cannot be done by them alone.  It seems to me, in particular given the economic crisis and the Government's concerns voiced elsewhere, that the challenges in every Department that need to be addressed are simply being let slip.  This is not good enough.  We cannot ignore the challenges be they in transport or agriculture.On infrastructural development, we are speaking in this regard about a fuel that is, at least, more environmentally sustainable than others upon which we are so reliant.  We need to encourage development across the board to ensure there is no longer regional divide when it comes to provision of gas supply.  We know that businesses very often locate in areas with particular infrastructure, be it water, gas, sufficient electricity supply, broadband and so on.  These are the needs of our future in terms of the creation and development of sustainable jobs.  It is to the credit of Bord Gáis that it is willing to take on that role.  Members will recall the disaster of the sale of Eircom which led to a decline in the possibilities of infrastructural development.  Bord Gáis paralleled by the ESB, another State company, is ensuring that Ireland will have muscle when it comes to developing our capability to compete and in regard to security of supply, which at the moment we do not have in terms of storage or resources.  These are considerations which must be at the forefront of our minds.I welcome the Bill.  I do not expect anybody will have any major problems with it.  I wish it well and hope we will find a resolution, in terms of the form the Minister has established with regard to the Corrib find, that can become a template for other finds into the future.  If we do not learn from that experience, we are in danger of repeating our mistakes, which I do not believe anybody wants at this stage when energy is such a central part of our future and that of the planet which is dependant on us succeeding in reducing significantly our carbon emissions.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I am pleased to introduce this motion on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Fine Gael felt compelled to take this action due to the Government's incredibly apathetic and half-hearted response to an escalating gangland crisis.Following Shane Geoghegan's brutal murder, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided to hold a meeting with the Garda Commissioner.  Some vague reassurances were given that all was in order in regard to resources and legislation and then it was back to business as usual.  In the face of public uproar about the grotesque behaviour of gangland criminals in terrorising their neighbourhoods and plying their evil trade, the Minister belatedly promised some action.  This action culminated with today's publication of the covert surveillance Bill, which was promised more than one year ago.  While welcome, this Bill is not sufficient to deal with what we have seen in Limerick and elsewhere over the past several years.  It is regrettable the Taoiseach or the Minister did not think it appropriate to visit Limerick last week, while it was still in shock.  I note, however, that the Taoiseach is in Limerick tonight, and I wish Munster well in its rugby match.The half-hearted measures announced by the Minister are similar to the promises made following the deaths of Donna Cleary, Anthony Campbell, Seán Poland, Brian Fitzgerald and every other innocent person slaughtered by criminal gangsters in this State.  There have been 130 gangland murders in the past ten years.  Unlike the rainbow Government's ground-breaking initiative in establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996, a hands-off approach has characterised Fianna Fáil's response to escalating murder rates and a State awash with drugs.I pointed out last week that something rotten lies at the heart of the criminal justice system.  A cursory glance at the number of bench warrants that remain outstanding confirms this appraisal.  A number of serious criminals continue to ply their trade while bench warrants for their arrest are yet to be acted upon.  It is significant that Mr. Gerard Dundon, a leading member of the gang thought to be responsible for the death of Shane Geoghegan, turned himself in to police custody last week.  A bench warrant was issued for his arrest but it had not been executed.  One can still view pictures on the Internet of Mr. Dundon enjoying Hallowe'en festivities when he should have been in prison.  Mr. Dundon turned himself in because he was worried about his welfare and, now that it suits him, is availing of the protection of the State.  The man thought to have been responsible for the murder of Donna Cleary had no fewer than two bench warrants out for his arrest when he perpetrated his vile act of shooting her dead.  These people are laughing at the State's ineptitude in ensuring that criminals pay for their crimes.  What is the Minister doing about it?  Has he investigated why an outrageous number of bench warrants remain outstanding?  What is standing in the way of their execution and what does he propose to do about this fiasco?  Urgent action must be taken before more innocent people lose their lives.The criminals who are arrested are generally released on bail into the community.  The Department's own figures indicate that the number of offences committed by suspects released on bail has risen by 60% in four years, from 15,531 in 2004 to 25,097 in 2007.  The provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2007 which provide for the electronic tagging of suspects released on bail have not yet been commenced.  This is yet another dysfunction which is completely ignored by the Minister.I have often remarked in this House that gardaí are forced to fight crime with their hands tied behind their backs because of the pathetic failure of the Government to provide vital resources and equipment.  Ten years after it was promised, digital radio is still not widely available to the emergency services.  They are forced to rely on analogue, which is unreliable and easily intercepted.  In short, it is a danger to the lives of gardaí.  The Government has allowed two identical pilot projects to be implemented yet gardaí around the country are forced to rely on their own mobile phones to communicate with colleagues.  In the meantime, gangland criminals drive around in bullet proof, top of the range vehicles and live in houses with as much security as bank vaults.  As recent reports reveal, many of these houses have been paid for by the taxpayer.Our remarkably low conviction rate for gangland murder is a source of great shame for this country.  In failing to prosecute murderers, the State is failing victims, their families and civic society.  Of the 130 gangland murders that have taken place since 1998, only 14 convictions have been secured to date.  What is the reason for this unacceptably low conviction rate and what has the Minister done about it?  Thus far, the only action he appears to have taken is to slash funding for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At a time when the DPP's workload is growing at 6% per annum, its budget is to be cut by 3%.  The DPP himself has indicated that such a cutback will hamper his office's efforts to investigate the growing number of files coming across his desk.  The only action this Minister has taken in respect of conviction rates was to introduce a budget cut to the DPP.One of the most obvious weaknesses in securing convictions relates to evidence.  Last year, new laws were introduced allowing inferences to be drawn when suspects invoked their right to silence but the Minister has failed to introduce new regulations on the type of cautions to be used by gardaí in this context.  Consequently, gardaí are nervous about using these new provisions in case a trial is undermined.  There is no excuse for this inaction and the Minister must address this gross oversight as a matter of great urgency.  Why have no regulations been brought to accompany the changes made by the former Minister, Michael McDowell, to the right to silence and the inferences that can be drawn?  This failure is the reason why gardaí are reluctant to use the evidence which we were told they would.Another area neglected by the Minister is the admissibility of video evidence.  When interviewing suspects, gardaí must write out each answer in long-hand.  This seriously undermines gardaí and hampers their questioning techniques.  Even though video and audio recording should have made long-hand transcription redundant many moons ago, no action been taken to ensure that video evidence is admissible in court and most Garda stations lack video or audio recording equipment.  Furthermore, some of the stations that possess the appropriate equipment are not making use of it.  The Government claims that a working group is examining the issue.  We do not want talking shops; we want action.  This gross anomaly must be addressed as a matter of the greatest urgency.For the few brutal murderers who are convicted, there is a bright light at the end of a short tunnel.  They are highly unlikely to serve the mandatory life sentence these Houses have enshrined in legislation.  Moreover, irrespective of what they have done on the outside or what they will do on the inside, they will be rewarded with the automatic remission of up to a quarter of their sentences.  Even as this fiasco continues, the Government's commitment to establish a judicial sentencing committee constitutes another unfulfilled promise.  We do not even possess a central sentencing database that might offer judges some guidelines on sentencing.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether he has lifted a finger to deal with this grave problem or if he has seen evidence of his predecessor's fingerprints on a file.

The Houses of the Oireachtas enacted legislation in respect of mandatory sentencing and if that legislation is being flouted, the Minister must take action.For those criminals who are incarcerated, prison is not always an obstacle to criminality.  Time and again it has been shown that criminals are able to continue to run their gangland empires from inside our prisons.  Almost 1,500 mobile phones were confiscated in prisons during the first eight months of this year.  Vague promises have been made about introducing signal blocking technology to all prisons but what is happening in the meantime?  I would like the Minister to inform the House how these phones get into prisons in the first place.  It is simply not good enough.  I ask him to spell out the reason why he has not introduced a ban on mobile phones in Portlaoise prison while we await this technology. Certain categories of people can bring in their mobile phones with impunity.  They are not even checked coming out to verify whether they still have the phone or the SIM card.  Chances are that if they have the phone the SIM card is inside but they might not even have the phone.Rehabilitation within prisons is non-existent.  Many people leave prison having become more adept at criminality rather than having turned away from it.  What minor rehabilitation and education programmes existed in prisons have become victims of the latest budget.  Some people might scoff at the idea of rehabilitation, but in the context of habitual criminality with recidivism rates hitting almost 50% for ex-offenders four years after their release and at a cost of almost €100,000 per prisoner per annum to incarcerate an offender, rehabilitation is something that we need to take very seriously indeed.  Our prisons are full to capacity.  As we speak we have more prisoners behind bars than ever before yet the recidivism rate indicates that prisons are failing.  Thornton Hall, the Government's great white hope and the justification why so little has been done with existing prisons, is in a state of limbo.  The scandal of our prisons is another slur on the Minister's poor record.This week the Garda Commissioner highlighted an absence of legislation relating to surveillance of criminals as a major stumbling block.  Gardaí use covert surveillance when tackling gangland crime but the material they gather remains inadmissible in criminal trials.  While I welcome what the Minister has said this evening, we know why he said it.  If it had not been for the events of the past ten days he would not have been in Buswell's Hotel.

I encourage him to introduce this because his foot-dragging excuse that the proposed legislation is complex is unacceptable.  The Minister and his Department have access to the finest legal minds in the country when drafting legislation and this legislation should be in place by now.  Given the Garda Commissioner's full support for the proposed legislation, why has the Minister taken so long to deliver even the heads of a Bill?Another neglected area on the basis of so-called "complexity" relates to the establishment of a DNA database.  This was promised by former Minister, then Deputy McDowell in 2006 but we still do not have a draft Bill.  Ireland is therefore at a significant disadvantage compared with other countries in solving crime.  The witness protection programme is an abject failure yet alternative measures such as identity parades are at the research stage after more than ten years of Fianna Fáil in government and 130 murders.  When does the Minister propose to take action to address the major dysfunction afflicting the witness protection programme and associated measures?The State's inability to transpose the third EU money-laundering directive again allows people on the international stage to claim that Ireland's law lags behind other European jurisdictions and the United States of America.  Why have we not introduced this vital legislation in the area of money laundering?  We all know of the association between money laundering, drugs, gangland criminals and death.John Fitzgerald, as the man responsible for the regeneration of Limerick and a man for whom I have considerable respect, is more familiar with its problems than most.  He has appealed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for additional gardaí to facilitate having a high-visibility presence in at-risk communities.  He has asked for a well resourced branch of the Criminal Assets Bureau to be established in Limerick.  So far this has not happened.  How can the Government justify the extraordinary outlay of taxpayers' money being pumped into the regeneration of Limerick city while, at the same time, relatively small amounts of money to increase community Garda visibility in gang-stricken areas are not forthcoming?  The Limerick regeneration is a multi-billion euro project yet we are not putting together the minor but fundamental pieces of the jigsaw.In the meantime, this week the Garda Commissioner informed the Committee of Public Accounts — I hope to see him appear before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights soon — that, at any one time, up to 700 gardaí are tied up in court duties.  This accounts for 5% of the force and costs the State more than €10 million per annum.  The Government has failed to deliver on the post of court presenter and this situation is likely to deteriorate further.  The DPP has indicated that cuts to his budget mean that his office will have to hand back the responsibility for prosecuting cases in the District Court to the Garda, which will not help the administration of justice.  Thus the total and utter absence of joined-up thinking makes itself felt again.This brings me to my final point relating to drugs.  Criminal gangs would not prosper in this country if they did not have easy access to drugs.  The Government likes to point the finger at Foxrock and abdicate its own responsibility in this regard.  However, the bottom line is that Ireland is internationally seen as a soft touch when it comes to the importation of drugs.  With one Customs boat, one mobile X-ray scanner and a handful of sniffer dogs, this is no surprise.  Our smaller and private airports and our vast unpoliced coastline constitute a drug smuggler's paradise.  While this gross oversight remains, criminal gangs will prosper, innocent victims will be murdered and the Government will have failed the people of Ireland.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I express my deepest sympathy to the family of Shane Geoghegan.  His murder is one of the most senseless and futile deaths in a long history of this State's failure to deal with organised crime.  It is a failure of legislation, courts, policing and society.  Most of all it is a failure of Government and particularly the Fianna Fáil-led Governments that have been in power for the best part of 12 years.  On all these levels we need to attack and hold to account the criminals who are responsible for this behaviour.The conviction rates for gangland criminality have been set out before by Deputy Charles Flanagan.  However, I wish to highlight some of them.  There have been 130 gangland murders in the past 11 years but only 14 convictions.  Not a single person has been charged in the 16 gang-related murders that have taken place since 2003.  That is a damning indictment of the Government and our so-called justice system.  It illustrates in particular a failure of the system to deal with gangland criminals where gang bosses murder and maim with impunity.  The Government has clearly failed to respond in any meaningful way.  Over the course of the past week the Minister has said he is pretty much satisfied with the status quo.  He was happy with his talks with the Garda Commissioner and does not plan any fundamental changes.  This is simply not good enough.  The Garda Commissioner does not run the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and is not responsible for finding solutions to these problems.  The Minister may try to pass the buck but the buck stops with him.  He is the Minister who must find a solution to this appalling situation.  He must respond to this crisis in the same way that Fine Gael did when we were in government during the rainbow coalition.The new legislation announced today is simply inadequate and does not go far enough.  Allowing gardaí to bug buildings, vehicles etc. is not a solution to the kind of endemic systematic drug-related gangland crime we are experiencing.  We need creative solutions to tackle these unprecedented levels of criminality.  I am not just talking about new legislation, which is not adequate without the political will driven by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to utilise that legislation.  We have seen rafts of legislation in recent years which have simply been ineffectual.  I point to the mandatory sentencing introduced for drug-related offences.  Those mandatory sentences are just being ignored by the courts and are not being imposed.  They essentially allow the entire justice system to be made a mockery of.We need new criminal laws that will be implemented and which will have an effect in dealing with these gang leaders.  I fundamentally believe that we now need preventive measures so that these criminals can be taken off the streets before they murder innocent young people with their entire lives laid out before them.  This model should be based on the Offences against the State Act 1988, creating a new offence of organised gangland crime.  We must see use of the Special Criminal Court and lengthy minimum sentences of between 20 and 25 years to really deal with these people, punish the offences and create a deterrent to being a leader of a gang in this State.  We must prevent these types of criminals from committing the type of murder we have seen over the past number of years.I am tired of hearing about the rights of criminals and that we must tip-toe around them.  I am sick of the politically correct brigade, which seems to be running the show in this country.  The Minister must stand up to it, as it is about balancing the rights of the individual against the rights, needs and interests of our society.  The Minister and his predecessors have failed to do this.It is vital our criminal justice system protects the innocent and that we are not held prisoner to the political correctness which seems to have gone mad in this country.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I compliment Deputy Flanagan on this very important motion.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on it, which calls on the Government to implement a comprehensive set of proposals to tackle serious crime in this State.  In particular, it calls on the Government to launch a co-ordinated approach to tackling organised criminal gangs.I offer my sympathy to the family and friends of the late Mr. Shane Geoghegan, whose killing is another example of a murderous attack on the citizens of this State.  What is going on in some of our cities has many of the features of a war between criminal gangs and between the gangs and society.  In some respects it looks like a war in some underdeveloped region of Africa, complete with well-armed boy soldiers.  These gangs have no regard for human life or citizens going about their daily lives and they certainly have no respect for the Government and its Executive agencies.This is a war which the Government is not winning.  Over the last few years we have seen the murders of several innocent people and many gangland criminals.  Our crime problem has grown progressively more serious and drugs continue to flood into the country, providing income for these gangs.  Having failed to make any significant inroads into their activities, the Government must now take decisive action to put them out of business.So what do we know of this war?  We know the participants on all sides, including the gangs, their leaders and their members.  In the case of the latest murder of an innocent man, the newspapers tell us that the Garda know who ordered it, who carried it out, how they did it, how they travelled to and from the crime scene, where the killers went after the murder and where they are now.  They know where these gang members were born, where they grew up, to whom they are related, with whom they associate and where they live and where they go on holidays.  The newspapers themselves, in so many words, tell that they know all this as well.  It is an absurd position, as we know virtually everything about these gang members and their activities and yet it seems this Government can do virtually nothing to stop them.If it was the case that the perpetrators of this murder were simply throwing stones at each other and an innocent bystander was hit and injured, our justice system could do something about stopping this anti-social behaviour.  Existing legislation provides a mechanism through the ASBO procedure to stop a person from behaving in a way which is causing harassment, alarm and distress to a local community or person in that community.  The Garda makes an application to the court and the ASBO is granted by a District Court judge on the balance of probabilities.  Deliberately breaching an ASBO can lead to a criminal prosecution and serious penalty.  The ASBO procedure tells the minority that disrupting and terrorising the lives of others will not be tolerated by citizens.The fact that these gangs continue to grow and expand their influence and control over local communities tells us that the Government's response to date is inadequate. We need an all-out assault on the lawlessness that blights some communities.  We need to break the power of these organised crime gangs.Mr. John Fitzgerald, the former Dublin city manager, produced a report on what needs to happen if Limerick city is to be rescued from the present cycle of violence.  He identified a long-term sociological and economic strategy and I wish the new agencies established to implement this approach every success.Mr. Fitzgerald's report has one key reservation in that before anything good can happen in Limerick, the lawlessness must end.  He states:Standard approaches to policing are simply not sufficient to cope with the nature and level of the problems being experienced, yet dealing with the serious (although relatively small in number) criminal elements operating in these areas will be fundamental to facilitating the majority of ordinary citizens trying to live their lives in peace and safety.This is the immediate problem and it must be met head on.The Government response to this latest atrocity is, so far at least, too soft and easy.  These criminal gangs represent a threat to the State and democracy and they cannot be combated effectively by laws that are designed for a normal society.  We need new and powerful well-targeted measures.  What we need now are a series of tough measures to deprive these criminals of their ability to commit future crimes.  We must focus on prevention and pre-emptive actions as much as convictions after a crime.In the case of anti-social behaviour, the ASBO procedure gives the court the power to make an open-ended order which restricts the actions and behaviour of the individual.  The court has discretion as to the nature and breadth of the conditions attached to the ASBO and it can prohibit people from using certain language or words.  I call on the Minister to take decisive action in this major crisis.

The rugby club is a large extended family and although I only played briefly with the team, I still feel attached to the ethos of Garryowen.  I can fully understand why people were so shattered following the death of Shane Geoghegan.Gangland crime in Limerick is about to spread around the region.  Very shortly, gangland crime will be prevalent in places like north Kerry, Clare, south Tipperary and other parts of the Shannon region.  The gangs in Limerick already control drug distribution in the region and control the drug distribution network in north Kerry.  It is only a matter of time, in the absence of action, before the gangs establish networks in other parts of the region.  What is currently happening in Limerick could happen in other towns in the region.  The Minister and others with responsibility must take action or there will be a major problem in the short term.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place measures to deal with what is happening in Limerick and prevent the spread of such violence throughout the region.The budget for Operation Anvil has been increased by €1 million but the overall budget next year for Garda overtime has been reduced by €28 million, leaving it at €80 million.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure the Limerick Garda division does not have to absorb its share of this overtime loss next year.  The overtime funding will have to be shared across all divisions and I ask the Minister to ensure overtime funding for Limerick will be increased if at all possible.The Minister mentioned that although the number of gardaí in Limerick has increased by 62, this is well short of the 100 personnel recommended by Mr. John Fitzgerald approximately nine months ago in a report referred to by a number of speakers.  He recommended an increase of at least 100 but the increase at this stage is only 62, which is not adequate.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the figures later.Reference has been made to the Criminal Assets Bureau's regional office targeting criminal assets in Limerick.  As I understand it, only two members of the Criminal Assets Bureau work full-time in Limerick.  Given the number of gangs with a probable total membership of up to 100, two members of the Criminal Assets Bureau is not adequate.A number of good proposals have been made by Deputy Charlie Flanagan.  I compliment him on bringing forward the motion and on being so clear on the issue.  The Minister will have our full support for the covert surveillance legislation and increased use of the Special Criminal Court.  The intimidation of juries and witnesses occurred in the past in Limerick and the situation is even worse now.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I thank Deputy Charlie Flanagan for bringing this Private Members' business to the House and for sharing time.  It is somewhat poignant that the motion comes before the House when the city that somewhat unfairly seems to be getting all the attention, namely, Limerick, which is a wonderful city, is trying to celebrate its positive side with the opening of a new stadium and at least one spectator who was looking forward to seeing the All-Blacks here again after 30 years, Shane Geoghegan, will not be there.  I was in Croke Park for the game on Sunday and the minute's silence started and ended with a round of applause that was touching for everybody who was there.We must ask why gangland crime is beating the system.  Gangland crime is motivated by profit and greed and is based on utter ruthlessness.  The new breed of criminal does not have any moral conscience.  Taking a life is no more than putting out a candle.  The criminals will do anything to protect the huge profits they can make in their industry.  In the meantime, the Garda Síochána, the security forces and the Prison Service is hamstrung by working groups, study groups, reports and restricted resources.  Every day that goes by they are losing the fight with the criminals.  A bumper sticker that was popular on cars a number of years ago stated, "Crime does not pay and neither does farming".  I do not know about farming paying yet but crime certainly is paying.We do not seem to be able to put in place measures to prevent crime paying.  We have legislation, court resources, extra judges, as referred to in the amendment, but there are twice as many prisoners this year as last year out on temporary release.  Neither the criminal justice system nor prison offers a deterrent to criminals.  It is debatable whether there is even a risk to criminals in seeking the profit they can make from criminal activity.I spoke to a friend who is a Garda sergeant in Arklow, County Wicklow, following the general election 18 months ago.  He is the same age as me.  He told me he was nearly 30 years in the force.  He was measured for a stab vest six weeks previously but he said he could be retired before he gets it.  That is the way we send out the security forces to defend themselves against people who are armed to the hilt and, as Deputy Flanagan said, who drive vehicles and live in houses that are fully protected, yet we give members of the Garda stab vests in 2007.It is 11 years since the Ceann Comhairle got the justice portfolio and said he would introduce a regime of zero tolerance, a phrase for which Mayor Giuliani gets credit but it was Mayor Ed Koch who put the nuts and bolts of the system in place.  One can walk down Fifth Avenue without feeling terrorised but it is questionable whether one can do the same thing on O'Connell Street in Dublin.  My contention is that one cannot.  Words are meaningless unless they are followed with action.The Government amendment refers to deep concern at the increase in the number of licensed handguns.  If an Olympian sharpshooter with a handgun came back from the Olympics with a gold medal the Taoiseach and every Minister would be on a platform to welcome him, saying it was a great sport and gave people an outlet that is safe and secure.  We are muddying the waters by trying to blame legally held handguns for the current problems.  There is no proven correlation between the number of licensed handguns with bona fide sporting organisations and the increase in gun crime.  Let us tackle the illegal guns in the country.

It is timely that we discuss the matter.  I came to the conclusion a long time ago that crime is a growth industry in the country at present.  It is prospering all the time.  It is becoming more beneficial to be a member of a crime gang than any other industry.  The procedures we have to tackle the situation at present are laughable.  For example, there is no difficulty in people who are out on bail for serious crimes committing further serious crimes and being granted bail again.  In God's name, what are we at?  Does the Minister not realise what is happening in this country?  Surely he or someone in his Department should be able to take some initiative.  Somebody must be able to do something.  Why would the gardaí take action?  After all, if they bring the criminals before the courts they get out on bail even if they shot somebody or beat them half to death.  What do they do next?  They do the same thing to somebody else.  The Garda must be totally and absolutely brassed off at attempting to enforce the law when the will is not there to do it.  I do not want to hear nonsense about a decision of the Supreme Court in 1965 or 1966.  That is a long time ago.  That was then and this is now.  We have to deal with the situation that presents or else society will be under serious threat.I attended a meeting in Brussels recently which was addressed by the heads of Europol and Eurojust.  They said they got their information from the press.  They had to go to journalists for information.  That indicates the swapping of information between jurisdictions is not what it should be and that points to a serious deficit.  Reference has been made previously to legislation but nothing seems to be done about it.  There is no serious intent about getting to grips with the criminal fraternity.The intimidation of witnesses is another problem.  We have seen countless instances of that in recent years and it is getting worse.  Various timid intentions have been expressed to tackle it but nothing has happened and the problem continues.  When a person is charged with a crime and witnesses are interviewed they invariably agree to give evidence but after a couple of weeks they change their minds, say they were wrong or they lied the first time.  What is going on?  The Minister cannot enforce justice with that kind of situation and he cannot protect society.  The Minister is not protecting society.  It may not be all the fault of the Minister but he should remember he is in charge now and he must accept responsibility.  There is no good in saying he inherited something or referring to his predecessor's predecessor.The Minister's predecessor but one closed two prisons, Spike Island and the Curragh.  We were told at the time there was no necessity for them, that everything was under control.  We were told dying wasps were administering stings at the time and we could rest assured that everything was in order.  The criminal fraternity is laughing about the Minister, this House, the courts and the people who try to do anything to uphold law and order in the country.  That is appalling and a terrible indictment of society and the Government.  An event will occur that will crystallise the seriousness of the problem.  Gangland crime has been occurring for far too long and the Minister should do something about it before it is too late.

andnotes the increase in the number of posts in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions following a review in 2006 of staffing in the office.It is difficult to listen to the speakers opposite.  They are speaking with their tongues firmly in their cheeks when giving out about cuts and the Government's response regarding the budget.  The cut in my Department was 2.45%.  Had we adopted the Fine Gael proposal, published in its budget document issued just before the budget, we would have made a cut of 5.5% across all Departments.  We want a little honesty in this debate.I welcome the opportunity to discuss one of the gravest issues we face, the threat posed by criminal gangs to our very way of life.  That said, the Fine Gael motion is selective in failing to recognise what has been done by the House, the Government and previous Governments.  In particular, however inadvertently or thoughtlessly, it sells short the achievements of An Garda Síochána, whose members, day in, day out, are called upon to put their lives at risk in their efforts to thwart the activities of gangs.  It is because of those efforts that many gang members who may have considered themselves untouchable are behind bars facing long sentences, for which I can assure the House there will be no mitigation.  I pledge on behalf of the Government that all resources of the State will be used in our unstinting endeavours to ensure there will be no hiding place for those who engage in gangland activities.  That is no empty formula.Let me inform the House of important developments regarding the use of multi-agency checkpoints in the fight against criminal gangs.  For some years, An Garda Síochána and other State enforcement agencies have piloted multi-agency checkpoints.  As Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs between 1997 and 2002, I was a strong advocate of multi-agency checkpoints, so much so that Members of the Opposition raised problems therewith.  Following my discussions with the Garda Commissioner, An Garda Síochána and the other relevant State agencies are to begin a renewed and extended programme in respect of multi-agency checkpoints with the aim of applying relentless pressure on every front to gangs and their criminal enterprises.  Those checkpoints will include gardaí from the traffic corps and other specialist units of An Garda Síochána and staff from other State agencies, including customs officials and staff from the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I know and hope Members on all sides of the House will support the measures necessary to deal with the menace of gangland crime.It is a matter of record that strong words of some Members in the House in the immediate aftermath of an outrage were unfortunately not matched by a willingness to support tough legislative measures that were brought in to deal with it.  Their initial outrage melted away into vacillation.  It is not enough to talk tough about crime.  We must, in a clear-headed, steady and determined way, adopt the tough measures that are needed.  One should make no mistake that the fight against those involved in gangland activities will be long and must be waged relentlessly.  There will be setbacks but the Garda needs to know we offer it more than fair-weather support.  We are behind it 100% in this fight.  If the intensive measures it adopts within the law to deal with this menace are portrayed by those affected as some sort of infringement of their rights, so be it.  It is particularly sickening that those who shout most about their rights are those who have no respect at all for the lives of others, let alone their rights.We live in a State that is founded on the rule of law.  To deviate from that would be to hand a bitter victory to those who have no respect of any kind for the law.  This State has, within the rule of law, faced down challenges and will do so again, using whatever resources are necessary for however long it takes.I will not detain the House with an analysis of the current circumstances, other than to note that the activities of paramilitary organisations in this jurisdiction did much to bring about a gun culture.  It is ironic that those who often presented themselves as protectors of communities from the ravages of drug abuse in many ways opened a Pandora's box that left us with the armed gangs we must deal with today.There is no doubt some of the gangland killings arise in the wake of Garda activity directed against the gangs involved.  That activity has led to circumstances in which gang members have sought retribution against other gang members as a result of the Garda's success.  Such killings are, of course, to be deplored.  However, the Garda cannot, and will not, be deflected from taking every possible action against gangs just because the aforesaid danger exists.We should not, in the welter of public debate, lose sight of one central fact, namely, the people responsible for the brutal death of Shane Geoghegan and others were the savage killers who gunned them down, not anybody else.  What is of most importance now is that we deploy every resource in bringing those killers to justice.  That is exactly what is being done and what will continue to be done.  I emphasise this point on a night on which Shane Geoghegan's mother and others close to him are bravely coming forward to appeal to the public to help find his killers, an appeal we in this House all resoundingly endorse.The Government and its two predecessors have extensively reformed criminal law, and we fully intend to continue doing so.  Many of the reforms are targeted at the fight against gangland crime.  The criminal justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide-ranging initiatives to strengthen the capacity of the Garda to tackle serious crime.  While I do not intend to list every reform, I want to highlight some of the most far-reaching ones.  In cases of offences connected with organised crime, such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of firearms or explosives, detention of up to seven days is now possible.  This measure was opposed by parties on the opposite side of the House when it was introduced in 2007.  Our bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, opinion evidence from a chief superintendent that bail should be refused because the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence is now admissible.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect's silence in response to Garda questioning have been expanded.As with all such reforms, it takes time for their impact to be seen in criminal trials.  It is naive to believe measures we enact in the House one day will immediately transform circumstances the next.  However, we have recently begun to see clear evidence that the reforms are working.  For example, as Deputy Durkan is aware, the figures for 2007 show a doubling in the number of mandatory minimum sentences of ten years handed down by the courts in drug trafficking cases compared with the figures for 2006.  We have noted the provisions allowing for witness statements that a witness fails to stand over or recants to be used in evidence, thus helping to secure a conviction.  This occurred to great success in a recent trial on foot of which an offender was put away for a considerable period.  In this case, 11 witnesses were either unwilling to make a statement or recanted statements they had made previously.  The changes we made in the legislation of 2007 meant we were able to accept the original witness statements.  A positive ruling has been handed down by the courts in respect of the provisions on the drawing of inferences, including in respect of the right to silence.We will continue to press forward with the work of strengthening the criminal law.  Work is ongoing on the criminal justice (forensic evidence and sampling) Bill, which will provide for the establishment of a DNA database for criminal investigation.  Such a database will, as has been the experience in other countries, greatly enhance the intelligence available to the Garda Síochána.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill early in the new year.  I have already made provision in next year's Estimates for my Department for an €18 million funding package for a new state-of-the-art forensic science facility and State pathology laboratory.  This will enable the work on the DNA database to proceed once the legislation is in place.My proposals for a criminal justice (covert surveillance) Bill were considered for approval by the Government at the Cabinet meeting today, and I have published the general scheme.  The Bill will make it possible for intelligence gained through secret surveillance to be used in evidence for the prosecution of cases of serious criminal activity.  In light of the increasing sophistication of criminals, subversives and terrorists, their use of intermediaries and the associated difficulties in obtaining direct evidence, the use of additional evidence is crucially important.  The Bill will provide for a system of authorisations for covert surveillance operations which, as a rule, will involve an application to a judge for authorisation to proceed with the surveillance.  The reasons for the surveillance will be clearly set out before the court.  The Bill also provides that in cases of exceptional urgency a senior member of An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces may approve a surveillance operation for a period of no more than 14 days.Work is ongoing in the preparation of the general scheme of the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009.  Although this Bill is primarily aimed at giving effect to the legislative aspects of the justice for victims initiative that I announced in June, some elements of it will be of considerable benefit in our fight against serious crime.  In particular, I am thinking of the proposal that will enable the DPP to seek a retrial where an acquittal is tainted due, for example, to intimidation of witnesses or jurors.  There will also be a provision on expert evidence, to ensure that the prosecution is given adequate opportunity to examine and challenge evidence introduced by the defence.  In other words, there will be a levelling of the pitch.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for the drafting of this Bill in December with a view to its publication in the spring.I note Deputy Flanagan's intention to bring forward a criminal justice Bill which deals mainly with sentences and remission.  In line with the programme for Government I have the matter of remission under consideration.  However, I would not like persons to delude themselves that remission is an issue in respect of convictions for murder.  There is no remission on life sentences which are mandatory in the case of murder.  The current position is that anyone sentenced to life imprisonment can be kept in prison for life.

We have never released any person involved in organised crime convicted of murder and there are prisoners who have been in prison over 30 years.  Introducing a tariff of 25 years might act to prevent a Minister detaining someone for longer than 25 years, because a decision to detain someone longer than the 25 year tariff imposed by a court would lead to judicial review.  The 25% remission applying to fixed sentences has been operating here for over 100 years, and the courts are undoubtedly aware of it in imposing sentences.  Obviously, a judge discounts the 25 years when he or she imposes sentence.  What would be achieved by abolishing remission when the courts would, in consequence, impose lower sentences?  I also doubt that changes could be made in respect of existing sentences which have been imposed by the courts under the existing system.I shall look at what this Bill has to say about civil restrictions on persons involved in organised criminal activity.  However, such restrictions would be very weak compared to the offences gangs commit.  I do not think it would be sensible to divert Garda resources from their work to ensure that gang members are locked away for a very long time.I shall consider the detail of the Bill, but I have warned the House before of the dangers of legislative acts of delusion, particularly ones that, however well intentioned, could actually worsen the situation, as is the case with Deputy Flanagan's suggestion of 25 year sentences.

I will not detail the resources which are being provided to the Garda, as these are set out comprehensively in the Government's amendment to the motion.  My intention was to list everything in order to show exactly what has been done.The amendment reflects the fact that in deciding on the Estimates for my Department this year I directed that absolute priority be given to the fight against crime.  This matter arose during Question Time the other day.  Three months ago, I said that I wanted to concentrate on crime, given the fact that I would have fewer resources next year.  I had to earmark the issue of tackling crime and dealing with our prisons and that is exactly as it has emerged. The Fine Gael 5% cut would mean that we would have to cut the programme for the Criminal Assets Bureau.  We increased the resources for the CAB by 20% and also increased and ring-fenced the money for Operation Anvil, which is directed at organised crime.The attested strength of An Garda Síochána will increase to almost 14,900 by the end of 2009 from its current attested strength of 14,267.  This increase in the number of gardaí, together with the flexibility that overtime gives to the force, will ensure delivery of a real sustainable increase in visible policing in all our communities.  Along with the increase in civilian numbers in An Garda Síochána of 20% since the start of this year, and the increase of 60% in the past 21 months, such numbers will more than offset the planned reduction in overtime.  A ring-fenced allocation of €21 million, an increase of €1 million, will enable Operation Anvil to continue in 2009 with the targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.We cannot overlook the fact that the demand for drugs is the lifeblood of many criminal gangs in this country.  Any person, from whatever class or background, who uses illicit drugs is not well placed to deplore the activities of gangs.  Such persons are complicit in those activities.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John Curran, is currently drawing up the national drugs strategy for the next eight years.  I have no doubt that we will debate that strategy fully in this House when it is presented.  I reject completely suggestions that have been made from time to time, even recently, that the answer is to legalise drugs.  That completely overlooks the harm that comes from drug abuse and would hand victory to the purveyors of death and destruction.The Criminal Assets Bureau has been highly successful over the past 12 years in tackling the criminals in a very effective and tangible way.  It demonstrates the effectiveness of the co-ordinated multi-agency approach in dealing with the proceeds of crime.  I acknowledge that the bureau had its origins in proposals put forward at the time by the current Ceann Comhairle.  It represents a new form of policing designed to disrupt and disable the capacity of targeted individuals to participate in further criminal activity.  Work at the bureau continues to evolve in response to the changing environment.  There was a significant increase in the number of trained asset profilers in 2008, ensuring that CAB has a presence in every part of the country.  An incorrect reference was made stating that there were only two full-time CAB personnel in Limerick.  That is not the case.  There are more personnel in Limerick from the CAB than there are anywhere else.  There are two profilers in the city, the same number provided for most other counties.The bureau is now looking at middle-ranking criminals as well as their bosses.  These persons are often well known as drug dealers in their local areas and are a constant provocation for parents and community workers who are doing their best to protect their youth and keep their local community safe.In any criminal system there is an inevitable time lapse between the issuing of a warrant and its execution but I am assured that the Garda will continue to prioritise the enforcement of warrants, of whatever kind, against those involved in serious crime.  A serious effort was made during August of this year to deal with the backlog of warrants.  The vast majority of warrants relate to monetary penalties.  I am taking all the steps open to me to reduce the burden on gardaí, in particular through outsourcing the collection of fines.  This is a priority in my Department.  We heard time and time again in this House that there were too many gardaí sitting behind desks.  Today 2,600 civilians are working with the 14,200 gardaí who can thereby be released from desk duties.I will address the issue of the collection of fines in a fines Bill which I will bring forward——

I fully support the comments which the Garda Commissioner made at the Committee of Public Accounts last week about licensed handguns.  The Commissioner acknowledged at the meeting that I have raised this matter with him on many occasions over the past number of months.  Since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have made clear my concern at the number and type of handguns being licensed.  That is why, at my direction, my Department and the Garda Síochána have engaged in an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law.  That review is now in its final stages.  In addition, work is well under way on the preparation of a criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which, among other things, will give effect to the proposals emerging from that review.I do not believe we can countenance a proliferation of handguns as a matter of public policy.  I raised this issue with my Cabinet colleagues this morning and they agreed with my assessment.  I recognise that the vast majority of handgun owners are responsible people, but my concern is the safety of the public, particularly at a time of concern about gun crime.  I accept what Deputies have said about sports people.  Do we want to go down the road of America, Finland and other countries where there is a proliferation of handguns?  Until 2004, handguns were completely banned in Ireland but the position changed as a result of a court case, rather than any measures taken in the House.  I will make a detailed statement on this matter in the near future.  I will record now that in light of the Troubles all handguns were banned in this jurisdiction from the early 1970s until a few years ago.  Following a series of judicial decisions that is no longer the case.  No public policy decision was made to bring about this situation.The Criminal Justice Act 2006 made a number of changes strengthening our firearms code.  One of the purposes of the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be to make a number of technical changes which are necessary to ensure that some of those changes can be brought into operation effectively.  However, in light of the situation we face, I do not believe these measures on their own will be sufficient and I will go further.I am conscious, as should be other Deputies, of the remarks made by Mr. Justice Charleton in a recent judgment in a firearms case in which he stated he was surprised the Oireachtas had not addressed the issue of firearms.  Remarks on the issue made by a number of Deputies on the other side reflect my concerns.  The increasing prevalence of handguns has not come about as a result of any deliberate policy decision by the Government or the House.  This situation is clearly unsatisfactory and I will bring forward effective proposals to deal comprehensively with the issue.There is no excuse for the type of gangland activities we have witnessed.  Members of gangs bear complete personal responsibility for their deeds.  It is not a contradiction to point out that in the longer term we risk condemning future generations if we do not face up to the deep-seated social problems which have beset parts of Limerick.  In recognition of this my Department was instrumental in initiating and supporting the Limerick regeneration project led by Mr. John Fitzgerald.  The Secretary General of my Department was in Limerick today making a presentation to the board of the regeneration project.I do not stand before the House to claim our criminal justice system is perfect and does not need change.  For my part, I pledge, as Minister, to keep under constant and intensive review all aspects of the operation of the criminal justice system and continue to bring forward whatever changes are sensible and required.  However, it serves only to demoralise those in the front line who have to face down the evil doers in our midst not to recognise what has been achieved to date.  It is against that background that I commend the amendment to the House.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Like every other Member of the Oireachtas, I was shocked to learn of the recent senseless death of Shane Geoghegan.  The death of this innocent young man who had contributed so much to his community has had a dramatic impact not only on Limerick but on the entire country.  The sight of so many Garryowen jerseys in the crowd at last weekend's rugby international showed the high esteem in which Mr. Geoghegan was held and that his death affected many people.  It is sad to note that as this debate takes place, Shane Geoghegan should have been in Thomond Park with his friends and club mates enjoying the Munster versus New Zealand match.  I, too, extend my deepest sympathy to Shane's family and friends on their loss.Unfortunately, we must accept that we live in an increasingly violent society.  Respect for and fear of law and order is a thing of the past for some.  Today's criminals are, as we have seen, sometimes lethal and show no respect for life.  They are legally savvy and usually repeat offenders.  Regardless of interventions by any number of agencies, these individuals will end up in trouble.  Simplistic as it may sound, perhaps some people are unfortunately bad and beyond redemption and must be jailed.I look forward to the earliest possible introduction and enactment of a number of Bills addressing justice issues.  Members of the public expect the House to be hard on crime.  The time for talking is over and the Government is committed to acting.  Last week, I listened with dismay to the parents of the late Donna Cleary relate on a radio programme the shocking position in which they find themselves.Last week, a delegation from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  I noted with interest that the ICCL, in its report, Taking Liberties, took issue with four aspects of the report by the review group on balance in the criminal law.  I support the changes proposed by the review group, particularly on the right to silence; the inference of guilt by staying silent; character evidence; the exclusionary rule; and "with prejudice" and fresh evidence appeals.  In the case of character evidence, the proposal would give the courts the power to question an accused person about previous convictions, which would be an important development.  In the case of the exclusionary rule, the change would allow evidence to be put before a jury, even where it has been collected in a questionable manner.  These proposals are of vital importance if we are serious about tackling gangland crime.All of us accept that gangland activity is escalating.  It is difficult to control gunmen who are prepared to hide in the dark with a gun at their side, ready to shoot an innocent victim.  We are also aware of the difficulty in providing security in other areas, for example, in preventing suicide bombers.  It is very difficult to stop someone who is determined to kill someone.  Those involved in the drugs trade are heavily funded, sophisticated and unafraid of taking risks.  In this respect, I commend the Garda and Naval Service on the recent seizure of drugs off the coast.  There is no doubt that co-operation between the Garda, police forces throughout Europe and our friends in the United States was a major factor in this success.In 2006 and 2007, the Government introduced legislation specifically targeting gangs and gang membership. New legislation, the covert surveillance Bill, the heads of which were published today, is welcome.  Garda numbers have increased to almost 15,000 and the Government has made a commitment to ongoing recruitment of 400 gardaí per annum.  The sharing of intelligence and closer co-operation among police forces throughout Europe is welcome, as was the introduction of the Garda emergency response unit in recent months.  The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to do great work and has been effective in putting gangland criminals out of business.  I welcome the increase in funding of 20% allocated to the CAB this year.A witness protection programme is in place.  Addressing the fear of the community is vital if this programme is to continue to be successful.  However, I accept there are difficulties with it in our communities.  We have also introduced new procedures to allow prosecutors to use witness statements given to gardaí in interviews when the witnesses in question subsequently retract their statements in court due to threats or intimidation.  The whole country was shocked when the trial for murder of a young Limerick man collapsed when witnesses who had identified the suspect suddenly developed collective amnesia.  This change of evidence by witnesses will not cause prosecutions to fail in future.  Just last month, a defendant was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in a trial in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court after being found guilty of a stabbing offence despite the fact that witnesses in the case had withdrawn their evidence.  This is the first court case of its type in the State in which prosecutors used their new powers.  These new procedures will lead to many of the main players in gangland crime being sent to prison where they belong.Increased penalties have been introduced for the possession of firearms under the new criminal justice Acts.  New regulations on bail will make it much easier for authorities to challenge applications for bail.  New mandatory sentencing has been introduced for repeat offenders connected with organised crime.  The 2007 Criminal Justice Act made important changes to the right to silence, following recommendations from the criminal law review group, taking recent case law and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights into account.  Although the right to silence remains, a court can now draw inferences from the failure to account for being in a particular place or the failure to account for certain marks or objects.  Courts can now also draw inference from the failure to mention certain evidence at interview stage which is subsequently raised by the defence at a trial.  These changes again strengthen the hand of Garda and prosecutors in dealing with organised criminal gangs.Legislation to establish a DNA database, to which the Fine Gael Party motion refers, is being drafted and will be presented to the House shortly.  The database, when established, will be maintained by the Forensic Science Laboratory.  It will be of particular assistance to gardaí investigating crime and will greatly increase the intelligence available to them.  The DNA profiles collected by gardaí during their investigations will be held on the database indefinitely and will be of great assistance in freeing up Garda resources by aiding with the identification of suspects and allowing innocent individuals to be eliminated early in an investigation.Limerick is one of the most heavily policed urban centres in the country, with 626 gardaí on the ground, including 90 community gardaí.  Garda numbers in the city increased by 12% in the past year and 40% in the past five years.  Closed circuit television is used extensively in the city centre, Moyross and Our Lady of Lourdes.  In addition, the area is also covered by 27 gardaí on mountain bikes while covert and overt surveillance and armed patrols take place on a 24-hour basis.  Garda emergency response units are also in place.   Organised crime is a cancer in society and is damaging many urban communities.  This Government is fully committed to fighting organised crime and putting its key players into prison.  We have introduced a comprehensive package of legislation which has an impact on the ground and is aiding the Garda in its fight against these criminals.  The Government is also committed to tackling the many social problems which afflict urban communities and that have led people into lives of crime.I commend both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the members of An Garda Síochána for the efforts they have made to date to remove organised crime from our streets. I have no doubt they will be successful in their efforts.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	450	With the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Upton and Costello.I have no doubt about Deputy Connick's sincerity when he tells the House the Government is dedicated to putting the crime bosses behind bars.  Unfortunately, it has not been particularly successful up to the present.  The Minister made his big play today in advance of this debate when he published the heads of the much promised covert surveillance Bill.  This draft surveillance Bill has featured in all of the planted stories about this since the tragedy in Limerick, on the front page of The Irish Times and so forth.  I was somewhat surprised when I looked at what the Minister had produced.  His predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, when I published the Covert Surveillance Bill on behalf of the Labour Party in November 2007, said at the time it would “alert the criminals to Garda investigative techniques”.  He implied he was speaking on behalf of the Garda Síochána.It would appear that the tragedy in Limerick has changed the mind of this Minister.  If he shakes his head this Minister will tell me he agreed with my Bill all the time and disagreed with the then Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Anyway, the Minister has published a Bill and it is entirely ambiguous, because all it appears to do is put on a statutory footing the existing powers of the Garda Síochána with regard to surveillance.  Only in exceptional circumstances may gardaí use this evidence in court.  Now that is really a three card trick, which does not advance us one whit.  If this is the Minister's big legislative shot against the crime bosses, they will not be too concerned.  The Garda Commissioner has gone out of his way to tell us he exercises these powers now, and the only difference is that he will have the legal cover to do so.  However, such evidence may not, except in exceptional circumstances, be used in court, so I do not think too much of that.The Minister said that he and two previous Governments had done the devil and all.  He stated: "Many of the reforms are targeted at the fight against gangland crime. The criminal justice acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide-ranging initiatives to strengthen the capacity of the Garda to tackle serious crime".  Well, it may have introduced them, but what——

I was watching him on television last night and some of the questions were about the time he went off to London, to maintain JMSE, and keep it stum.  He came back and said, in effect, that it had been Bertie's decision, not his.  He is always so self-exculpatory.  He should stay quiet for a minute.  I did not interrupt him.The Minister tells me the Government brought in this 2006 Act and was going to do the devil and all about organised crime.  I should like to refer him to the questions from Deputy Charles Flanagan and me on 18 November, when we asked him to detail for us the convictions secured as a result of section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  He gave us a dissertation on the CSO and told us at the end that he had requested the CSO to tell us the answer.  Now here is a man who is Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, professes to be fighting gangland crime and produces this item of legislation as one of his major weapons.  Section 72 is specifically on organised crime.  We asked a simple question as to whether it had ever been used, was it successful in the event, and how many convictions were there and he said he did not know, but the CSO might and he would direct it to tell us.

I watched the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, and it was almost beyond belief.  One would believe he was a new Fianna Fáil Opposition Deputy.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	463	What did Deputy Ó Cuív say last night when asked about the question of gangland crime, and especially the problems in Limerick?  He said, "The biggest blight in this country is bad planning".  This was from a Fianna Fáil Minister, and it is almost beyond belief.  Who is the cause of the sprawling housing estates we have built?  Then he went on to say his solution was that he would seal off the coastline.  This is the type of nonsense that has us in the situation we are in.I should like to have a great deal more time to address this.  Up to now the main focus as regards gangland killing has been the reform of the legislation and what new law might be brought forward.  Of course, ongoing reform of the law is desirable and updating the criminal law is necessary.  For example, in certain circumstances there are priorities we might address and top of the list should be the covert surveillance Bill, but not in the terms as published today by the Minister — without the Minister getting carried away about the little paragraph on FOI.  If FOI upsets him that much I shall withdraw it.The Labour Party Bill is a superior Bill.  The law should be changed, as Deputy Connick has suggested, to allow evidence to be admitted where there is a technical breach of rights.  The witness protection programme should be put on a statutory footing and the strengthening of the powers of the DPP is necessary to include appeals against acquittals on the direction of a judge.  Apart entirely from a number of legislative measures, which if I had time I could deal with, the other main limb of the fight back against the crime bosses is the enforcement of the extensive laws we have.The Minister made a fair point the last day when he said we cannot legislate away the need for evidence, and I accept that.  However, when we look at the record, the performance in respect of gun murders, for example, is very poor.  Some 22 convictions were secured in circumstances where there were 161 gun murders in the last decade.  That figure has mysteriously dropped to 159, I notice, in the reply to the most recent parliamentary question in this regard.  I do not know how that happened, but we shall leave that aside.  We ask a good deal from the gardaí at the coalface, who confront ruthless gangsters who observe none of the rules of civilised society.  It is the task of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day to ensure Garda resources are adequate and are most productively deployed.  It is not apparent that the management of Garda resources, generally, is as efficient or as effective as it might be.  Nor is it apparent that all the proposed reform of the Garda Síochána has brought about, in practice, very much change.  In reality there appears to be little commitment to genuine community policing.  Residents in huge tracts of urban Ireland are unhappy that gardaí are rarely visible in their neighbourhoods.  A senior lawyer claimed last night on television that 12 drug pushers operate with impunity adjacent to the Four Courts and near municipal headquarters.  Those of us who support the Garda are concerned at the frequency with which we hear that type of claim, while relatively harmless conduct by teenagers kicking their heels is the subject of garda caution. All of us who support the Garda will have been dispirited by the dismissive manner adopted towards the Morris tribunal in a recent editorial in the magazine of the Garda Representative Association.There is a lot of noise coming from this Government about the Taoiseach's priority of implementing public sector reform.  No institution of the State should be outside the remit of such reform.  The time has come to end the practice whereby Garda appointments above the rank of inspector are made directly by Government.  Senior appointments elsewhere throughout the public service are made by independent appointments commissions.  In the new dispensation it is important that senior Garda appointments be taken out of the domain of party politics.  This single decision would give more impetus to the dynamic for genuine change than any reforms to date which have met with mixed success.

Rinne mé iarracht leasú a chur síos agus, go bhfios dom, níl an Leas-Cheann Comhairle ag glacadh leis ag an am seo, ach b'fhéidir go mbeidh raic agam amárach faoin leasú sin.I welcome the opportunity to speak again on the issue of serious organised crime.  We addressed it last week and I will not repeat at length my contribution to the statements on the murder of Mr. Shane Geoghegan.  Many of the points I made then are reflected in the amendment I tabled on the Government amendment to the motion from Fine Gael.  They include the need for secure digital radio to be rolled out in Limerick as early as it is rolled out in Dublin.  Limerick is scheduled to receive new secure radio a year later than Dublin.There is also a need to roll out the dial to stop drug dealing confidential freefone initiative to Limerick and the rest of the State immediately, and not in the hotch-potch way it is rolled out now.  There is a need for practical witness protection and greater and faster civilianisation of the Garda to free up fully trained gardaí from behind desks to fight crime.  More funding is needed to tackle the drugs crisis.  More sniffer dogs are also required.  Delays in the justice system, including the processing of Criminal Assets Bureau cases, need to be addressed and CAB needs to focus on drug related crime.  The money confiscated should be ring-fenced for the communities worst affected by the ravages of the drugs crisis.  There is a need to reverse the budget cuts to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.I have a series of further proposals I was unable to include in my contribution last week owing to time constraints, and I have raised them previously.  Prison must become a more effectively deployed part of a sustainable response to gangland crime.  The problem of minor offenders entering the prison system and emerging at the other end as hardened criminals in league with gangs must be addressed, and to date nothing has been done to address this.  Prison sentences must be used as an opportunity to remove serious criminals from their associates and potential associates.  The placement of such prisoners must be intelligence led, and in making orders that apply post-release, judges should reinforce these efforts and aim towards maintaining the disassociation of serious senior criminals on the outside.The super-prison planned for the Thornton Hall site and whose status I do not know given the downturn and the financial problems of Mr. McNamara is a retrograde step.  Like the US model it is based on, gangs will flourish if the Minister proceeds with the project.  The prison estate must be refurbished for humanitarian reasons but expanding it substantially on one site is not the way to go.  The issues raised last month by the first report of the new Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr. Justice Michael Reilly, must be addressed.  He identified serious shortcomings in the educational facilities of our prisons.  For younger offenders, their time spent in prison must be focused on preventing them from re-offending, and this means investing more in educational facilities and supports in prisons.Regarding legislative defects, there is a urgent need for legislation governing covert surveillance which is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights, and that legislation must take heed of the criticisms of Mr. Justice Morris and others and the jurisprudence of the ECHR.  It must protect against unwarranted invasions of privacy and harassment and put in place a sound network of frameworks and thresholds through which the Garda or DPP can argue a case and seek judicial approval for the use of covert investigative techniques in serious cases.  This evidence, once gathered properly and in compliance with ECHR law, would then be admissible in court and we need movement on this from the Government.  I welcome the decision to publish it but we need to see it more quickly so we can deal with it in this House and make sure it is compliant.I urge caution on some proposals that have been floated by well-intentioned but ill-informed political representatives.  During the painful and fearful aftermath of yet another callous murder there is a temptation to dismantle the safeguards and protections all good citizens currently enjoy.  There is a temptation to demand regressive and ultimately ineffective measures such as internment, non-jury trials and mandatory sentences.  This temptation is understandable but must be resisted.The fact that criminal trials are undertaken in front of a jury is not the reason gangland criminals operate with impunity.  Juries have been proven to be more than willing to convict when a properly evidenced prosecution case is made before them.  In the absence of a jury the risk of a miscarriage of justice or the real perpetrators getting away with their crimes is substantially increased.  Mandatory sentences have been proved not to have reduced crime in other jurisdictions.  Many proposals aired at present are dangerous, short-sighted, will fail victims, and will not deliver justice or reduce serious crime.The Government must focus on tackling the drugs crisis.  Resources for Garda drug squads must be doubled at least and extra sniffer dogs and modern equipment such as secure radios for the Garda are needed.  There must be a focus on highly addictive drugs such as crystal meth and crack cocaine while continuing to focus on the major problems with heroin and cocaine.  The decision to cut the funding for local drugs task forces must be reversed and resources must be increased to reflect the growth of the drugs crisis over the past year.  In the face of a drug epidemic it is ludicrous to cut funding and curtail the activities of drugs task forces or to block or stall the work of local organisations working to prevent the spread of drugs and to facilitate rehabilitation.If we do not want further murder and community destruction, we need to get serious about tackling the drugs crisis, and we need serious investment in local drugs task forces.  As a member of my local drugs task force, I know the extent of the drugs crisis.  I know how these organisations are struggling to cope on the moneys they have currently.  They have been evaluated and found to be very effective in what they do with their moneys.  I hope the Minister has listened to what has been said in the House tonight and that he will tackle the drugs crisis.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	465	When I read the report on this matter in the newspaper yesterday I was alarmed.  I raise it not to scaremonger, but because it is our duty as public representatives and legislators to ensure confidence in our statutory agencies.  The Fine Gael Party has proposed the amalgamation or dissolution of some of the statutory agencies, but has never included the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, among these.  By definition, it is a body we need, but we must have confidence in it.There is a lack of accountability in the way the agency reports its workings to the public and public representatives.  It is not acceptable that a draft report was left on a shelf somewhere for 12 months.  We were told by the FSAI yesterday that action had been taken.  That may be the case and there may be no reason for concern with regard to any bottled water.  However, that would have been comforting to know when Galway City Council was putting boil notices in place and supplying people with bottled water.  Was the Galway City Council aware of which brands were on the list identified as being contaminated?  Is there even that level of communication between the FSAI and local authorities?The level of e.coli contamination of 6.3% compares very badly with imported water.  Is the problem that there is ground water contamination in springs that are supposed to be pure and healthy?  Why is it that still water has a much higher incidence of contamination than sparkling water?  There are questions to be answered in this regard.  The bottled water industry here was worth  €205 million last year, with approximately 38 litres per person being consumed.  Such consumption was unheard of 20 years ago.  This is a growth sector of our food industry and it would be a shame if public confidence in our water was lost.  Whenever I go to the filling station for fuel, I buy still water to have in the car.  It would be a shame if people lost confidence in this area of the food sector.The FSAI has been almost indignant about any questioning, by me or the Irish Independent, of the way it does its business.  Some years ago the Irish Blood Transfusion Service had no public representatives on its board and we lamented that fact.  I do not want to be alarmist, but the only way these agencies have of reporting to us is through all-party committees.  We need to examine the structure of these agencies and consider whether absolute independence without any political participation at board level is desirable or whether it would be better to have some level of monitoring by public representatives of each of these agencies.If our only recourse for calling them to account is through an all-party committee, we get our answers too late.  We are not involved in the day-to-day workings, but we should be more firmly involved in the way they do their business.  This incident only serves to highlight this.  It is a matter of genuine public concern that a report that highlights this level of contamination in what is seen as a pure, clean product has gone unreported for 12 months.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides us with an opportunity to outline to the House the position in this regard.The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has advised that no public health and safety implications arise from the draft report on bottled water.  The report, currently being finalised, provides an historical account of the extent of compliance with the regulations on bottled waters on sale in Ireland during the final four months of 2007.The FSAI carries out several surveys on different products on an annual basis.  During 2007, such a survey was conducted in the area of bottled water.  The report outlines the results of this survey.  During the course of these surveys, appropriate action is taken in the event of the identification of any goods not compliant with existing legislation.  Where public health is at risk, the details are made public immediately.  In this case, however, the FSAI considered that there was no risk to public health.The survey showed that a number of products were not in full compliance with the bottled water regulations.  The report gives a snapshot of bottled water on the market in 2007, where a number of samples — ten out of 952 or 1% — were detected with very low levels of e.coli.  In 99% of cases, the samples were found to be compliant.  The FSAI considers that the presence of e. coli at such levels does not pose a threat to public health.  Coliforms were found in 6.3% of bottled water samples.  These are bacteria used to assess the standards of hygiene of the water source or the bottling process.  The FSAI view is that the presence of coliforms in bottled water does not necessarily indicate a risk to consumer health.No products were deemed to have been unsafe during the course of the surveillance period.  In addition, industry measures to improve the quality of affected products were taken quickly.  The FSAI did not consider it necessary, therefore, to take stronger enforcement action.  This is in line with normal practice and proportionate to the nature of the non-compliance detected.  This is also consistent with the FSAI working to develop an Irish food safety culture of commitment rather than one of mere compliance.While the FSAI deemed that there was no threat to public health, follow-up actions were taken to ensure full compliance of all products with the bottled water regulations.  Environmental health officers conducted follow-up sampling, on an ongoing basis.  No problems were found during the first six months of 2008.  The FSAI has assured the public that there is no cause for concern about the safety of bottled waters on the Irish market.The FSAI report will be published in its entirety during the next couple of weeks when the scientific review process is complete.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I am pleased my constituency colleague, Deputy Micheál Martin, is here to address the issue, as I know he has supported the Cork docklands project since its infancy.Cork docklands represent an area of approximately 166 hectares in the middle of Cork city, with more than 4 km of waterfront.  The area includes the south and north docks.  The plan for the regeneration of the Cork docklands area provides for the development of residential units which could cater for up to 15,000 people.   Such a development would create thousands of jobs, would involve the development of an integrated transport network and a convention centre and would help to stem the recent decline in the population of Cork city.At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the work of Cork City Council and in particular that of the docklands directorate it established in recent years to promote and lead this project thus far.  In particular, I pay tribute to the leadership shown by the council's director of services, Pat Ledwidge, and the city manager Joe Gavin.  Without their work on the Cork docklands project, it would be but a pipe dream.  They published a Cork docklands development strategy in 2001, a Cork docklands economic study in 2007 and a south docks local area plan in 2008.For many years, the importance of the Cork docklands project has been recognised in local, regional and national strategy documents, including the Cork area's strategic plan, the national spatial strategy, which recognised Cork as a gateway city, and the national development plan, which recognises the importance of the Cork docklands project.  In recognition of this and of the work undertaken by Cork City Council, last year the former Taoiseach established the national steering forum for the Cork docklands project.  I understand the forum's report, which has become known as the Wrixon report as it was chaired by Professor Gerry Wrixon, was completed in recent months and has been submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The forum conducted its work in a representative fashion.  Its membership included the city and county managers, representatives of Cork Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Cork and six Departments, as well as local landowners and community representatives.  It had a broad membership and its report has been submitted to the Department recently.  However, it has yet to be published and the Minister should address the issue of when it will be published.  Elements of it have been leaked to the media and one can only assume such reports have been accurate.  For instance, they set out that the report provides for an investment by the State of up to €615 million in the years to 2020 on the construction of three bridges, three roads, public transport, water, schools and so on.  The report also is alleged to have recommended the establishment of a new body to oversee the development of the docklands during the next 20-year period and that planning control should remain with Cork City Council.There has been some debate in Cork as to whether the lead implementing agency should be Cork City Council or a national body.  I believe that notwithstanding the immense work done by the city council to date, advancing this project through the barriers and obstacles will require national input and leadership along the lines recommended by the forum report that was published.I welcome the progress that has been made to date, particularly in respect of the Minister's intention to introduce tax incentives for the SEVESO-listed sites that form part of the Cork docklands area, subject to the approval of the European Commission.  There are three such sites within the Cork docklands area and their removal would address a key barrier to the future development of the docklands area.  As the Minister is aware, the Cork docklands project is of national significance and at a time of recession in particular, it represents a not-to-be-missed opportunity for our city and region and I look forward to the Minister's reply.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	476	There is general consensus among relevant Departments and State agencies that the ambitious plan for the regeneration of the Cork docklands advanced by Cork City Council is potentially of major significance both to the city itself and in a wider national framework.With an area of more than 160 hectares contiguous to the city centre, the docklands offer the prospect of developing a modern, mixed-use city quarter.  Current plans anticipate that over a 20-year period, the population of the docklands could increase from 500 at present to approximately 22,000.  This would entail the provision of more than 9,500 residential units, including nearly 2,000 social and affordable units.  This regeneration project has the potential to sustain approximately 27,000 new jobs in retail and financial services, industry, ICT, higher-level educational institutions and leisure and cultural activities.Development on this scale is the equivalent of placing a large Irish town in a city centre location and would give Cork further critical mass in terms of its potential to act as a counterpoint to Dublin.  For this reason, the regeneration of the docklands is recognised as a priority project under the national development plan and as an important element in meeting the overall objectives of the national spatial strategy regarding balanced regional development.  Moreover, there is a clear commitment in the programme for Government to support the transformation of the area.In recognition of the potential significance of the Cork docklands project, I, on behalf of the Government, established the Cork Docklands Development Forum, comprising representatives of relevant Departments, State agencies, local authorities and business and community interests.  The forum's secretariat was based in my former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Essentially, the forum was asked to prioritise the early consideration by, and response of, public bodies to the docklands area plan and to promote the effective co-ordination and delivery of public investment in the docklands.  The backdrop to this was the successful work of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to get special consideration on the regional aid map for the encouragement of small and medium enterprises and industry in the area.The forum's report was submitted in July and set out a policy and economic rationale for the regeneration project; identified key economic and other drivers essential to the realisation of the vision for the area; identified and costed critical public infrastructure required over the lifetime of the project, to 2027 at least, to underpin subsequent private investment; considered significant constraints and barriers to the intended redevelopment; considered how this redevelopment might be incentivised; and made recommendations regarding institutional arrangements to bring the project forward.The forum report envisages highly significant investment in public infrastructure, including the proposed eastern gateway bridge in opening up the south docklands for development, as well as possible support for relocation of port and other activities.  In this regard, a new ring-fenced tax incentive scheme will be established to facilitate the removal and relocation of SEVESO-listed industrial facilities that hinder the residential and commercial regeneration of docklands in urban brownfield areas.  The EU SEVESO directive seeks to protect public safety by placing land-use restrictions on new residential and commercial development near locations where dangerous substances are stored.  Further details will be outlined in the Finance Bill to be published on 20 November.  I commend the Minister for Finance on his positive response to this issue, which also will affect other docklands areas.  We have been working together to try to move this agenda forward.  This scheme is subject to clearance by the European Commission from an EU state aids perspective.  However, preliminary work has been undertaken by the forum with the Commission in this regard.  The cost of this measure will depend on take-up.The gateway innovation fund was designed to incentivise joined-up planning and delivery of development initiatives in the national spatial strategy-designated gateway cities and towns, in conjunction with the private sector and complementing other NDP investment.  While, in the overall context of budgetary decisions, it has been necessary to defer allocations under the fund for 2009, I recognise the strategic potential of targeted investment for the future to drive and facilitate development and build on the local momentum in the gateways.  There is constant engagement with the Minister for Finance and other Ministers with regard to this bridge.  As for the agency issue, the forum was clear in this regard.  Moreover, this is a national project and the experience of the forum showed the importance of the involvement of a variety of Departments.  It ensured acquiescence and inputs from the relevant Departments, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Arts, Sport and Tourism; Finance and so on.  It is an important part of the spatial strategy and that is the rationale behind having an agency approach to the development itself.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for taking the Adjournment.  First, I pay tribute to the more than 40 Irish humanitarian agencies that work with children in Belarus in the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.  On 25 and 26 April 1986, the world's worst nuclear power accident occurred in Chernobyl in the former USSR.  The accident killed more than 30 people immediately and as a result of high radiation levels in the surrounding 20-mile radius, 135,000 people were evacuated.  Unfortunately, the Belarusian Government has announced restrictions on travel visas for children travelling to Ireland for rest and recuperation.  These children come to Ireland to live with host families twice yearly, three months in summer and one month at Christmas.  Since there is significant concern they will not be able to travel for Christmas, I hope the Minister will have news in that regard.  The trip gives their immune systems a chance to recover from radiation and the children, mostly orphans, receive tender love and care from their adoptive families.Further complicating the issue is the matter of a bilateral agreement on child care sought by the Belarusian Government last year which still has not been completed by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This agreement needs to be handled immediately as the repercussions of tardiness may have terrible implications for the children of Belarus travelling to Ireland.  The responsibility for this agreement lies with the Minister's Department.  Without it, families are unable to progress any further on the problem of travel restrictions.  It is imperative that the issue be resolved in the next two weeks to allow at least some of the children visit their Irish families for Christmas.Let us be under no illusion.  Unless the child care agreement is finalised, children from Belarus will not be allowed to travel to Ireland again.  The document has been awaiting completion in the Department since April 2007.  The Government must not miss this opportunity as it may not get another.  A similar opportunity in respect of adoptions was missed some years ago, since when there have been no adoptions between Belarus and Ireland.  The restrictions imposed are that no child over the age of 14 will take part in the rest and recuperation programme and no child will travel more than three times in his or her lifetime to any one country.It is important that the bilateral agreement be signed and sealed by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Health and Children immediately.  Failure to comply with the agreement will most certainly seal the fate of the Chernobyl children as it is highly unlikely that Ireland will get any second chance in this regard.On 13 October, the President of the Republic of Belarus signed a decree introducing amendments and additions to another decree on children's recuperation abroad on the basis of foreign aid, which was issued on 18 February 2004.  The President's press service states that, according to the decree, Belarusian organisations will be entitled to send children for recuperation to the foreign countries with which Belarus has concluded international agreements with the provision of government guarantees of safe stay and scheduled returns.  Such an agreement has only been concluded with Italy.While agreements are being negotiated, Belarus permits foreign health promotion trips of special groups formed of children who cannot go abroad in regular groups because of document supported medical contra-indications.  The new decree establishes age limits and restrictions on the number of visits to a single country.  From now on, recuperation abroad is only available to children of up to 14 years of age and they can go to the same country no more than three times.The Council of the Republic of Belarus has approved the ratification of the Belarusian-ltalian agreement stipulating terms and conditions on recuperation holidays.  I urge the Government to sign a similar agreement with Belarus.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I urge the Minister to use his skills and many talents, especially in diplomacy, to seek a resolution to this matter, bearing in mind the outstanding efforts of the volunteers and host families.  Bonds of friendship and contacts between various families and children in Ireland and Belarus have been formed.  It is a hand of friendship from a well-off country to a less well-off country.I ask the Minister to bear in mind the issue of visas.  The change from what was a group visa to individual visas makes coming to Ireland difficult for the Belarusian children who most need it because they must now travel to Moscow.  The Minister is aware of the situation and I support his efforts.  I urge him to leave no stone unturned in realising the dreams and hopes of many in this country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  Visits to Ireland by children from the Chernobyl region of Belarus have been continuing for more than 17 years.  There are approximately 50 associations in Ireland involved in bringing to this country more than 2,500 children each year for rest and recuperation.  I cannot praise too highly the selfless efforts of the many charities and families who respond so generously year after year.  In recognition of the valuable work of one of the charities, Chernobyl Children's Project International, Irish Aid committed €600,000 over three years in March 2008 for the development of day care centres in Belarus.The Belarusian authorities have frequently underlined their satisfaction with the welcome afforded the children in Ireland.  However, as a result of the failure of a small number of children to return home from other states following recuperation visits, Belarus has proposed to a number of EU member states, including Ireland, formal agreements that would secure the welfare of the children and ensure their return to Belarus.  Pending the conclusion of such agreements, the Belarusian Government indicated in late August that it would be suspending visits by Chernobyl children.Securing the continuation of the Chernobyl children's visits to Ireland is of considerable importance to me as it is to the host families and I am determined to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.  As soon as I learned about the suspension of visits, I met Ms Adi Roche of Chernobyl Children's Project International on 8 September to hear her concerns at first hand.  I asked Ireland's ambassador to Moscow, who is also accredited to Belarus, to travel to Minsk the following day to register the Government's strong concern about the suspension of the children's visits in the absence of a formal agreement.  I have subsequently met other organisations, including the one headed by Mr. Liam Grant in the south east.On 11 September, at my invitation, the chargé d'affaires of the Belarusian Embassy in London travelled to Dublin.  We confirmed to him that we would work with the Belarusian authorities to arrive at an agreement between our two Governments that would provide a framework for future visits.  There followed an intensive series of exchanges at official level in September and early October and a revised draft agreement was forwarded by my Department to the Belarusian authorities on 6 October.  A response to this requesting further information was received from Belarus on 16 October.In the meantime, I met the Belarusian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, in Luxembourg on 13 October.  During a cordial exchange, I expressed the Government's strong hope that, even if negotiations with the Belarusian Government were not fully concluded, visits by the Chernobyl children to Ireland would be allowed to go ahead over Christmas.In a separate but related development, however, the Irish ambassador in Moscow was informed by the Belarusian authorities on 16 October that a presidential decree had been signed covering travel by Belarusian children overseas.  The decree completely blocks such visits to countries where there is no bilateral agreement.  Regarding countries that conclude agreements after 1 October, it limits visits to those children between the ages of seven and 14 and the number of visits to any one country to a maximum of three.  Those countries with agreements that were concluded in advance of that date have no such restrictions.  There is only one such country.Following consultations with a number of Chernobyl non-governmental organisations, it was decided that the presidential decree also needed to be addressed in the terms of our draft agreement.  On 24 October, my Department replied to the Belarusian note of 16 October and proposed a method of doing this.  A response attaching a new draft of the agreement was received through our embassy in Moscow late on 14 November.  The text of the revised agreement is being examined closely by officials in my Department and in the Office of the Minister for Children in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  An interdepartmental meeting will be held the day after tomorrow to determine our response.  In addition, at a meeting of the Government this morning, I secured the formal consent of colleagues to the signature of the agreement once negotiations have concluded.  It is intended to forward our response to Minsk without delay with a view to finalising the negotiations at the earliest possible date.  Officials are on standby to go to Minsk if required.  I am also ready to intervene further at the political level if necessary.My Department has received positive indications from Belarusian officials that visits by children from Belarus can continue while the negotiating process is ongoing.  I hope that these indications can be confirmed with the Belarusian Government in the coming days.  Close contact is being maintained with the charities dealing with Chernobyl children as the situation evolves and I am determined to find a satisfactory outcome to this issue.We are at the penultimate stage in this delicate process and we have worked closely with all of the groups to resolve the issue together.  The response to the process has been positive.  I understand people's concerns but there is a need for patience on all sides.  We will do everything possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution in respect of this matter.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue relating to my locality.  The situation to which I wish to refer is no doubt replicated throughout the country.  In June of this year, the management of the Christian Brothers high school, Clonmel, noticed a leak in the building that houses the first year and transition year students.  The building was erected in 1899 and is now a listed structure.  Architects and builders investigated the nature of the leak in June and discovered that the damage to the roof was considerable.  In light of the serious nature of the damage and the fact that the building is listed, they recommended that the roof be replaced.When there is wet weather in Clonmel, the roof leaks.  When heavy rain occurs, tiles tend to slide off the roof and there is a danger that they might hit students.  Some 156 students, approximately 20% of the population of the school, use the building each day.  They are placed in danger when walking through it because the floors are chronically slippy and the stairs are incredibly hazardous.  While tiles do not fall from the roof regularly, the danger to first year and transition year students remains.This urgent situation was brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Science and an application was made for emergency funding.  The latter was refused.  The authorities at the school are afraid to put students at risk during the winter months in such a negligent manner.  Knowing the dangers inherent in this situation, on which the architect briefed them, they are afraid that they would be liable for damages if a child were hurt.  The authorities at the school must inform their insurance company of the issue and are afraid that the building may be closed because it is unsafe.  There is no doubt that this is an emergency funding situation, particularly when one considers that it would cost €150,000 plus fees to repair the roof.I hope the Minister will be able to provide reasonably good news in respect of this matter.  The provision of a small amount of money to repair the roof at the school could prevent someone being hurt.  I visited the school on several occasions.  It is an old school and does great work in the heart of Clonmel.  I urge the Minister to ensure that it is catered for by the provision of a small amount of capital funding.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to outline to the House the Department's position regarding the allocation of funding for Ardscoil na mBráithre, Clonmel, County Tipperary.The main purpose of the emergency works scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an unforeseen event of a capital nature that can arise during the course of a school year.  This process will elicit specific relevant information to enable a verifiable, speedy and equitable process.  Primary and post-primary schools requiring emergency works to be undertaken in the current year must apply under this scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is solely for unforeseen emergencies.  It is not intended that it be used to supplement previous applications under other schemes that have not been successful in securing funding in the current year.  All relevant and supporting information in respect of an application must be provided in order to support a claim for emergency grant aid.  All applications are dealt with on an individual basis.Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, almost €4.5 billion has been allocated to the school building and modernisation programme.  The Department of Education and Science has an allocation of €586 million this year — and a similar figure next year — for the school building programme.  The emergency works grant scheme is one of a number of component elements or sub-programmes of the capital allocation.  The other elements include large-scale building projects — new school buildings and major extensions-refurbishments; site acquisitions; remediation programmes — asbestos removal, radon mitigation; furniture and equipment; and provision of temporary accommodation etc.  It is also the intention of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to introduce a summer works scheme in 2009.In light of the large number of projects seeking funding under this scheme and the competing demands on the budget allocated, it was not possible to provide funding for all applications received.  In general, it is open to the unsuccessful applicants to reapply for funding for these works in 2009.The Management Authority of Ardscoil na mBráithre applied for funding under the emergency works scheme last August to carry out works to the roof of the old high school building.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to fund the project at that time.  The management authority has submitted a further appeal in the matter and this is under consideration.  The school will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position in respect of the school to the House.

This is the largest ever package for such rural development in Ireland and is almost treble the level of funding available under the previous LEADER Programmes.I am delighted to be able to announce this package of funding, particularly in light of the economic challenges currently facing the country.  This considerable investment in rural Ireland is expected to result in the creation of more than 12,000 full time jobs and support for 10,000 new and existing micro-enterprises.In this context, and on the basis of complementary investment from the CLÁR Programme and the Rural Social Scheme, I believe we will see significant  and sustained benefits across rural Ireland over the coming years.

This funding supports valued services that community & voluntary groups provide to Irish society on a not-for-profit basis. In addition, the role of the sector has been reflected in the evolution of social partnership over recent years.The Government has also made significant progress in pursuing a more supportive environment for the non-profit sector, as articulated in Towards 2016.  In this context, the Deputy should note that the Charities Bill 2007 was passed by Dáil Éireann on 5 November last and is expected to commence its passage through the Seanad in the coming weeks. I am confident that the Bill will help to secure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud, thus enhancing public confidence in the charities sector.In relation to volunteering, my Department is providing annual funding of nearly €2.5 million to twenty volunteer centres located across the country.  So far this year, these centres have registered over 5,660 volunteers and over 800 volunteer-involving organisations. It is also worth noting that 56% of registered volunteers had never volunteered before and 70% are aged 35 years and under. To date 2,300 volunteers have been placed by the Volunteer Centres, which will generate over 151,000 volunteering hours this year alone.In addition, a range of other activities to encourage greater active citizenship are being supported by my Department. These include:The Young Social Innovators Initiative which involves transition year students identifying social needs and in developing strategies to address them;The Dublin Institute of Technology's Community Learning Programme. This promotes community- based learning by integrating classroom theory with practical application in projects for community and voluntary bodies. Examples of projects include computing science students designing web pages for voluntary bodies, or food science students providing health and safety audits in community kitchens;Focus Ireland which supports the placement of social science graduates within the organisation, who wish to gain experience and to develop skills in working with people who are marginalised;Support for Boardmatch, an organisation which supports the development of the voluntary and community sector in Ireland by strengthening boards of management and management committees of non-profit organisations; andA cross-border volunteering initiative with the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland, which will pilot action research into how recruitment of volunteers can be encouraged and how volunteers recruited within different spheres can provide the catalyst for wider community involvement and the development of active communities.I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the work of the Forum on Philanthropy.  Developments since the establishment of the Forum include Government approval of flagship projects with the private sector to the value of €51 million; the publication of Philanthropy Ireland's Guide to Giving; the endorsement of increased philanthropic activity by the Task Force on Active Citizenship and the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.  The work of the Forum is on-going.Finally, it should be noted that my Department also provides funding to the community & voluntary sector for training in relation to capacity building in governance and compliance, strategic development, and services to communities, through a range of different programmes. Details of these are available on my Department's website — www.pobail.ie.

Relevant schemes include the Rural Development Programme, the CLÁR programme, the Rural Social Scheme, the Enterprise Scheme for non-Gaeltacht offshore islands and the Community Services Programme and Rural Recreation Schemes.The LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007–2013, includes particular measures in relation to rural enterprise development.  The overall aim of the new LEADER Programme is to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy, which I believe is key to achieving sustainable economic growth and stability in rural regions. The Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the outcome of the selection process for Local Action Groups to deliver the LEADER element of the RDP and I expect it to be open to applications from local project promoters shortly.The funding available for the delivery of LEADER-type activities under the RDP will amount to €425.4 million — almost treble the €150 million available for the 2000-06 period.   In relation to the Western Region, the Local Action Groups have between them secured more than €117.5m. This does not include additional allocations, which will benefit Gaeltacht and Island regions.  The new programme will also complement the other rural development measures operated by my Department.In addition to the schemes and programmes operated directly by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that responsibility for the creation of employment in Gaeltacht areas rests with Údarás na Gaeltachta, a body that comes within the ambit of my Department. The work of this body includes the development of rural enterprises. Following continued investment over the past number of years, Údarás has maintained the overall employment base in the Galway and Mayo Gaeltacht region, with 3,711 people in full time employment and 1,577 in part time employment in client companies at the end of 2007. Information in relation to assistance provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts which, under sections 18 and 19 of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act 1979, are laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Information is also available on its website at www.udaras.ie.Finally, the Western Development Commission, another body that comes within the ambit of my Department, has responsibility for fostering and promoting economic and social development, including rural enterprise and job creation in the Western Region. Since its inception in 2000 up to the end of 2007, it has invested over €31m and helped to create or sustain 1,086 jobs in the Region. Further information in relation to the support provided by the WDC is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts, which are also laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Information is also available on its website at www.wdc.ie.

I hope to be in a position to sign contracts with the Groups in the near future.  However, contracts will only be signed with those Groups who are fully cohesed and  who have completed the transfer of Rural Social Scheme participants from the old LEADER companies.  Provision of funding to the newly selected Groups will be made in the context of finalisation of contracts.

In accordance with a decision made by the North South Ministerial Council in 2007, and in order to secure good practice and value for money, the functions and funding of Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge transferred to Foras na Gaeilge with effect from 1 January 2008.  The Council also decided at its meeting on 4 July 2008 that the functions, staffing and funding of Colmcille in Ireland should transfer to Foras na Gaeilge and arrangements to that end are in hand.  I am not in a position to comment on any specific future plans at this stage.I should also mention that, the Charities Bill 2007, which was passed by Dáil Éireann on 5th November 2008, provides for the dissolution of the Office of Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland. The Bill further provides that the Office of Commissioners will be replaced by a new Charities Regulatory Authority, which will take on the statutory functions of the Office of Commissioners, as well as having broader statutory regulatory functions relating to charities operating in the jurisdiction.  It is expected that Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad will be taken in the coming weeks.In addition a number of local development agencies receive funding through my Department or through Pobal for local delivery of community and rural development measures.  This number comprises a total of 94 local development bodies and 184 community development projects.  Arising from the cohesion process, which involves the merger of overlapping LEADER and Partnership groups, the number of local development bodies are being reduced from 94 to 54.Further opportunities to secure improved efficiencies and outcomes across bodies within the ambit of the Department will be pursued over the coming period.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 108 and 382 together.Work on the development of a new National Drugs Strategy to cover the period 2009-2016 has been ongoing in my Department throughout 2008 and is continuing.The Steering Group established to develop proposals and make recommendations to me on the new Strategy has been meeting regularly during the year and the frequency of these meetings has increased in recent weeks as they work towards finalising their proposals.Meanwhile, the consultants engaged to support the Steering Group have completed their work.  Their input included the facilitation, reporting and drawing conclusions from the extensive consultation process that was undertaken earlier this year.   This process included 15 public meetings and 40 consultation meetings with various statutory, voluntary & community sectors representatives and organisations of interests.  In addition, over 140 written submissions were received.Apart from attending a number of the consultation meetings, I also participated in a debate in the Seanad in June and met with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in September to hear their views on the new Strategy.As part of its terms of reference, the Steering Group is examining the progress and impact of the current Drugs Strategy, the degree to which it continues to be relevant and the operational effectiveness of the structures that underpin the implementation of the Strategy. They are also looking at developments in regard to drug policies at EU and international levels.I am expecting to receive the Steering Group's recommendations in the New Year and I would hope to publish the new Strategy by the end of March 2009.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I propose to take Questions Nos.  92 and 129 together.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department's Budget Day estimate for 2009 was published on 14 October 2008.  Overall funding is reduced by a total of 6%, with current expenditure reduced by 5% and capital expenditure by 8.5%.My primary concern is to ensure that the daily front line services provided through my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially disadvantaged communities, are protected.  Administrative overheads are targeted for particular reductions so that the wide range of services my Department provides, in partnership with other bodies and agencies across urban, rural, Gaeltacht and island communities, is maintained.  Key areas in this regard include the Drugs Initiative, the Rural Social Scheme, the Community Services Programme, the Dormant Accounts-funded Initiatives on Tackling Economic & Social Disadvantage, supports for the Community and Voluntary Sector, the National Rural Development Programme, the Gaeltacht, Islands and the Irish language, and North-South co-operation.Across Government, we have had to take a range of difficult decisions, but our approach has been to do it in as balanced a way as possible. We are all faced with difficult decisions in the current economic circumstances, particularly in the short term. There will still be positive news for 2009 — for example, in the case of rural areas, it will come with the rollout of the new National Rural Development Programme, the largest such programme for diversifying the rural economy and improving the quality of life in rural areas.  €27m has been provided for this Programme next year.Finally, with a total vote of some €520m for 2009, I am confident that, by focusing resources efficiently, we can continue with the very comprehensive work being carried out by my Department.

Waterways Ireland carries out a capital development programme to provide moorings and harbours for public use and other services along the navigation.  However, it is not a grant-giving agency and does not provide financial assistance for groups or individuals to provide similar facilities.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I welcome the success of An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service in targeting the supply of drugs —  both nationally and internationally — with the resultant continuing high levels of seizures on land and at sea.  I am aware that these achievements are based on an intelligence-led approach and I am know that both organisations are committed to continuing to work together to reduce the amount of illicit drugs entering Ireland.In particular, I would like to congratulate the Gardaí and the Customs and Naval Services on last week's record seizure of cocaine off the Cork coast.  Given the global nature of the drugs market, it is vital that jurisdictions ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach across national boundaries.  The most recent Cork seizure demonstrates that Ireland is playing a full role in this regard, and that this is paying off.  The various organisations, including dedicated units such as Criminal Assets Bureau, carry out their work in a spirit of co-operation and help to the mutual benefit of this and other countries.Indeed, Ireland is one of the 7 EU countries involved in the establishment of the Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre — Narcotics (MAOC-N) in 2007 in Lisbon.  The Centre was set up to co-ordinate efforts to counter the movement of cocaine, in particular, from South America into Europe.  It played a crucial role in the recent successful operation and I believe that it will continue to facilitate similar counter measures in the future.I have no plans for meetings in the short-term with the Ministers for Justice Equality & Law Reform, Education & Science and Environment, Heritage & Local Government to discuss drugs seizures.  However, officials of those and other relevant Departments continue to meet on an on-going basis through the structures that underpin the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy.  They are also engaged in developing proposals on a new Drugs Strategy through the Steering Group established for that purpose and I expect to be receiving recommendations in this regard in New Year.I am determined to ensure that the new Drugs Strategy will continue to prioritise supply reduction efforts and the continued seizure of drugs, with a negative impact on the overall drugs trade.

The Government reiterated its position on Budget Day on 14 October 2008.One of the measures decided upon by Government is that all Departments, State agencies and local authorities — other than in Health and Education — reduce their payroll bill by 3% by the end of 2009 through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local circumstances.My Department and the agencies that come within its ambit are currently considering a number of measures to secure a 3% reduction in payroll costs by the end of 2009. These include control of premium pay, management of vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.The key priority for my Department remains the delivery of front-line services and the provision of services to those who most need them, and this is being borne in mind as my Department considers measures and mechanisms to reduce payroll costs by the required 3%. My Department will continue to work with the Department of Finance to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to achieve the savings required.

I and officials of my Department have regular discussions and consultations with the Body in relation to the scope and progress of the programme.The works that Waterways Ireland would propose to undertake are set out in its capital programme, which was published last March.  In summary, the Programme includes:completion of existing projects commenced under the NDP 2000-2006, including the completion of the Royal Canal and extension of the Shannon Navigation towards Dowra and Glasson  (as the Deputy will be aware, approval has also been granted by the North/South Ministerial Council to Waterways Ireland to proceed with the restoration of the stretch of Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones, to be financed from Waterways Ireland own resources);provision of the necessary office buildings, depots, stores, plant and machinery;consolidation of the existing navigations by improving access to and facilities and infrastructure on, and adjacent to, these navigations; andfeasibility studies and preliminary designs to assess the opportunities for extension of navigation to additional destinations linked to the waterways system.Clearly, it will be necessary to keep the proposed programme under review in light of changing circumstances and the ongoing economic situation and it will continue to be subject of ongoing discussion with the Body.

A breakdown of funding across the different Task Force areas since 2003 is set out below.  The outturn for both in 2008 is expected to be of the order of €22m and €10m respectively.Over 440 LDTF projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving funding from my Department.  In the region of 170 of these projects focus on treatment/ rehabilitation and roughly a further 190 have a focus on prevention-type activities.Across the ten RDTF areas, work is progressing on the implementation of their Action Plans and by the end of 2008 it is expected that in the region of 200 projects will be up and running.  Of these, around 90 treatment and rehabilitation projects are being funded and a similar number dealing with prevention.Overall, in 2008, the budget for community-based initiatives in the Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas, including funding for new cocaine and rehabilitation measures introduced during the year, amounts to nearly €34.8m.  While the funding available for 2009 has not yet been finalised, I expect the comparable figure for next year to be in the region of €34.4m.  In this context, the Deputy should note that of the foregoing, funding for projects in Drug Task Forces action plans in 2009 will be maintained at 2008 levels i.e. €32m.In relation to Co. Kildare which is part of the South West Regional Drugs Task Force area, the following allocations have been made:Funding of €150,000 has been allocated to the Abbey Project to provide a number of services such as drop-in, family support, referral, counselling, holistic therapies and advice and information on housing to drug users and their families from Celbridge and the surrounding areas;Fuding of €340,112 was approved for the Community Drug Team for Kildare and West Wicklow  in 2008.  The service will expand and complement existing treatment services along with family support and early responses to young people at the early stage of drug misuse; andAn amount of €22,354 was approved to Newbridge Family Resource Centre in 2007 under the Premises Initiative in respect of the purchase and installation of a semi-permanent structure for the Centre to provide a dedicated drop-in facility for "at risk" youth.Some of the other funding provided to that Drugs Task Force also provides benefit broadly across their region of operation, including Co. Kildare.   In addition, a sum in the region of €170,000 has been made available to Teen Challenge, a rehabilitation project at Shechem House, Richardstown, Co. Kildare, arising from applications through the South Inner City LDTF in Dublin.

As a result, a Government Committee was established to consider matters arising in the context of the analysis and recommendations contained in the Report.  That Committee has met twice and a Senior Officials Group has been established to assist it in its deliberations.  The work of the Committee is ongoing with a view to the production of an integrated action plan as soon as possible to secure the future of Irish as the community language of the Gaeltacht. No decision will be made with regard to implementation until the work of the Committee in this regard is complete.The question of an Oireachtas debate is, of course, a matter for the House and for discussion by the Whips, but the Deputy can take it that I would be happy to participate in any such debate at the appropriate time.

The development of a comprehensive index was prioritised in the current Strategy as it was accepted that the level of drug related deaths — as reported by the General Mortality Register — was understated.  The work involved was funded jointly by the Departments of Health & Children and Justice, Equality & Law Reform.To ensure its accuracy and completeness, the new NDRDI was compiled from four sources of data — the General Mortality Register, the records of the Coroners Service, the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry Scheme and the Central Drugs Treatment List.  While a significant increase in the numbers of deaths was expected, the data also highlights in stark terms the serious challenges that drug misuse poses in our society and I have expressed my deepest sympathy to everyone affected by these deaths.While the figures place us 4th for the number of deaths per 1 million population in the EU (after Estonia, Luxembourg & Denmark) in the 2005/6 period, this is a very misleading statistic as only six countries in Europe have prepared comprehensive indices that can be compared with that now produced for Ireland.The NDRDI is made up of two categories of entry — deaths directly related to drugs (232 in 2005) and indirectly attributed to drugs (168 in 2005 which would include HIV deaths arising from infection from needles exchange, as well as such things as accidents linked to drug use).  The figures have increased between 1998 and 2005 as one would expect, as the period covered since the onset of serious illicit drug usage in Ireland becomes longer.  Work will now be undertaken on the records for 2006 and it is intended to continue to have a comprehensive and timely data available.The NDRDI is another piece of valuable information on the overall drugs situation in Ireland. In this context, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is vital that we have comprehensive and accurate information when developing proposals for a new National Drugs Strategy.  The findings from the Index will now feed into the work on the formulation of the new Strategy and I hope to be receiving recommendations in that regard from the Steering Group, which is overseeing that process, in the New Year.The bottom line is that drugs kill and I hope that the publication of stark facts in the NDRDI will help to prevent some people, at least, from starting a drugs habit and will help others to seek treatment and ultimately to become drug free, before it is too late.

The emphasis will be on ensuring that there is an on-going comprehensive response to drug related problems — rather than on drug-specific measures per se.  However, those involved in dealing with the drugs problem, from the Gardaí to the Health Services, are aware of the potential threat from crystal meth. In 2007 the Gardaí hosted an international conference focusing on crystal meth and experts from many countries, who had experience of its impact, addressed the conference and exchanged information. Meanwhile, the Health Service Executive are re-engineering their drug treatment services towards dealing with the individual, regardless of the drugs they use.  This is increasingly important as more drug users become involved in polydrug use.

In addition to funding major organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and An Taibhdhearc on an annual basis, the Ciste is used to fund critically-important initiatives to support the status of Irish as an EU official and working language and to resource public bodies to implement the Official Languages Act.  These special initiatives include, for example, the development by Fiontar, Dublin City University, of a database of EU terminology in the Irish language. The database also includes terminology required for translation of statutory instruments.  Furthermore since 2006, four new sub-Funds under the Ciste have been established — an Ciste Logainmneacha, an Ciste Gnó, an Ciste Tríú Leibhéal and an Ciste DVDs as Gaeilge, to provide funding for the provision of children's DVDs in the Irish language.As well as providing, as already announced, for a special grant to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the funding provided in the 2009 estimates for Ciste na Gaeilge will facilitate the continuation of the various schemes and initiatives outlined above.  I expect to be in a position to announce precise details of funding being allocated to individual initiatives in early 2009.

The most relevant schemes for the purposes of the Deputy's query are the CLÁR Programme, the Rural Recreation Scheme, the RAPID Programme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) and the Gaeltacht Improvement Schemes.   The total number of recreational areas or parks that have received funding in the past five years under these and other improvement schemes operated by my Department is 1455, of which 172 received funding in the current year. A full detail of the breakdown per programme and per year is outlined in the following table. I will arrange to forward to the Deputy further information in relation to the relevant schemes and programmes, including the specific eligibility criteria.In relation to the agencies within the ambit of my Department, I am advised by the Western Development Commission (WDC) that six recreational projects have benefited from the Western Investment Fund since 2004.  There are two main criteria of eligibility for funding under the WDC Investment Fund. These are:1. The commercial viability of the project and its ability to provide the WDC Investment Fund with an appropriate financial return for the risk undertaken.2. The social benefits accruing to the area served by the project and the region as a whole as a result of the investment, including employment potential and enhancing quality of life.Finally, as regards Údarás na Gaeltachta, I am advised that they have provided funding in the case of 2 recreational areas or parks during the past 5 years.  In addition, I understand that they have given sites on a lease basis for the development of play facilities in 2 further instances, one of which is now completed and works will be commencing shortly on the other.YearCLÁR Primary School Outdoor Play Facilities Enhancement Scheme (No. of schools)Recreational Areas on Off shore islandsGaeltacht Improvement Scheme — Community HallsGaeltacht Improvement Scheme — Pitches & Play AreasYPFSF Capital projectsRRS Failte Ireland Looped WalksRRSCRGA  Walks ProjectsRAPID leverage Playgrounds Grants SchemeRAPID leverage Sports Capital Top-up Scheme20042993675100140200519149560041152006303—1011102102029200718131216493822432200848420904681127

The increased provision in 2008 will allow for the full year cost of the approx. 155 community projects already in progress and the start of a number of new projects, with expenditure expected to reach around €10m by the end of this year.  In addition, nearly €2.3m was allocated to 16 projects this year under the Regional Youth Initiative. This Initiative provides capital funding for the development of dedicated youth facilities in RDTF areas not covered under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.No formal research of the workings and effectiveness of the RDTFs has been carried out to date.  However, the National Drugs Strategy Team, which oversees the workings of the LDTFs and RDTFs, has undertaken training and induction workshops for new Task Force members on financial and procedural matters.  They also meet regularly with the RDTFs Chairpersons and Co-ordinators in order to ensure Task Forces are working effectively.As the establishment of the Task Force structures was a lengthy process, many of the Task Forces are still relatively new and are still in the process of implementing their actions plans. Therefore, I believe it would be premature at this stage to carry out a review of effectiveness before they have reached their full capacity.

These action plans contain initiatives to tackle a range of issues across the pillars of treatment, rehabilitation, supply reduction as well as prevention measures.With regard to cocaine, under the Local Drugs Task Force Emerging Needs Fund, seven dedicated cocaine specific projects were approved for funding in 2005/06.  A further nine projects aimed at poly-drug/cocaine use are also being supported under that Fund.  Over €1m is provided annually through the National Drugs Strategy to support these projects and I recently approved an additional €300,000 to further develop and enhance four of these initiatives.  These will continue to be rolled out in 2009.The Deputy should also note that my Department provided funding for four pilot cocaine projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative for frontline personnel to deal with cocaine issues.   In this regard, I recently approved almost €150,000 for one of these projects — located in Tallaght — to further develop their response to cocaine.Although some savings may have to be identified within the projects above, funding will continue into 2009.I also provided funding of €500,000 to the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces to run their own locally based awareness campaigns on cocaine which will highlight the issues raised in the national campaign but will focus on issues relating to cocaine use in their own areas.Finally, it should be noted that a further €750,000 was allocated this year to address cocaine use in local communities across both Regional and Local Drugs Task Force areas.  The majority of this allocation will fund dedicated cocaine and poly-drug workers and 12 such proposals were approved across the Task Force areas. The funding will also provide for cross-Task Force cocaine training.   Many of these projects will be rolled out next year or will be rolled out at a protracted rate, taking into consideration the priorities of Task Forces and the savings to be identified in 2009.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The estimate of €56,000 for 2009 in respect of the Active Citizenship Office provides for the non-pay administrative costs of the Office.  The Office, together with a Steering Group on Active Citizenship, recently appointed by the Minister of State with special responsibility for Active Citizenship, will seek to progress the recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.  The recommendations, for the most part, relate to initiatives being undertaken by Government Departments and the costs of implementation of the initiatives will be borne in the Departments' votes.In addition, there is continuing substantial support for active citizenship initiatives within the corporate sector.  I am satisfied, within the financial resources available, that the Steering Group on Active Citizenship will make good progress in effecting their task.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	527	22 former members of staff from my Department have already been assigned to decentralised posts.  The grades of these former staff are as follows: 4 Assistant Principals, 3 Higher Executive Officers, 2 Administrative Officers, 5 Executive Officers, 2 Staff Officers and 6 Clerical Officers.There are no proposals to decentralise my Department.  It is a matter for those Departments to which staff from my Department have decentralised to assign such staff to locations outside of Dublin.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The National Employment Survey (NES) is an annual survey of employers and employees in both the public and private sectors, covering all sectors of the economy. The NES provides valuable information on the structure and distribution of employee earnings, and on the factors influencing earnings and employment conditions, to meet national and EU needs. In total it has an annual sample of approximately 10,000 employers and 100,000 employees.The Annual Services Inquiry (ASI) is an annual structural survey of the traded services sector. The surveys provide valuable information on the structure and distribution of enterprises, principal trading aggregates and other items such as E-Commerce etc. It is conducted by the Central Statistics Office in order to meet EU legal obligations and national statistical needs. There is a sample of approximately 20,000 enterprises in the survey every year.The CSO recognises that surveys impose a burden, particularly on small businesses when they are included in the surveys. In its Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, the CSO has identified as a corporate priority the minimising of response burden on CSO inquiry respondents. The CSO is also committed to monitoring and reporting on progress in reducing the response burden on businesses, while continuing to meet the growing demands for statistics on business sectors and competitiveness. In June 2008 the CSO published the "Report on Response Burden placed on Irish Businesses by CSO inquiries, 2007". This report indicated that  in enterprises with less than 20 persons engaged, 61.3% never received any CSO form in 2007 while another 32.3% only received one form.Steps have been taken and will continue to be taken to keep the response burden to a minimum. These include:In both surveys, only a  sample of small enterprises is included. For example, while the NES includes all enterprises with 250 or more employees, only 5% of enterprises with between three and nine employees inclusive are surveyed.  In addition, only enterprises with three or more employees are included in the survey. Similarly, in the case of the ASI only 10% of enterprises with between one and four employees inclusive are surveyed.In both surveys, the sample is rotated each year, to reduce the chance that a small business will be asked to take part in consecutive years.The CSO has been working in consultation with payroll software providers to reduce the burden of response on enterprises. These payroll companies have installed an optional  CSO "module" on their payroll packages which will extract all the payroll data required for the NES (and also for the new quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey or EHECS). This innovation will lead to a significant reduction in burden on those companies using the modules. The modules are currently been rolled out by the payroll companies and will be available for the NES from 2009 onwards.The potential for similar electronic reporting options in the ASI and other large annual business surveys is also being examined.The CSO is exploring the potential for greater use of administrative sources of data (e.g. Revenue data) in order to avoid asking businesses to provide information which can be sourced elsewhere. This offers the potential of reducing sample sizes and issuing shorter questionnaires in some surveys.The list of questions in the NES and ASI surveys are also continuously reviewed, with a view to keeping to a minimum the overall burden on businesses.This is in line with Government's overall effort to measure and reduce administrative burdens placed on business by 25% by 2012.

The Department has a different customer base to many line Departments which deliver services to the general public.The role of the Department of the Taoiseach is to provide leadership in the development, implementation and co-ordination of key Government policy areas including Northern Ireland, European Affairs, Public Service Modernisation and Economic and Social policy. The Modernisation Action Plans for the Department under both Sustaining Progress and its successor agreement Towards 2016 contained several commitments across a number of key areas common to the Civil Service as a whole, such as human resource management, financial management, quality customer service and technological innovation.  I am satisfied that benchmarking is leading to real change and modernisation in the way the Department does its business.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	535	Data from the most recent National Employment Survey (NES) shows that an estimated 301,400 employees were paid less than €300 per week in the reference period October 2006. This was equivalent to 18% of all employees. These earnings include the gross earnings paid to the employee before the deduction of tax, PRSI and superannuation. They include normal wages, salaries and overtime; taxable allowances, shift allowances, regular bonuses and commissions; holiday or sick pay for the reference period. They exclude redundancy payments, back pay and irregular bonuses and commissions.Wages and salaries may be only one element of a person's income, as they may have income from other sources such as State benefits or income from assets.  On the other hand, many people do not have any direct source of personal income, e.g. dependent persons in households.  In the latest results from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2006, an estimated 1.53 million persons aged 18 or over had a weekly income below €300 per week.  Of these, 25% were classified as ‘at work'.

The most recent NES was published in September 2008 and uses data collected in October 2006 as its reference point.The National Minimum Wage rate in operation in October 2006 was €7.65 per hour. An estimated 63,700 employees were paid that amount or less, equivalent to 3.8% of all employees.  Approximately 163,400 employees were paid €8.65 or less per hour, which was equivalent to 9.6% of all employees at that time.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The Transparency Directive (2004/109/EC), inter alia, establishes EU-wide requirements in relation to the disclosure of major shareholdings by investors in respect of issuers whose securities are already admitted to trading on a regulated market.  This Directive replaced the EU legislation that had applied prior to the adoption of the new measure.  The Directive was transposed into Irish law on 13 June 2007 by means of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 277 of 2007) and Part 3 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2006.  The implementing legislation allows the competent authority to make additional rules, as necessary, to enable it to ensure effective compliance with the provisions of the new law.In accordance with Article 24 of the Directive the Financial Regulator was designated in Part 8 of the Regulations as the central administrative competent authority with responsibility for ensuring that the disclosure provisions in the Regulations are applied.  Under Part 8 of the Regulations the Financial Regulator has delegated certain tasks to the Irish Stock Exchange.  However, the Financial Regulator retains overall responsibility for ensuring compliance.Under the 2007 Regulations, notification to the Irish Stock Exchange is required when a person's shareholding in an issuer company that is admitted to trading on a regulated market reaches or crosses certain percentage thresholds. The relevant threshold for Irish issuers is 3%, and each 1% thereafter, up to 100%.  An option was available to Member States to have a threshold lower than the 5% required by the Directive and Ireland chose to set 3% as the threshold in the interest of increased transparency.A person making a notification to an issuer is obliged at the same time to file a copy of the notification electronically with the Irish Stock Exchange.  Upon receipt of the notification the issuer must make public all the information contained in the notification.  The notification requirement applies only to shares with voting rights attached.Under Regulations 39 and 40 of the 2007 Regulations, the Financial Regulator has power to monitor whether issuers disclose timely information and to take appropriate action if that is not the case.  The Regulator can also make public the fact that an issuer or shareholder or other person as set out in the Regulations is failing to comply with his or her obligations.  The Financial Regulator has not brought breaches of notification requirements in 2007 or 2008 to my attention.Breaches of notification requirements are investigated, in the first instance, by the Irish Stock Exchange, which the Financial Regulator has appointed as its delegate in this regard.  Regulation 67 of the Regulations sets out the sanctions that may be imposed for a contravention of the notification requirements.  These include public caution or reprimand and monetary penalties up to a maximum of €2.5 million.Notification of major shareholdings in respect of issuers admitted to trading on markets other than regulated markets, such as the Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) of the Irish Stock Exchange, continues to be governed by Part IV of the Companies Act 1990 which applied to all issuers prior to the implementation of the Transparency Regulations. Consideration is being given to extending the Regulations to these issuers.

The operation of the Joint Labour Committee system has recently been considered by the social partners in the course of their negotiation of the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement.Minimum rates of pay and other conditions of employment for workers in certain sectors, including the hotels and catering sectors, are set down in Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) made by the Labour Court. These orders are legally binding and are determined on the basis of proposals drawn up by the employer and employee representatives on the relevant Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). The JLCs are independent bodies and are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in a particular sector with an independent Chairman.In the context of our voluntarist approach to collective bargaining, each of the JLCs covering the catering and hotels sectors have agreed a set of terms and conditions, including the payment of premia for Sunday work, to apply to the workers covered by their respective remits.I am aware of the concerns that have been raised by some employers regarding the impact of Sunday premia payments, particularly in the current economic environment.  Any adjustment or variation in the rates applying to Sunday work in these sectors remains a matter for agreement by the parties represented on the JLCs.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	540	Minimum rates of pay, and other conditions of work, for workers in certain sectors are determined by Joint Labour Committees (JLCs). Each JLC is composed of representatives of workers and employers in the sector concerned. The pay and conditions agreed by the JLCs are given the force of law in Employment Regulation Orders made by the Labour Court on foot of proposals made to the Court by the JLCs. It is within this framework that the JLCs covering the hotels and catering sectors have, over the years, agreed a set of terms and conditions, including the payment of premia for Sunday work, to apply to the workers covered by their respective remits.The table below sets out details of the number of inspections conducted by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) to date in 2008 in the catering and hotel sector, in the course of which breaches of the Sunday double pay provisions have been detected.Where breaches of employment rights legislation are detected, NERA in the first instance engages with the employer to seeks the rectification of those breaches and the payment of any arrears due to employees arising from the breaches. To date in 2008 some €562,000 in arrears relating to breaches of the pay provisions (including Sunday pay provisions) of the Employment Regulation Orders governing the Catering and Hotels sectors has been recovered on behalf of employees.To date in 2008, no prosecutions have yet been initiated in respect of employment rights breaches detected in the catering or hotel sectors.CountyEmployers in Breach of Sunday PremiumCarlow10Cavan2Clare15Cork33Donegal10Dublin37Galway39Kerry8Kildare12Kilkenny9Laois19Leitrim5Limerick46Longford5Louth12Mayo3Meath9Monaghan3Offaly25Roscommon13Sligo13Tipperary14Waterford11Westmeath41Wexford19Wiclow37Total450
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has responsibility for enforcing the minimum statutory employment rights to which employees are entitled, including employees in the catering and hotel sectors.  These rights and entitlements are set out in Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) covering the sectors — Statutory Instruments 228 of 2007 and 142 of 2008 covering the catering sector and Statutory Instrument 149 of 2008 covering the Hotels sector. While NERA enforces the terms of the EROs, the Orders themselves are Statutory Instruments made by the Labour Court following proposals agreed by employer and employee representatives through the Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) for the appropriate sector.  NERA does not have a role in the formulation or the making of EROs.NERA inspectors are empowered under the Industrial Relations Act to enforce the minimum pay rates and conditions of employment as prescribed in EROs.  The EROs do not give any discretion to inspectors insofar as the minimum rates of pay set by the JLCs are concerned.Any amendment to the existing EROs for the Catering and Hotels sectors would require, in the first instance, the submission of proposals by the relevant JLC to the Labour Court. The Labour Court may, by Order, give effect to any such proposals (with or without amendment). The Labour Court has recently received agreement in principle to amalgamation of the two JLCs in the catering sector and I have written to the Court requesting that the relevant legislative procedures be put in place to provide for the establishment of a single JLC for the sector.  When in place, the single Catering JLC will provide the appropriate forum in which the Sunday Premium issue can be addressed.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The wages and conditions of employment of workers in the Catering and Hotels industries are governed by Employment Regulation Orders (EROs). While NERA enforces the terms of these EROs, the orders themselves are made by the Labour Court following proposals agreed by employer and employee representatives in the context of the deliberations of the joint labour committees (JLCs) for the catering and hotels sectors.  Neither the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment nor NERA have any role or function in relation to the formulation of proposals or the making of such orders.The Catering EROs provide that every second Sunday within the 78 hour fortnight is regarded as a day off. The Hotels Employment Regulation Order provides for alternate Sundays off during the off-season.These provisions are consistent with the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 which provides that an employee's weekly rest period should include a Sunday unless the employer and employee agree, in the context of the employee's contract of employment, to an arrangement whereby the employee receives his/her rest period of 24 hours on a day of the week other than Sunday.In circumstances in which employers roster employees on all Sundays, NERA inspectors will determine compliance on the basis of the following criteria:(a) have the employees concerned consented to being rostered in this manner;(b) is the employer paying the correct combination of Sunday premium/overtime; and(c) are the employees receiving an alternative weekly rest period as required under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	The first Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The Body reported in June 2002 and recommended varying levels of pay increases for the grades examined. The Benchmarking Body, in their first report, recommended that, apart from the first quarter of the award, the payment of the balance should be dependent on real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, flexibility and change. This was endorsed by the social partners in Sustaining Progress. It was also agreed that the final two phases of the benchmarking increases should be conditional on satisfactory implementation of the modernisation agenda and the maintenance of industrial relations stability.The change agenda as set out in Sustaining Progress and subsequent action plans reflected the priorities of the various sectors. The Towards 2016 Agreement built on the progress made under previous partnership agreements and reaffirmed commitment to the further development and accelerated implementation of modernisation frameworks in each sector of the public service in order to secure the flexibility required to achieve the highest international standards.  It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on previous achievements in areas such as:more responsive and better quality customer services;better management of performance — individually and organisationally;better financial and human resource management;greater flexibility and openness to change.Critically, Towards 2016 sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the civil service through the establishment of Civil Service Performance Verification Groups.  Under the terms of the agreement, the CSPVG is required to satisfy itself on progress in relation to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with the satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement, the maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement before recommending the pay increases provided for under the agreement.My Department is responsible for the development and delivery of a wide range of customer-oriented policy initiatives and services, and all of the improvements made in these areas in recent years are listed in the Actions Plans and Progress Reports that were submitted to the CSPVG under the Partnership Agreements. Copies of the Reports and of the CSPVG responses in respect of my Department are available on their website at www.cspvg.gov.ie.The benefits arising to my Department from the benchmarking and associated Partnership processes are detailed in those reports. In general, though, they include the development of a more performance-oriented culture, an improved focus on accountability with closely defined responsibilities, and a better use of ICT with the development of a wider and more customer-oriented range of on-line services.More specific achievements in this area by my Department include:improved customer service through online publication of the Patents Office Official Journal which provides better public access to specialised information concerning intellectual property rights in Irelandthe creation of a central repository of legislation, briefing material and information on employment rights legislation in order to create a single, searchable repository of all such legislationthe establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA)meeting targets (90%) for the number of suppliers being paid by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), andachieving all specific targets identified in our external Customer Charter.

Representatives were advised by FÁS that if there was no progress towards achieving the targets funding would be discontinued.FÁS continues to run the current suite of programmes in Carrick-on-Suir, i.e. three Community Employment (CE) Projects with 62 places, a Job Initiative programme, with 5 places and the Local Employment Service. In addition FÁS has announced a Core Employment Skills programme which will start in Carrick-on-Suir in November.FÁS is committed to supporting those in Carrick-on-Suir who are unemployed and has initiated discussions with other community interests in the town to determine what alternative programmes would attract potential participants and address the needs of unemployed people.

This proposal will involve the review of four existing EU consumer Directives on Distance Selling, Doorstep Selling, Unfair Terms in Contracts and on Consumer Sales and Guarantees.The proposed Directive is intended to codify horizontal issues such as common terms in the Directives. These include the definition of consumer and trader; the length of cooling off periods during which a consumer may withdraw from a contract without incurring any penalty; and the manner of withdrawal.I welcome the Commission's proposal for a draft Framework Directive on Consumer Rights.   I fully support the empowerment of consumers and recognise the need for strong consumer protection.  I expect that the outcome of our discussions on the proposed Directive will result in a simplified and coherent regulatory environment with increased certainty for both consumers and traders as to their respective rights and obligations.

Any additional cost would be offset by reductions in costs associated with staff on higher scales being replaced by staff on lower scales.The administration of incremental pay increases in the agencies under the remit of my Department is a day-to-day matter for the agencies concerned.  My Department has no role or function in this process.

Sickness absence for this purpose is measured in "duration days" (i.e. span of sickness absence from date of the first absence to date of return to work) rather than actual working days lost.Separately, my Department has begun a detailed examination of sickness absence, applying international best practice principles.  Our first examination was done in respect of the calendar year 2007.  Considerable man-hours were required to undertake this examination and my Department decided that while such examinations would henceforth be done annually, applying similar resources to previous years' data could not be justified.   However, in response to the Deputy's question, and in the time available, my Department has been able to ascertain the information sought in respect of 2006 also.

This was equivalent to 163,400 employees out of a total number of 1,685,200 employees. The National Minimum hourly wage age rate in operation in October 2006 was €7.65. The October 2006 National Survey found that 3.8% of employees were in receipt of that rate, which was equivalent to 63,700 employees.The National Employment Survey (NES) is an annual workplace survey conducted by the CSO. The purpose of the NES is to provide more detailed structural information than before on workplace issues, including earnings and the factors influencing earnings and labour costs. It has been designed as an integrated survey that addresses issues of national interest, while simultaneously fulfilling requirements under EU law. The first results were published in May 2005 and it became an annual survey in 2006.  Results for October 2006 were published in September 2008.

SFI expenditure to date in relation to the 2008 awards is €10.7m with the remainder of the awards to be paid out over the remainder of 2008, 2009 and 2010.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	552	As part of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) the Government recognises the important contribution of engineering to the economic competitiveness of Ireland and proposes significant growth and strengthening of the research base in this area.The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Engineering Professorship and Lectureship Programme, which was launched in 2007, is an important step in meeting this objective. The programme aims to increase the number of world-class, research active professors and lecturers in engineering disciplines in Irish HEIs. The programme requires a minimum cost share contribution of 20% of SFI direct costs from industry sponsors and is designed to allow more flexible and proactive recruiting by HEIs of key research personnel in any field of engineering. Furthermore, it should assist the HEIs to develop new links, and strengthen existing interactions, with industry.In December 2007, SFI awarded funding for 6 Lectureships and 3 Professorships across UCC, UCD, NUIG and TCD with a total value of  €5.5m including industry sponsorship. To date 2 Professorship and 3 Lectureship positions have been filled and the recruitment process for the other posts is ongoing.SFI remains committed to the recruitment of academics in the field of engineering, therefore, the Engineering Professorship and Lectureship Programme will be integrated into future calls of the SFI Stokes Professorship and Lectureship Programme.

There is no requirement under the Act to report to Government, or to the Registrar of Credit Unions, on the amounts held in these special funds or the exact projects or charitable purposes supported by these funds or the individual amounts paid out.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that I am not, therefore, in a position to answer his question.My Department has, however, been in contact with the CEO of the Irish League of Credit Unions who has confirmed that he would be happy to update the Deputy on Section 44 activity carried out by credit unions affiliated to the League.

Representatives of the sector have indicated that some participants will face a very challenging position in 2009.The Finance Act 2006 provided that bookmakers are solely liable for the Betting Duty. Subsequent to the Budget announcement, I have met a wide range of representatives from the betting industry where the problems faced by the sector, including those arising from the Budgetary changes, were discussed. I will bear these in mind in the context of the Finance Bill.

If a bookmaker were to establish an on-line betting operation within the State, the bookmaker would be liable to pay betting duty. In general, however, the charge to pay duty does not apply to on-line betting because virtually all providers of such a service are based outside the State. A similar scenario occurs in the case of bets carried out by telephone. This is not unusual since these types of operations tend to locate in jurisdictions that have extremely low levels of taxation.

Section 905(2)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that an authorised officer may at all reasonable times enter any premises or place where the authorised officer has reason to believe that any trade, profession or other activity, the profits or gains of which are chargeable to tax, is or has been carried on, or any records relating to any trade, profession, other source of profits or gains or chargeable gains, or any tax liability, is or has been located.  Records include till journal rolls and staff rosters.  Section 912(2) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 deals with data equipment such as cash registers.  It provides that records applies to both the records and the data equipment together with any associated software, data, apparatus or material.Regulation 3(c) of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Regulations 2008 [Statutory Instrument 238 of 2008 effective from 2 July 2008] was introduced this year to remove any ambiguity there may have been in relation to the requirement to retain till journal rolls.  It provides that an accountable person who makes sales to unregistered persons using an electronic cash register or point of sale system must retain an up to date and complete daily total of the consideration receivable together with records of each entry on the system uniquely identified by sequential number, date and time of such entry.Revenue's administration is based on self-assessment principles, which in turn relies heavily on the concept of voluntary compliance.  As with any self-assessment system, it must be adequately policed, and Revenue must be effective in identifying and punishing evasion.  Voluntary compliance is undermined if Revenue is not seen to be protecting the honest taxpayer from the non-compliant taxpayer.  Revenue's programmes are geared to improving the level of compliance through interventions aimed at identified areas of risk and to give reassurance to compliant taxpayers that every taxpayer will pay their fair share.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that visits by their officers are carried out in a professional and discreet manner with minimal disruption to the business of the taxpayer. Consideration is given to ensure that visits are not carried out during peak business hours.  I am not aware of any specific issues raised by business representatives.  On the contrary, representatives from the Small Firms Association were recently very positive regarding the work of the Revenue Commissioners in the course of an appearance before a Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs.  However if the Deputy has a specific case in mind the Revenue Commissioners will be happy to look into it.

It is not possible therefore to provide the information requested by the Deputy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The European Investment Bank (EIB) announced on 3 October 2008 that it was increasing its support for Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help mitigate the effects of the current credit crisis.  This is to take the form of a €30 billion facility to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks.I understand that the EIB has had discussions with a number of Irish banks about participation in the facility.  Participation in the facility is, in the first instance, a commercial decision for individual financial institutions, who will be responsible for evaluating loan applications submitted by individual SMEs.This is a very welcome initiative by the EIB and I would strongly urge Irish financial institutions to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding involved available to SMEs as soon as possible.More generally, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Ms Mary Coughlan, TD, has primary responsibility for enterprise development, including supports for SMEs.With regard to the National Treasury Management Agency, the primary role of the Agency is to ensure that sufficient funding is available at all times to meet the day-to-day requirements of the Exchequer.  I would not envisage extending the role of the Agency to providing finance for small and medium businesses as this role is more appropriate to the commercial lending institutions.

The details of the contract were negotiated between the Agency and the company concerned.  I am advised that the company was retained for an initial fee of €2 million to exclusively advise the Government over the two year period of the contract.  This fee should be considered in the context of covered institutions paying fees of €1 billion over the period of the guarantee.  The Deputy will appreciate that any advice received by me under this contract would be extremely commercially and market sensitive and will not be published.This work differs considerably from the work by the other company referred to which has been carrying out a review for the Financial Regulator of the credit risk and lending profiles of the covered financial institutions from a prudential perspective.

Correspondence has been ongoing for some time between the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the solicitors for the applicant in respect of a discretionary waiver to the applicant of part of the deceased's estate to the applicant.The solicitors for the applicant, on behalf of the applicant, have made an application to the Chief State Solicitor's Office to discharge all his client's expenses and his legal fees.  This application exceeds the value of the deceased's estate.  At all times the Chief State Solicitor's Office have informed the solicitors for the applicant that any payment with regard to his client's expenses will be made on an ex-gratia basis and that legal expenses in processing an application for waiver in respect of an escheated estate are not allowed.The solicitors for the applicant provided services for his client on a private basis and they do not have any legal claim with regard to their professional fees against the Chief State Solicitor's Office or the Minister, neither can their legal fees be considered as a debt against the deceased's estate.In order to make a decision with regard to discharging the applicant's expenses, the Chief State Solicitor's Office require that these be duly vouched.  Some items listed in the applicant's list of expenses have not been vouched to date and therefore no decision has yet been made in regard to a waiver.  The discharge of any expenses, which should be reasonable and fully vouched, will be considered as soon as vouchers in respect of all expenses are made available.

These objectives, including objectives relating to the provision of services to the general public, were part of a modernisation plan approved in advance by the PVG and monitored by it over the course of the Agreement.  Thus, the relevant objectives, and performance generally in relation to the provision of services to our customers, were scrutinised over a period of years by the PVG and met with their satisfaction.  While the Department was not required to conduct a similar exercise under Benchmarking, I am satisfied, in light of the PVG exercise in recent years, with the quality of the services provided by our staff, whether to the general public or otherwise.

No specific Revenue information on the cost of the scheme is available for the tax year 2003 or previous years.Based on the information that has been received and collated to date for the tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the total amount of tax relief claimed was €82.3 million with an estimated tax cost of €34 million.  The following table gives details of number of claims, amount of capital allowances and Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax foregone for the construction of nursing homes for each of the years 2004 to 2006.ClaimsCapital AllowancesExchequer Cost€m€m200428716.67.0200549830.312.4200653835.414.6I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that data for the tax year 2007 is not yet available as the appropriate income tax and corporation tax returns for that year are either not yet due for filing (by 17 November 2008 in the case of returns filed via ROS) or have only recently been filed but have not yet been processed.

It is expected that the permanent office in Newcastlewest will be completed by the end of this year.  The Revenue Commissioners do not anticipate any difficulty in filling the full quota of fifty (50) staff in Newcastlewest.

They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised in respect of both these years.It should also be noted that year-on-year projected increases in the number of income earners over 65 paying income tax cannot be said to be directly attributable to the level of the age exemption thresholds.  There are a number of other factors which are likely to affect these numbers, such as wage, salary and pension growth and demographic changes.The age exemption thresholds have increased by almost 54% since 2002.  This is substantially ahead of wage growth and inflation increases for the same period.

However, wherei. such individual or such individual's spouse is a proprietary director of a company; that individual is obliged to submit a tax return without being requested to do so by an inspector of taxes; orii. such individual has opened, either directly or indirectly, a foreign bank account, then he or she is obliged to submit a tax return without being requested to do so by an inspector of taxes for the tax years in which such account was opened.A proprietary director is a director of a company who is the beneficial owner of, or is able either directly or indirectly to control, more than 15% of the ordinary share capital of the company.(b) Taxpayers with income, or a source of income, in addition to PAYE IncomeAn individual who has non-PAYE income is obliged to submit, under the self-assessment system, a tax return even if not requested to do by an inspector of taxes.Notwithstanding this, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for administrative ease, where a PAYE taxpayer(i) has gross non-PAYE income of less than €50,000 which results in net taxable income of less than €3,174 in a tax year; and(ii) the tax due on that non-PAYE income is collected by reducing the individual's tax credits,  that individual need only submit a tax return when requested to do by notice in writing by an inspector of taxes.The €50,000 limit applies to gross income from all sources and not from each separate source.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	576	After the introduction of the restriction of tax reliefs measure was announced in Budget 2006, my predecessor received a number of representations regarding the inclusion of the donations scheme in the list of reliefs to which the restriction would apply. The arguments put forward were considered very carefully at the time.  The question was also discussed in the Dáil in some detail during Committee Stage of the 2006 Finance Bill.  In the event, my predecessor decided that, on balance, the donations scheme should remain on the list.Removing the donations scheme from the list of specified reliefs would weaken the intended effect of the restriction, which is to increase to 20% at least, in any one year, the effective tax rate of those on high incomes who avail of such reliefs.  Given that the proportion, even of high income individuals, who are affected by the restriction is relatively small, it is expected that the socio-economic objectives of the donations scheme will still be met.  In addition, it should be noted that where relief under the donations scheme has not been allowed in any one year as a result of the restriction, it can be carried forward to the next year and indeed, following years, if necessary.It would be difficult to make any accurate assessment or estimate of the kind suggested by the Deputy.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	577	General labelling is currently governed by Directive 2000/13/EC, which makes compulsory the indication of particulars of the place of origin or provenance only where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff.  Under Article 18 of the Directive, national provisions can only be justified on grounds of the protection of public health, the prevention of fraud or unfair competition, and protection of property rights and indications of provenance.  The member state, when attempting to introduce regulations in this area, must then receive a positive opinion from the European Commission.In the Commission's proposal on the provision of food information to the consumer, issued in January 2008, a similar provision is made.  In addition, however, allowance is made for a voluntary national measure, with mandatory requirements.  Where a Food Business Operator chooses to use country of origin labelling, Article 35 of the proposal states that "where the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food is not the same as the one of its primary ingredient(s), the country of origin or place of provenance of those ingredient(s) shall also be given”. It adds that, “for meat, other than beef and veal, the indication on the country of origin or place of provenance may be given as a single place only where animals have been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.  In other cases information on each of the different places of birth, rearing and slaughter shall be given.”
Ireland submitted its position paper on the Food Information proposal on 5 November 2008.  In this proposal, Ireland pressed for mandatory country of origin labelling for all foodstuffs.  Ireland suggested that, for meat, information be also given regarding the country of birth, rearing and slaughter (where different from the country of origin).  Department of Health and Children will continue to pursue this issue through the EU Working Group charged with developing the proposal.  It is expected that the proposal will not be finalised until at least late 2009.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	578	Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, a person will pay a contribution towards their care costs of up to 80% of assessable income and up to 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum.  In the case of the principal private residence, the contributions payable will be capped at 15%, i.e. after three years of care a person will not be liable for any further contribution based on the principal private residence.Contributions based on Irish land-based assets may be deferred for the duration of a person's lifetime and repaid from their estate.  However, this deferred contribution element of the scheme is voluntary.  Individuals may choose to pay as they go in which case no money would be repayable from their estate.As is the case with the current Nursing Home Subvention Scheme, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill contains an anti-avoidance provision whereby assets and income transferred within the five years prior to an application for State support are to be taken into account during the course of the financial assessment.  Notwithstanding this, the Bill does provide for a right of appeal to have assets and income which were transferred prior to 9 October 2008 excluded from the financial assessment where their inclusion would result in undue hardship for the person, their spouse or partner, or their child under the age of 21.Finally, it should be noted that no existing resident in a nursing home will be made worse off as a result of the new scheme.  Existing residents in public nursing homes can continue to pay in-patient charges while existing residents in private nursing homes can either transfer to the new scheme or remain in receipt of nursing home subvention.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	580	The Government recently announced the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to the medical card from people aged 70 years and over and the introduction of new income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over of €700 (gross) per week for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week for a couple with effect from 1st January, 2009.As part of the means test, any savings up to €36,000 (single)/€72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes. Where a person's means are in excess of the income thresholds, the HSE may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for himself/herself and any dependants.

As the HSE has its own Vote expenditure on the plan must be in line with the Estimates by the Government for that year for the HSE Vote.The service plan must be drawn up in accordance with a wide range of criteria, including having regard to the Executive's 3 year corporate plan which sets out its key objectives and the strategies to achieve and measure the implementation of these objectives.Voluntary hospitals are funded in accordance with Section 38 of the Act which provides that the Executive may enter into an arrangement with service providers.  Before entering into an arrangement the Executive must determine, in respect of a financial year of the Executive, the maximum amount of funding that it proposes to make available in that year under the arrangement and the level of service it expects to be provided for that funding.The 2004 Act, through the provisions for the corporate plan, provides for a multi-annual planning framework. However, in line with the Constitutional requirements regarding the sanctioning of Votes by the Dail, the Act does provide for budgets to be determined annually, within the context of the 3 year corporate plan and having regard to the resources made available to the HSE.Specifically in relation to Capital Expenditure, the HSE submits a 5 year plan multi-annual Capital Plan. This Plan is in line with the annual figures for Capital Expenditure indicated in the Public Capital Programme. This Capital Plan is approved by me. Actual expenditure by the HSE in any one year must be within the overall limits Voted by the Dail on an annual basis.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	589	With effect from the 1st January 2009, new income thresholds will apply for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over.  The thresholds are €700 (gross) per week for a single person and €1400 (gross) per week for a couple.  It is expected that 95% of those aged 70 or over (about 330,000 out of 353,000) will get a medical card under the new arrangements announced by the Government.Over 1.3 million people in the State currently have a medical card.  The objective of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme is to ensure that the medical card benefit is available to those who are unable without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves and their dependants.  I am satisfied that the Government decision to remove the automatic eligibility to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over with effect from 1st January 2009 is an effective measure to ensure that public health funding is used to help those most in need.

The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties. In 2007, the HSE Vote included almost €37 million in baseline funding for these services and the Executive has advised that this figure is available again in 2008. This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to provide the information sought by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Following the publication by a Sub-Committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children of its Report on the Adverse Side Effects of Pharmaceuticals in April 2007, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) initiated a process to carefully examine the various items raised. This process involved the appointment of independent external consultants and experts in the field of pharmacovigilance and drug safety who have conducted a robust assessment of the proposals.  This assessment was completed in November 2007.I am advised that the proposals concerning conduct of clinical trials and post authorisation studies are already provided for in legislation and are the subject of a range of initiatives. One such initiative is a European Medicines Agency project to establish a European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) to look at ways of establishing studies in the various member states and enhancing the sharing of study data across the EU. The IMB's intensive involvement with the Agency and European medicines regulation ensures our full engagement with this initiative and access to all resultant patient safety information.Regarding Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) reporting, a number of items highlighted in the Sub-Committee's report reflected submissions made by the IMB and the consultant's assessment drew attention to the following opportunities which are currently being progressed by the IMB—further development of stakeholder education strategy to include safety issues across the organisation,expanding the current IMB adverse reaction education and awareness programme to a wider healthcare professional base, members of the public and to enhance the profile of the topic in the media,targeted campaign focused on improving awareness of adverse reaction reporting among health professionals and the public,the publication of high level adverse reaction data.The Sub-Committee's report referred to the need to increase the reporting of ADRs.  In response to this, the IMB has developed a website which has the capacity to take on-line reporting of adverse reaction reports.  This system has been fully operational in 2008 and reports are being taken from both health care professionals and patients.  The website can be accessed at;http://www.imb.ie/EN/Safety--Quality/Online-Forms/Human-Medicine-Adverse-Drug-Reaction.aspxWith regard to the establishment of a patient safety agency as recommended by the Sub-Committee, in January 2007, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the healthcare system.The Commission's Report — ‘Building a Culture of Patient Safety' was published on 7th August 2008.  The report contains 134 recommendations spanning across almost every area of the health service including a number relating to the reporting, managing and learning from adverse events in the health system generally.  It also made recommendations in the area of medication safety which are being addressed by the Irish Medicines Board and other bodies with a stake in the medication sector.I will be submitting proposals to Government in the near future arising from the report of the Commission.

One of the conditions of funding under both Programmes is that successful applicants operate high standards of governance. Included in these standards is the requirement that they must have the appropriate legal status to enable them to operate properly. When a group is incorporated as a company, it has a legal identity or status. It can carry out activities in its own name e.g. employ people, borrow money, buy or lease property, take or defend legal proceedings. This means that members are protected from being personally liable for the activities or debts of the company.It is accepted that the procedures that must be taken in order to become incorporated require the services of a solicitor or an accountant and, therefore, are likely to involve expense. Any such costs incurred are eligible expenses and, as such, can be recouped by the applicant under the Programmes.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €90 per calendar month (€100 from 1 January 2009) towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.

Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (Category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health services.  Persons in Category 1 are entitled to a full range of services including, inter alia, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services.  Persons in Category 2 are also entitled, inter alia, to these services, but subject to statutory charges.However, where a patient opts for private treatment, they have moved outside the public system and any fees charged are a private contractual arrangement between the patient and the care provider(s).My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to arrange to have the particular case investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The launch of the National Recreation Policy in September 2007 highlighted Government's commitment to the development of youth cafés.As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth cafés in operation around the country.  Funding for these existing initiatives is often provided through the local City/County Council and the Health Service Executive.  In addition the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs operates a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.At this stage, the focus of my Office is to bring greater coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying appropriate models for the future development of youth cafés.  Since September 2007 my Office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing cafés looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people.  Following that survey the National Children's Advisory Council (NCAC) was requested to advise on the development of a youth café model.  Research was carried out by the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) and a draft report has been forwarded to me recently for my consideration.  This work will ensure that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth cafés which meet the needs of young people themselves.  It will also ensure that any funding that may be available will augment without displacing existing inter-agency resources.  The NUIG has also been requested to prepare a toolkit and guide to support groups setting up youth cafés.  This will be a "how to" guide which will deal with issues such as guiding principles, practical operational matters and provide advice and tips on the day to day management and ongoing development of a café as well as setting up cafes.I intend to bring forward a proposal to Cabinet regarding the development of a youth cafe programme before the end of the year based on the work to date.  I intend publishing both the NCAC report and the Guide as part of advancing the youth cafe programme.  Preparatory work on the publication of the NCAC report is already underway.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Since the establishment of the Health Service Executive, the role of my Department has changed to a stronger policy and performance evaluation role.  The Department's role is focused on ensuring that health services are delivered in accordance with Government policy, and thus involves more direct interaction with agencies and other service providers than with the general public.However, benchmarking has provided impetus to a broad process of modernisation in my Department, which is still ongoing.  Staff have committed to flexibility and to stable industrial relations.Central to the modernisation process is a need to become more focussed on results.  Our Business Plans already include clearly itemised objectives, along with delivery dates and Key Performance Indicators.  We are working to refine this process to increase the clarity of delivery dates, and to improve the level and clarity of prioritisation, including the identification of a smaller number of core priorities, which should facilitate rapid and accurate response in terms of reports for senior management and for me as Minister.  These changes are being applied to Business Plans from 2009.  We have bedded in our Risk Management system, including a live Risk Register.  Crucially, we have integrated the Risk Management system with our Business Planning system, so that risk becomes one of the factors that defines priority within Business Plans.In addition to our "full" format Business Plans, we have continued for 2008 with the production and publication of a Corporate Business Plan, which sets out in a clearly, easily digestible fashion the Department's Mission and Role, along with a tabular statement of Key Outputs and Performance Indicators.We have implemented an updated Correspondence Tracking system, which will allow the tracing of relevant correspondence received in the Department, and the path that it takes internally thereafter.We have identified Staff Training as a critical element in building our capacity to discharge our remit, and as a way of driving change and further elements of modernisation.Staff have already, and are continuing to, co-operate fully with and support the above range of modernisation measures.  I would stress that modernisation is not something that I envisage ever being finished, or stopping, but is rather an ongoing process which is critical if any organisation is to maintain its responsiveness and its ability to meet the needs of those it services.The Department has supported me in implementing a demanding legislation programme.  Additional proposed legislation has already been announced.

The thresholds were selected on the basis of EU-SILC income distribution tables, updated to the present year.  These tables have been made available to Opposition parties.  It is expected that 95% (or 19 out of 20) of those aged 70 or over will continue to hold a medical card under the new arrangements announced by the Government.The income thresholds for the over 70s medical card will be reviewed annually to take account of the increases in average industrial earning over the lifetime of this Government and it is expected that 19 out of 20 persons aged 70 and over will continue to qualify for medical cards into the future.In addition, the Health Service Executive (HSE) provide figures to my Department each month on the number of persons with medical cards and GP visit cards.  My Department monitors these figures on an ongoing basis and will continue to keep the position under review.Where a person aged 70 and over does not qualify for a medical card after 1st January 2009 by virtue of their gross income being over the thresholds mentioned above, the HSE may grant a medical card or a G.P. visit card under the existing net income thresholds of €302 per week for a single person and €447 per week for a couple after mortgage/rent, medical, nursing and other expenses are taken into account.  This is to allow for the possibility that a person's net income may yet qualify them for a medical card or G.P. visit card even though their gross income is above the proposed new limits.  The Government considers it important that this option should be available to persons aged 70 and over.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	615	Data on mortality are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and submitted to Eurostat, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the purposes of standard international indicators.  Comparable health information at international level is essential in monitoring and prioritising health issues and in measuring our performance. My Department is actively involved in a number of initiatives at EU and international level to improve the range and comparability of indicators across the health sector.International mortality data allows detailed comparison by cause of death, age, sex etc.  Over the past decade, these data show very dramatic reductions in mortality in Europe but especially in Ireland.  Between 1997 and 2005, mortality rates here fell by 27% compared with a 13% average reduction across the EU.  The decline in deaths from diseases of the circulatory system has been particularly dramatic with falls of 40% for both ischaemic heart disease and stroke compared with an EU average of 20% for both conditions.  These improvements are reflected in very considerable gains in life expectancy which have seen Ireland go from more than 2 years below average EU life expectancy in 1997 to more than a year above it in 2005.  Total life expectancy for men and women combined has now reached 80 years of age.In referring to amenable causes of death, I presume the Deputy is alluding to research carried out by Drs. Ellen Nolte and Martin McKee in 2003 and updated earlier this year. This attempts to identify causes of death which may be particularly amenable to health service intervention. The earlier work refers to data for 1997/8 while the update refers to data for 2002/3.   The research shows the potential value of the methodology but also highlights a number of difficulties in interpretation of results.  The concept of amenable causes has not been adopted by international organisations as a basis for international comparisons.  Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that while Ireland was in the lower ranking group of countries along with Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Portugal, it showed the highest rate of improvement (23%) in mortality from amenable causes of all OECD countries between 1997 and 2002.  There is no doubt that more recent data (as indicated above) will confirm this trend.

Any additional cost would be offset by reductions in costs associated with staff on higher scales being replaced by staff on lower scales.  This would come about through staff movements, retirements and resignations.The administration of incremental pay increases in the agencies under the remit of my Department is a day-to-day matter for the agencies concerned.  My Department has no role or function in this process and does not provide funding for these costs.

The NCIP has an allocation of €575 million, and is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places.The information requested is listed in the following table. There were 40 applications for funding in 2008 under the NCIP from applicants in County Clare.  The number of places to be provided, based on funding approved, is broken down into part-time, full-time and sessional places.  Funding is based on places to be provided rather than the number of children using the service.  More than one child may avail of a childcare place due to the sessional and part-time nature of some childcare services. The level of funding is determined by the number of places the group proposes to provide and criteria based on local need and sustainability of the project.Applications Received: Clare — 2008Applicant Name/ Facility Name:Applicant Type:Funding Type:Staus of Application:Approved (if applicable):Places (Projected):SessionalPart-timeFull-timeClare Family Resource Centre/ NCIP Clare Family Resource CentreCBCapitalApproved200,000.00302740CurrentApproved122,374.00Naionra Dun Beg / NCIP Naionra Dun BegCBCurrentApproved10,000.002600West Clare Early Years Care and Education Services Limited / NCIP West Clare Early Years Care and Education Service (6 services)CBCurrentApproved139,089.001275678Kilmaley Preschool Childcare Playgroup / NCIP Kilmaley Preschool Childcare PlaygroupCBCurrentApproved33,636.00201420Ennis West Partners/ NCIP Ennis Traveller Afterschool ClubCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending3500Tiny Tots Limited/ NCIP Tiny Tots CrecheCBCurrentAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.0015150Stone Court Residents Association / Childcare Sub-Committee / NCIP Stone Court Residents Association / Childcare Sub-CommitteeCBCurrentApproved31,785.000400Burren Sonas Group / NCIP Burren Sonas GroupCBCurrentApproved16,560.002000Madeline Rouine/ NCIP Réaltaí BeagaSECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.001535Loughgraney Kids Corner Limited / NCIP Lough Graney Community PlaygroupCBCurrentApproved75,530.00302016Sixmilebridge and District Community Complex Society Ltd / NCIP Sixmilebridge and District Community Complex Society LtdCBCurrentApproved11,250.00202351Applicant Name/ Facility Name:Applicant Type:Funding Type:Staus of Application:Approved (if applicable):Places (Projected):SessionalPart-timeFull-time€Obair Newmarket-on-Fergus Ltd. / NCIP Obair Newmarket-on-Fergus Ltd.CBCurrentApproved61,144.00164642CLASS Ltd / NCIP CLASS LtdCBCurrentApproved33,638.0004060County Clare VEC/ NCIP Kilrush Creche — Adult Education CentreCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending02035CapitalApproved95,957.00CapitalDeclined0.00Lisdoonvarna Failte Ltd/ NCIP Lisdoonvarna Community CrecheCBCapitalApproved66,114.0001535CurrentApproved23,000.00Midlands School of Childcare Ltd/ NCIP Woodhaven Montessori & Childcare AcademySECapitalDeclined0.00402627Liscannor Childcare Service/ NCIP Liscannor Childcare ServiceCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending20200Cooleenbridge Ltd. / NCIP Raheen Wood Childcare ProjectCBCurrentApproved19,241.00183636CapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.00Killaloe Community Development Co Ltd/ NCIP An Sean ScoilCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending01535Scoil Mhainchin/ NCIP Scoil MhainchinCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending2400Clare Haven Childcare Service/ NCIP Clare Haven Childcare ServiceCBCurrentApproved48,500.003200Little Acorns PreSchool/Montessori/ NCIP Little Acorns PreSchool/Montessori (St. Senan’s)CBCurrentApproved0.004000CurrentApproved0.00Applicant Name/ Facility Name:Applicant Type:Funding Type:Staus of Application:Approved (if applicable):Places (Projected):SessionalPart-timeFull-time€Helen Moore Christine Shanahan/ NCIP Smart Start ChildcareSECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.0010014SeanCahir/ NCIP Tir na NogSECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.000614TinaO’Brien/ NCIP Free SpiritsSECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.000160Footsteps Childcare Ltd./ NCIP Footsteps Childcare Ltd.SECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.0002039Rachel Killeen/ NCIP Rachel KilleenSECapitalAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.0010100Clougheigh Community Playgroup/ NCIP Clougheigh Community PlaygroupCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending4000Clarecastle Community Playgroup/ NCIP Clarecastle Community PlaygroupCBCurrentApproved (Indicatively)Pending12240Adult and Community Education Centre / NCIP Cuain Aire CrecheCBCurrentApproved87,620.0001040Mol an Óige agus Tiocfaidh Sí Teoranta Before and After School Care/ NCIP Mol an Óige agus Tiocfaidh Sí Teoranta Before and After School CareCBCurrentAwaiting Notification of Final Decision0.000250Ennistymon Family Resource Centre / NCIP Ennistymon Family Resource CentreCBCurrentApproved32,863.008026Ruan Community Childcare Ltd. / NCIP Ruan Community Childcare Ltd.CBCurrentApproved31,741.0025105Inagh Development Company Ltd. / NCIP Inagh Development Company LtdCBCurrentApproved28,575.0002042633557660Key:CB: 1 Community Based Provider.SE: Private Provider.Approved (Indicatively): Application approved in principle but yet to complete pre-contract process.Sessional: A place available up to and including 3.5 hours per day.Part-time: 1 A place available from 3 hours 31 minutes up to and including 5 hours per day.Full-time: A place available for more than 5 hours per day in a facility notified as full-time by the HSE.

The Report recommends inter alia that a plan to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals should be drawn up and implemented and that the resources released by these closures should be protected for reinvestment in the mental health service.  It is understood that the Health Service Executive (HSE) has disposed of a small number of assets since the launch of the Report in January 2006.As the HSE has primary responsibility for implementing this recommendation, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issues raised by the Deputy.  Therefore, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

In relation to cervical cancer specifically, my immediate responsibility is to women in Ireland who have already been exposed to HPV and who may already have precancerous changes or undetected cervical cancer. Vaccination is a long term investment which will only be offset by improved health outcomes and treatment savings in 15 to 30 years in the future. All of the clinical advice available to me suggests that investment in the national roll-out of the cervical screening programme should be my number one priority. The National Cervical Screening Programme, CervicalCheck is being fully implemented this year at a full year cost of €35m.I am fully committed to keeping the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme under active review in future funding decisions as we proceed to implement the National Cancer Programme.

Sub Report One: Learning about sex and first sexual experiences;2. Sub Report Two: Sexual health challenges and related service provision;3. Sub Report Three: Sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviours-a further analysis.The reports provide a very detailed analysis of the research data, including the following findings:Nearly one third of men and a fifth of women, aged 18 to 24, had sex before they were 17: these young people were more likely to report that they regretted this decision when compared to those who waited until they were older.Men and women who may have left school early were more likely to experience first sex before age 17. Men with secondary-level qualifications are three times more likely than those with a third-level qualification to report experience of first sex before age 17.There were no differences in use of alcohol or drugs between those who had sex before 17 and those who had sex after 17.Those who had sex before 17 were approximately half as likely to use contraception at first sex, compared to those waited until they were older.The findings of the reports have been used to inform policy development and service delivery within the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, as follows:In June of this year the Department of Health and Children and the Education and Prevention Sub-Committee of the National Aids Strategy Committee published a HIV and AIDS Education and Prevention Plan for the period 2008-2012.The Crisis Pregnancy Agency is currently devising a campaign targeting young people with a central theme of delaying first sex. This campaign will build on the extensive work programme of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency in this area and will be launched in 2009.Finally, 362 new HIV infections were diagnosed during 2007 and reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.

Where it is not possible to reach agreement on transfer to local authorities, the option of sale of the harbours will be considered.  In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, consideration will be given to bringing such harbours under the control of a port company.Four harbour authorities (Annagassan, Dingle, Sligo and River Moy) have already ceased to exist in accordance with the above policy and the harbours concerned have been transferred to relevant local authorities. In addition, Dingle has been designated as a Fisheries Harbour Centre.For over three years now, my Department has been funding remedial works at the regional harbours, including Arklow, at an average cost of approximately €4m per annum pending the transfer of the harbours to local control.As there is no longer any significant commercial traffic at Arklow Harbour, it is scheduled for transfer to local authority control in due course.

All such documents are, of course, considered in the development of transport proposals.In the Meath and surrounding areas, Transport 21, the Government's ten-year financial framework for investment in transport infrastructure, provides for a number of important projects, including the M3 and the Navan rail line, which will enhance the public transport options for people travelling to or from the county.The M3 motorway from Clonee to North of Kells is currently under construction and due for completion in 2010.  Construction of phase one of the Navan rail line from Clonsilla to Pace is now underway and has a target completion date of 2010 also. Iarnród Éireann is currently studying route options in respect of the second phase which will extend the line from Pace to Navan.My Department is also in the process of completing a Sustainable Transport and Travel Action Plan that will, among other things, address the measures necessary to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.

In severe rainfall, heavy fog or snow, when visibility is poor, the operating range may be reduced.I am also informed that when the LTI 20-20 Ultralyte handheld speed detection device is being used offending motorists must be stopped by the detecting Garda as this device does not capture or retain an image of offending vehicles. In severe weather conditions operation of this speed detection device may not be safe for Garda personnel and motorists because of the extended vehicle stopping distances necessary due to road conditions associated with severe rainfall, heavy fog or snow.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	644	Officials in the Citizenship Section of my Department inform me that there is no record of applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy's Question.The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must—be of full age;be of good character;have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; andhave made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include—periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State;periods granted for the purposes of study; andperiods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.It is open to the persons concerned to lodge applications for certificates of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements applicable at that time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I am informed that in response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report the Courts Service has implemented a number of key initiatives which address issues raised in it. These initiatives include the nationwide deployment of the Criminal Case Tracking System (CCTS) to all District Court offices in 2004. This System, which records the history of criminal cases from date of first court hearing to finalisation, facilitates the collection and production of improved management information in relation to the fines process. The Courts Accounting System (CAS), which processes fine receipts, was piloted in 2007, and by end of 2008 it will have been deployed in 28 District Court Offices including all major urban centres. The system will be fully deployed by mid 2009. It provides a facility for payment of fines on line which has proven to be very successful and is increasing compliance.There have been significant benefits from these two strategic systems, including better management information on the collection of fines, more payment options, including the online payment facility, and more timely issue of fines notices and reminders.In 2007 the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a follow up report on fines collection and found that the payment rate had increased from 55% to 66%. I am confident that the above initiatives, some of which were not in place at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's original report, will further contribute to an increase in the payment rate.I am further informed that as part of the latest upgrade to the Garda Pulse system applications for summonses by the Gardaí will be electronically routed to CCTS, which will issue summonses and electronically notify the Gardaí through Pulse of the court date and the outcome in due course. This will result in savings to both organisations as well as enhancements to the accuracy of the Garda criminal records system.The Fixed Charge Processing System (FCPS) now covers the most significant offences in terms of road safety. These include speeding, driving without insurance, non-wearing of safety belts, careless driving and using a mobile phone while driving. In April 2006, the system was integrated with the Pulse system, enabling the linking of offences so that applications for a single summons for a number of offences can be generated. FCPS has significantly enhanced management information and consequently the ability to monitor performance by reference to targets, timeliness and enforcement. Fixed charge notices are being issued in a timely fashion with a file of newly recorded incidents being sent electronically on a daily basis to an external service provider who prints and issues notices the same day. As a result of these developments, monitoring of the operation of FCPS has been much improved, thereby enabling An Garda Síochána to agree efficiency indicator targets including spoilage rates, the timeliness of the issue of notices and follow up to non-payment.I am also informed that it is intended, following a call for expressions of interest, to outsource the collection of overdue court imposed fines with an option to extend this to fixed charge notices at a later date. A detailed Request for Tender will issue to the candidates shortlisted in the near future.I intend to seek Government approval for a Fines Bill which will provide for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine. These proposals would result in an increased level of payment of fines.

When not participating in specific intelligence led operations, the Unit carries out armed patrols in the city and its environs concentrating on targeted areas of the city.I am informed by the Garda authorities that 626 Gardaí are attached to Limerick Division, with 488 or 78% of the Divisional personnel based in the two Garda Districts. In the last year alone, there has been a 12% increase in Garda numbers in Limerick city, and a 40% increase since 2003.As well as a high and unceasing level of policing activity, community policing is a very important part of the Garda response and such units have been increased in strength in Limerick. Since January 2006, Community Policing Units throughout the city have been increased by two Inspectors, five Sergeants and 60 Gardaí. Community policing plays an important high visibility role in policing all areas of the city, including the areas where those suspected of involvement in criminal activity reside.All available resources within Limerick City, supplemented by personnel and expert support from the units within National Support Services including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, are being utilised to target organised crime groups and in particular the investigation into the murder referred to. The Emergency Response Unit has also been deployed to Limerick Division.The work of An Garda Síochána is underpinned by an extensive range of legislation and I would mention specifically in this context the proposals which I am bringing forward in relation to covert surveillance.

Furthermore, prisoners identified as exerting undue influence or pressure over other prisoners receive close and continued attention and targeted searching from the now Operational Support Group units.I can advise the Deputy that local intelligence indicates that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of improvised weapons now in the possession of prisoners.

However, during the parliamentary discussions leading up to enactment of the legislation and in response to submissions from organisations representing the mixed trading sector, I gave an undertaking that if the objectives of structural separation could be achieved by means of a voluntary Code of Practice, and provided that implementation of any such Code would be subject to independent audit and verification, I would be prepared to defer implementation of section 9. However, if the process of independent audit and verification indicated that those objectives were not being achieved, I would have no hesitation in commencing section 9.Details of a Code of Practice and its implementation have been the subject of consultations between the organisations representing the mixed trading sector and both my Department and the Department of Health and Children and I expect to be in a position to announce details of the Code and the arrangements for its implementation in the near future.

The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy & Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons, which was launched in May 2006.  Working to fulfil the commitments contained in the Policy and Strategy involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.Currently, any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing positive for opioids on committal is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification for operational reasons.  Patients can, as part of the assessment process, discuss with health care staff other treatment options which may include stabilisation on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Methadone maintenance is available in 8 of the 14 places of detention accounting for over 80% of the prison population. Details of the number of prisoners treated with drug related problems since 2003 are set out in the following table.

Each multidisciplinary programme has a duration of 6 weeks and the programme has a capacity of 9 prisoners at a time. The  programme involves both prison based staff and external agencies and is aimed at assisting prisoners who have indicated a desire to move from either a situation of current drug use or existing substitution programme to drug free status.Education in prisons is delivered by way of partnership between the Irish Prison Service and a range of educational agencies from the community.  Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and Public Library Services make the largest contribution to, and are the mainstay of, the Prison Education Service. The Department of Education and Science provided an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs in the academic year 2007/08.It is estimated that 50% of all prisoners were involved in some education during 2007.  Of the total prison population 25% were intensively involved, i.e. for more than 10 hours per week.  This level of involvement in education whilst in prison is high by international standards.On 17th November, 2008 there were 299 persons in custody serving sentences for sexual offences. The question of treatment for sex offenders in custody is not straightforward. While the weight of opinion is that cognitive-behavioural approaches to the treatment of sexual offenders show the most promise, not all offenders are amenable to such treatment and unless an offender is properly motivated the chances of success are limited.   Even if it were legally possible, there is no gain in forcing offenders to attend such treatment against their will.A Group involving my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service has been established to review the existing arrangements for the management of sex offenders. That review will include the question of treatment and supervision.Three main forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders currently operate within the Irish prison system.  These are as follows:Group programmes, an intensive version of which has been in operation since 1994 and is currently under review,Individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Service, andOne-to-one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.The intensive programme has catered for eight offenders at a time, taking eleven months to complete.  Although delivered in Arbour Hill Prison, it has been available to sex offenders in other prisons. A total of 136 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date.  The most recent group completed the programme in July 2008.As I have advised the House before, the number of suitably motivated offenders applying for participation on the programme has declined significantly in recent years and this has been a matter of increasing concern. Therefore in an attempt to engage more sex offenders in appropriate interventions, the Irish Prison Service has initiated a review of interventions currently available. The review will be completed by the end of the year, with new enhanced models of intervention being introduced in January 2009. The Irish Prison Service is also finalising a new Sex Offender Management Policy which examines the sentence management and resettlement of imprisoned sex offenders.One-to-one counselling is a critical method of working with offenders in relation to their sexual offending.  In response to such counselling many offenders, who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change.  The Probation Service also engages with prisoners on a one-to-one basis.  Every effort continues to be made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in rehabilitation and relapse prevention. Staff levels in the Psychology Service have doubled since 2004 and are now at an all-time high. Further expansion is taking place, with recruitment of one Psychologist and three Psychology Assistants under way.

The average cost is calculated by dividing the annual running costs of the Irish Prison Service by the average daily number of offenders incarcerated during the year. These costs include certain items which are fixed regardless of the number of offenders in custody, e.g. staffing numbers, utilities. In general, capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation in the interests of facilitating comparison between individual institutions. However, certain building projects under the heading ‘small works and environmental projects' are included.

The first Report was issued in June 2002 and a second Report was issued in December 2007. The pay recommendations were based on an evaluation and comparison of the jobs and pay of public servants with jobs of comparable responsibility in the private sector. Under its terms of reference, the Body was required, when reaching its recommendations, to have regard to the need to ensure ongoing modernisation of the public service.The first phase of the Benchmarking increases was implemented retrospectively with effect from 1 December 2001, in accordance with the December 2000 Pay Adjustment to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF). Under the terms of the Social Partnership Agreement 2003-2005 Sustaining Progress, the payment of the final two phases of the Benchmarking increases were dependent on verification of satisfactory progress in regard to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the Agreement, and maintenance of stable industrial relations.The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Sustaining Progress Partnership Agreement and the current Partnership Agreement Towards 2016, have all provided for improvements with respect to the more efficient use of financial, staff and I.T. resources, enhanced customer service, better staff training and development, further development of partnership, regulatory reform and commitments in the area of equality of opportunity.  Comprehensive details of the achievements which have been made in the modernisation programme can be found at www.cspvg.gov.ie.These achievements and their underlying principles have been carried through in the modernisation and change agenda in my Department and its associated offices with consequential benefits for the improvement of services provided to the general public including — (i) Increased accountability and reform of the Garda Síochána through the implementation of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, Garda Inspectorate and joint policing committees at local level. The number of full and part time civilian staff assigned  to An Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2008 has increased to 2,461, thereby releasing  further Gardaí to visible front-line policing duties in the community. (ii) The development of a Financial Shared Services Centre in the Department involving new organisation structures, payment systems, business processes and information technology enabling payroll and other payment services to be provided for other Government Departments. My Department provides the full range of back-office financial services for the Department of Tourism and Sport, Department of the Taoiseach, the National Library, the National Museum and the National Gallery, as well as the Justice Sector. (iii) The establishment of the Irish Youth Justice Service and the publication of a National Youth Justice Strategy aimed at improving co-ordination and strategic linkage of services, especially at local level, to deliver services for children in trouble with the law. (iv) Continued modernisation and reform of the Irish Prison Service (IPS) through the improvement of physical infrastructure, prison procedures and work processes. (v) Re-organisation of the Probation Service towards more focussed delivery of services involving assessment and management of offenders in the community thereby helping to increase public safety. (vi) The volume of business conducted by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) has grown significantly in recent years with a dramatic change from illegal to legal migration. For example, the number of Visa applications has risen from about 50,000 in 2000 to about 150,000 last year. A change management process is in place which involves restructuring of the organisation and redistribution of resources. This is aimed at ensuring that the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill can be implemented effectively once enacted, that major IT projects currently underway are delivered within budget and on time and that service provision  is enhanced across the organisation including improved opening hours and provision of visa application services on-line. (vii) Over the period in question my Department has established a number of dedicated executive offices/ organisations to improve policy co-ordination and service delivery in a number of important areas such as Cosc (the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence), a dedicated Executive Office dealing with the issue of Anti Human -Trafficking and the Private Security Authority.Further details of my Department's Modernisation Action Plans, drawn up under the terms of the social partnership agreements, and the reports of the Civil Service Performance Verification Group (CSPVG) are available at www.cspvg.gov.ie . The role of the CSPVG is to verify progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the Civil Service in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 33 of Towards 2016.

Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the information sought by the Deputy directly to him.

The Garda authorities advise that they are working with the service provider so that rollout of the service to members of the Force will closely follow the provision of this infrastructure.  Accordingly, the rollout is planned to commence in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in April 2009 with full coverage for Dublin in place by August 2009. The Eastern Region is expected to be completed by December 2009 and rollout to the other Garda Regions will take place in line with the agreed infrastructure plans.

I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the spray will be procured in accordance with EU and National Procurement guidelines.  It is anticipated that the spray will then be rolled out to the organisation on a Garda Divisional basis in conjunction with the requisite training programme.The timeline for the programme is currently being developed with a view to completing full rollout, subject to the procurement process, by the end of 2009. The initial phase of the rollout will focus on those Garda Divisions identified as having high instances of assault and obstruction against Gardaí.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that the roll-out of anti-stab/ballistic vests to all operational members of An Garda Síochána has been completed.  A total of 13,180 members or 92% of the organisation have been issued with the vests which are being worn in all Garda Districts.  The provision of vests to personnel assigned to administrative duties and members returning from long term leave such as maternity leave, career breaks etc. is continuing.

I am advised by the Garda Authorities that a number of venues were utilised around the country for the delivery of tactical training and a premises has now been leased in the vicinity of the Garda College to provide an element of tactical training pending the development of more long term facilities at the proposed Dromard Site.  In addition, the Garda Síochána have three Firearms Training Systems available to them. These are portable computer software generated virtual systems which uses real live specially adapted firearms and are currently in use by the  Firearms Training Units attached to the Garda College and Garda Headquarters and at scheduled venues throughout the country.

An official driver is allocated to each vehicle and it is their duty to ensure that routine maintenance is carried out at the appropriate intervals.  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that under Section 3.(5) (d) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2003, (S.I. No 405 of 2003), the Garda Síochána is exempt from the National Car Test (NCT).  In January 2008, the Garda Síochána adopted a policy of voluntarily submitting Garda vehicles which are 4 years and over to a condition check which is carried out by NCT staff.  Thereafter, these vehicles will be conditionally checked every 2 years from the date of the first test.

To date there have been 44 fixed charge notices issued for offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 308 together.Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children. With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 31 October, 2008, 907 behaviour warnings to adults and 548 behaviour warnings to children were issued.  There have also been two formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, agreed.I am further informed that up to 30 September, 2008 there have been six applications made to the Courts for civil orders (adult) and behaviour orders (child) by members of An Garda Síochána. Three of these applications were successful resulting in two behaviour orders and one civil order being issued.  During the period 1 January, 2007 to 31 October, 2008 the Limerick Garda Division issued 41 behaviour warnings to adults and 31 behaviour warnings, three good behaviour contracts and two behaviour orders to children.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to provide the information requested at Garda District level.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the use of spray paints in respect of graffiti offences.In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that section 2(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 creates a simple offence of damaging property without lawful excuse.  Section 4 of the Act creates the offence of having custody or control of anything with intent to cause damage to property.  Both of these offences are punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding €1,270 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. Following conviction on indictment these offences are punishable by a fine not exceeding €12,697 and /or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides that where a Garda, who is in a public place or any other place under a power of entry authorised by law or to which he or she was expressly or implicitly  invited or permitted to be, finds or comes into possession of anything he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that it is evidence of , or relating to, the commission of an arrestable offence, he or she may seize and retain it for use as evidence in any criminal proceedings for such a period from the date of seizure as is reasonable or, if proceedings are commenced in which it is required for use in evidence, until the conclusion of the proceedings.  This section gives Gardaí a power to seize spray cans from young people found in possession of them as the offences listed, contrary  to sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 are arrestable offences.Given that a wide range of material is used to make graffiti, including lipstick, biros, pens and markers, so it is not just paint which can be the problem, I have no proposal to ban the sale of spray paint  as the Deputy has suggested.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I have requested the Garda Inspectorate to examine and report on how the allocation of Garda resources can be improved. This will include an examination of all current resource allocation systems for members of An Garda Síochána, including rostering, to see how well resources are made available to match demand for services and other operational requirements.  The Inspectorate is currently undertaking its examination and I am advised that they expect to report in the new year.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I am informed by the Garda authorities that a new release of PULSE was deployed on the 15 November 2008.  This release includes the upgrading of PULSE to the latest technology platform.  It also provides for electronic integration with the Courts Service whereby applications for summonses by the Gardaí will be electronically routed to the Courts Criminal Case Tracking System, which will in return issue the summons and electronically notify the Gardaí through PULSE of the court date and outcome in due course.  There are efficiency savings for both the Garda and Courts organisations and it will result in increased Garda visibility through minimising court related administrative work.The functionality of the Garda Information System which incorporates both PULSE and the Fixed Charge Processing System is continually upgraded and enhanced to accommodate new business requirements, policies and procedures as well as updates to reflect new legislation.  Also, as with any major IT system, upgrades of the hardware and software are carried out from time to time.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 to 303, inclusive, together.The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme is an initiative first introduced in 1963 to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity.  It is operated by Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers and it has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the Programme.  It should be noted that the Diversion Programme was placed on a statutory footing under the Children Act 2001 and separate annual reports related to its operation for the years 2001 onwards are also published annually.I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of Gardaí operating as Juvenile Liaison Officers on 30 September 2008 was 105.  The Commissioner has approved the appointment of 7 additional Juvenile Liaison Officers each year up to 2010.  As records of the numbers of JLO's prior to 2005 were in manual format the provision of the requested information is not readily available.  The number of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers as at 31st December for the remaining years were as follows:2005: 95;2006: 93;2007: 93.The statistics in relation to the operation of the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme as requested by the Deputy are available as follows: Statistics for 1999 to 2005 are available in An Garda Síochána's Annual Reports on the Garda Website.  Statistics for 2006 are available on the Central Statistics Office's Website.  Statistics for 2007 are not yet published.  Statistics are not provided for the specific number of juveniles referred for aggressive or violent behaviour. Statistics based on the incidence of principal offences in respect of which referrals were made is recorded annually.The Garda Youth Diversion Projects, which are funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service, work in tandem with the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people aged 12-17 years of age who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.  Garda Youth Diversion Projects were first introduced in 1991 and there are currently 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects operating in various locations throughout the country.  Current year funding for these projects is €11,909 million.The projects undertake a series of programmes and activities which are aimed at changing behaviours, attitudes and lifestyles of project participants to bring about positive change and learning outcomes.  The programmes offer opportunities for education, employment training, sport, and other activities while providing a structured environment to add stability and support to a young person's life.  This work is primarily carried out by a project coordinator/youth worker, who operates under the guidance of a project/management committee. While some gardaí work with the projects as part of their day to day activity, the deployment of Gardaí to these projects is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.These projects are managed by committees comprising representatives for An Garda Síochána, representatives from other relevant bodies, for example, Health Services Executive, Probation Service, local school, etc.  In addition to the JLO and Community Gardaí, other local Gardaí, including, where appropriate, Gardaí from specialist units, also get involved in the work of GYDPs.  The Garda Community Relations Section (GCRS) of the Garda National Juvenile Office based in Harcourt Street coordinates the administration of these projects.Statistics in relation to number of participants in the projects for each of the years that the Deputy has requested are not readily available but, in general, each project works with approximately 36 young people annually.  Some projects work with greater numbers and work on a less structured basis while others work intensively with fewer participants.

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Dublin North Central Garda Division as at 30 September 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 712.Local Garda management is aware of the issues raised by the Deputy in the area referred to by him and additional patrols by uniformed and plain clothes personnel, supplemented by Divisional and District Detective and Drug Units, Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units, Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel have been directed to the area.  Four members of the local Community Policing Unit are allocated specifically to the area and these members attend meetings with various Residents' Groups attended also by Local Authority and public representatives.  These meetings are also regularly attended by local Senior Garda management and the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for the Region.A specific initiative, targeting public disorder and other anti-social type behaviour has been commenced by local Garda management in this area.  It incorporates additional patrols being carried out by the Divisional Public Order Unit, particularly between Thursdays and Sundays.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences. Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  The aim is to bring about an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents in the Community.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force.  In doing this he takes into account all relevant factors, including factors such as population, crime rates and trends as well as operational priorities.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the area referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner with the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

The Commission administers the Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance to Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.  Under the Scheme, the Commission makes payments to persons injured, or to the survivors of persons fatally injured, since 1969 as a direct result of the conflict in Northern Ireland, where the injury or death occurred in this jurisdiction or where the victim was normally resident in this jurisdiction at the time of their injury or death.  In addition the Commission makes payments to victim support groups for the purpose of meeting the counselling needs of victims or members of surviving families in this jurisdiction as a direct result of the conflict.  It also assists the provision of memorials and other forms of commemoration.The Remembrance Commission's terms of appointment formally came to an end on 31 October 2008.  In its five years of existence it has dispersed over 6.5 million euros to victims and their families in this jurisdiction, including payments to support groups and the provision of memorials.It is my intention that the long term medical expenses of survivors of such incidents will continue to be provided for.  Consideration is being finalised as to what arrangements should be put in place in relation to other functions exercised by the Remembrance Commission, which included making payments to Justice for the Forgotten.

There no plans at present to change these provisions; however, they are kept under constant review as to their necessity and effectiveness.  As I have indicated to the House previously, ideally we would not like to have legislation such as this but the prevailing circumstances are not ideal.I am awaiting a report from the Garda Síochána in relation to the statistical information sought by the Deputy and will communicate further with him when I have received this.

Section 12 of the Immigration Act 2004 allows members of An Garda Síochána to require a non-national to produce on demand a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality. Members of An Garda Síochána may on occasion need to carry out certain checks in order to confirm a person's identity and citizenship.The Garda Customer Charter outlines the Garda Síochána's commitment to respecting customers and their needs, protecting human rights, and ensuring a caring service approach.

In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003, copies of which are available on the website of the CSO, www.cso.ie.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 September, 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations received on his behalf from his legal representatives for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 10 December 2004, the then Minister refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring him to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 20 January 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present as requested and was classified as evading his deportation.On 28 August 2007, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006. The legal representative of the person concerned was invited to make an application under Regulation 4(2) of the aforesaid Regulations setting out any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned or his country of origin which has arisen since the original decision to deport was made and which related to a possible entitlement to Subsidiary Protection. The said application is currently under consideration within my Department.The enforcement of the Deportation remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned did not submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State within the prescribed time period.As stated in my earlier Reply, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, now falls to be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this consideration has been completed, the file is passed to me for decision.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The Flood Report, which was commissioned by my predecessor, is a seminal study into the needs of Irish Prisoners overseas. It will serve as the template for future Government action in this area for many years to come. On 21 October in the Seanad, I outlined some of the measures we have already taken to implement its key recommendations.One of the principal elements in the Report was the need to quantify the number of Irish prisoners overseas and to establish an up to date register of those Irish imprisoned abroad. The Flood Report also recommended that prisoners overseas should have a visit once a year and more often than that, if circumstances required. Those recommendations have been accepted and the Department has recently begun work to install the appropriate equipment in the Department's IT system. This new software system will allow the Department to compile an electronic register of Irish prisoners overseas and monitor their status.The Report also recommended the establishment of a hardship fund to assist prisoners and their families in cases of particular difficulty. Earlier this year, I provided €30,000 to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas to assist in this respect. This is in addition to the €222,000 provided in core funding for the ICPO.The recommendation that Irish Embassies and Consulates have available lists of English speaking lawyers and provide advice on local legal systems to prisoners and their families has already been implemented.In addition, as recommended in the Flood Report, the Irish Government has recently appointed Honorary Consuls in places where there is no permanent official Irish diplomatic representation, including Agadir in Morocco, Harare in Zimbabwe, Tbilisi in Georgia, Cancun in Mexico, as well as the re-opening of Honorary Consulates Jakarta in Indonesia and Sao Paolo in Brazil.Other issues were also examined by the report, including "miscarriages of justice" and the recommendation that the Government "seek to block forced repatriation to Ireland". Earlier this year, I agreed to the provision of a financial contribution to the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (MOJO), headed by Paddy Hill, one of the former Birmingham Six. In 2007, an Agreement was concluded between the Irish and British Governments that removes the threat of forced expulsion of Irish prisoners from Britain, something which had caused considerable unease among Irish families settled in Britain.Finally the Flood Report measured the Irish Consular system in this area against other comparable countries and I am pleased to report that we stood up very well in comparison.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I look forward to representing the Government at the Doha International Conference on Financing for Development, which takes place from 29 November to 2 December 2008. The Conference will review the implementation of commitments made at the UN Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in 2002. Under the Monterrey Consensus, developing countries agreed to introduce sound economic and social policies, improve governance, eradicate corruption and create a domestic regulatory environment aimed at the development of the private business sector. For their part, the industrialised countries committed to increasing the levels of overseas development assistance, improving market access for developing country exports, using technology transfer to improve the impact of foreign direct investment, and relieving the heavy burden of debt on developing countries.The challenge at Doha will be to build on the international consensus on development against the background of the current international economic downturn. Ireland is playing its part in the preparation of the conference, and of the draft outcome document. Among the issues under discussion is the debt burden. Norway has proposed that, in establishing predictable debt resolution procedures, the international community needs to learn from the past by looking at the legitimacy of existing claims, based on how loans were given. We are discussing this proposal with Norway and our other colleagues at the United Nations in New York.In general, the Government supports the development of an international consensus on responsible lending and borrowing procedures and I welcome the dialogue which the World Bank has opened with civil society groups and others on the complex issues involved.Ireland has strongly supported initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries. Importantly, Ireland's bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. The Government has also provided very significant resources for the two main international instruments to address the problem, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the world's poorest and most indebted countries. Ireland's share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under MDRI is €58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006. Ireland has also contributed over €20 million to the HIPC initiative, which is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF, with the objective of reducing the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels.At Doha, Ireland will work with our partners to ensure that lessons are learned from these efforts to relieve and cancel the debt burden on developing countries, in order to free up resources for the alleviation of poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is essential that the successes to date are not undermined by further irresponsible lending or borrowing.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I believe that the fight against HIV and AIDS in Africa and beyond is fundamental to poverty reduction. We spend over €100 million annually on combating HIV and other diseases of poverty. Our assistance is targeted at those countries most affected by the pandemic including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and Malawi.The Government is investing in programmes that are benefiting those most in need, delivering anti-retroviral treatment in the countries most affected and providing support to children made vulnerable by AIDS. We also invest in empowering women and girls to protect themselves from infection.In partnership with the Clinton Foundation, Ireland has increased its funding to the Governments of Mozambique and Lesotho to improve the accessibility of HIV treatment in rural areas and in particular to women and children. As a result of our work in Mozambique, over 78,000 people are now on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002. In Lesotho, following one year of operation, 4 health facilities have been refurbished and over 2,500 people are accessing HIV treatment including 100 children.Significant progress has been made in a number of countries in reducing the prevalence of HIV and AIDS. For example, Uganda has succeeded in reducing the rates of infection from 18.3% in 1992 to 6.4% today. This is an enormous achievement. Ireland has played its part in this improvement.Ireland has contributed over €80 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) over the period 2002-2008. Almost 60% of Global Fund resources are allocated to sub-Saharan Africa and to date over 1.4 million men, women and children are accessing HIV treatment and many more are accessing essential HIV prevention and care services.We are committed to continuing our work to address HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases in Africa and to ensuring that men, women and children get access to quality health and HIV services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I remain deeply concerned at the situation in Zimbabwe. Over the last number of years, but especially in recent months, ordinary Zimbabweans have suffered from state violence, economic chaos and the collapse of basic social services such as health and education. Now, as a result of drought, the disruption caused by violence, and a lack of basic inputs such as seeds and fertilisers which farmers can no longer afford, many Zimbabweans are facing into a season of hunger. The UN believes that numbers dependent on food aid will reach 5 million people in January 2009. The European Commission has allocated an additional €10 million in relief assistance for people affected by the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, while Irish aid to the affected people for the period 2006 to 2008 (to date) amounts to approx €25m.Substantial political change is urgently needed to bring Zimbabwe back onto a path to stability, peace and economic growth. Despite the appalling violence against MDC supporters since the relatively free elections of March 2008, Morgan Tsvangirai had expressed his willingness to work with Zanu-PF in a unity government. However, the MDC can only represent the Zimbabwean people's interests effectively in government if Zanu-PF honours its commitments under the 15 September power-sharing agreement. The fact that Zanu-PF is not prepared to allow the MDC to take on the two Ministries — Finance and Interior — which are most crucial for reform is a clear demonstration of bad faith on the part of Robert Mugabe. I am frankly disappointed at the outcome of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit in Pretoria on 9 November, when regional leaders did not press Mugabe to do what it takes to make a unity government workable.The Government has engaged at EU level in the discussion of the current crisis in Zimbabwe and actively contributed to the preparation of the Conclusions adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in October. After that meeting, EU Foreign Ministers stated that the EU stands ready to support a transitional government which is taking steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. That commitment still stands. The situation in Zimbabwe was also discussed at the GAERC of 10 November.Ireland has also conveyed our concerns directly to our partner countries in Africa. We have encouraged the countries of the Southern Africa region and organizations such as SADC and the African Union to continue to press the two sides to come to a workable agreement, and to respect the democratic verdict of the Zimbabwean people. Most recently, earlier this month I instructed our Ambassadors in SADC countries once again to convey our concerns to the authorities in our partner countries in southern Africa, in advance of the 9 November SADC Summit. The Irish Ambassador to Zimbabwe, who is based in Pretoria, has had contact with Zimbabwean Ambassador there, and the Zimbabwean authorities can be in no doubt about our strong views. My Department has also had contacts with African Embassies based in Dublin on this issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The Public Service Benchmarking Body, whose report was published on 21 December 2007, carried out a detailed evaluation of the pay and jobs of 109 grades in the public service in accordance with its terms of reference.While there is not a specific link between benchmarking and services to the public, "Sustaining Progress" and its successor "Towards 2016", the ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, set out an extensive agreed programme of measures designed to achieve improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery.Examples of the above, which involve services provided to the general public by the Department of Foreign Affairs would include the following:A new on-line passport application tracking system was launched on 18 December 2006. Since then any customer, who has applied for an Irish passport, can check the current status of his or her application on-line.The Passport Office commenced the issue of the new ePassport, including the incorporation of biometrics data in passports, on 16 October 2006. This represented a major development in identity verification and security for Irish passports.Earlier this year, my Department launched an on-line registration service on the website for Irish citizens travelling or living overseas. The information submitted is used solely for the purpose of contacting the person in exceptional or emergency situations such as a natural disaster, civil unrest or a family crisis while travelling/resident abroad.The Department's Consular Section in Dublin provides support in a wide range of areas, including comprehensive advice on travel to particular countries or regions, and assistance in situations of difficulty or distress. In 2007, for example, the Department dealt with the deaths of over 130 Irish people abroad and provided assistance to our citizens in other difficult and distressing situations, including repatriation, hospitalisation, victims of crime and detention abroad.A dedicated Consular Crisis Centre was opened in January 2007 to enable the Department to respond effectively to a major crisis or emergency overseas affecting Irish citizens. The Centre can be activated within minutes during normal work times and within an hour over weekends or overnight.The Passport Express service has, over the last number of years, greatly facilitated the issuing of passports to the public and guarantees that a properly completed application will be processed in 10 working days. Some 600,000 passports were issued in 2007.Earlier this year the Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre was opened on O'Connell Street in Dublin. The Centre is a first port-of-call for those seeking information on the personal contribution they can make to overseas development, including volunteering opportunities.The foregoing are just a few examples of the range and quality of the services offered to the public by my Department. I can assure the Deputy that we will be availing of every opportunity to improve these services still further in the period ahead.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	705	The figures for Irish passports reported as lost or stolen for 2007 and from 1 January to 13 November 2008 are:YearTotal passports issuedLost or mislaidStolenTotal lost, mislaid or stolen% of total issued2007600,00032,1565,42537,5816.3%1 January to 13 November 2008539,00028,6244,45833,0826.1%These figures are in line with other comparable countries. Stolen passports represent less than 1% of the total issued.Since 2006, all passports reported lost or stolen are notified through An Garda Síochána to Interpol. This procedure is designed to reduce the risk of travel on forged documents.Applicants, who report a previous passport as lost or stolen, are advised not to travel on such a passport if it is subsequently recovered. Wording to this effect is incorporated into the passport application form. Nevertheless, a small number of individuals mistakenly use a passport previously reported as lost or stolen.In 2007, 27 Irish citizens were delayed at international border controls because they were travelling on passports which had been reported as lost or stolen. In each case, Interpol contacted the Passport Office to verify the identity of the travellers. None of these cases involved forged passports.Over the period 1 January to 13 November 2008, some 68 citizens have been delayed for the same reason. Again, n one of these cases involved forged documents.However, in 2006, shortly after Ireland commenced providing Interpol with details of lost and stolen passports, three persons were detected travelling on forged Irish passports that had previously been reported lost or stolen. One of these cases was detected by the Garda National Immigration Bureau at Dublin Airport while the other two arose in the UK.The new and more secure Irish Passport was introduced on a phased basis from December 2004. In addition to extensive traditional print security features, the laser engraved polycarbonate datapage ensures that the Irish passport is a highly fraud-resistant document. The security features are easily authenticated by the relevant authorities, including border agencies.The introduction of the biometric or e-passport on 16 October 2006 further enhanced these security features. The presence of a microchip, containing a digital image of the holder, has meant that any photo substitution can now be more readily and easily detected. These improvements mean that it has become very difficult for a forger to alter a lost or stolen passport.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	707	The person in question was born in Scotland to an Irish-born parent. He was therefore automatically an Irish citizen at birth.In the year 2000, he renounced his Irish citizenship by lodging a declaration of alienage with the Irish Embassy in Berlin and surrendered his passport.Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, a person born in the island of Ireland who has renounced Irish citizenship by making a declaration of alienage will remain entitled to be an Irish citizen. His or her Irish citizenship may be resumed by making a declaration of citizenship, in a form required by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.However, under these Acts this option is available only in cases where a person was born in the island of Ireland. Where, as in this case, a person is born outside of the island of Ireland, citizenship may be regained only through naturalisation.The person in question submitted a declaration of citizenship to the Irish Embassy in Berlin in 2004 to regain his citizenship. The Embassy advised that he could not regain citizenship through the declaration because he was not born on the island of Ireland and suggested that he explore the option of naturalisation.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has sole responsibility for legislative and policy matters regarding the granting of citizenship through naturalisation. The person in question may obtain further information regarding naturalisation from the Citizenship Division of that Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes — Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation). I have set out in the following tables the names of the consultants engaged by my Department together with an indication of the work carried out and the amounts paid to each consultant for each of the years 2000 to 2008 (to date) under both Votes.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on such expenditure. The Department commissions external advisory services only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, I am satisfied that this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.I should add that, in accordance with the Government's decision, the budgetary provision for consultancies in my Department will be reduced by 50% in 2009.(Vote 28) Consultancies — 2000CompanyService ProvidedCost€Padraig WhiteTo advise the

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I refer the Deputy to my response to question number 182 posed by Deputy O'Caoláin on Thursday 13th November 2008:In May 2008, the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) wrote to my Department requesting the inclusion of a youth delegate in Ireland's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 2009.My Department is considering the NYCI's proposal which, however, gives rise to a number of administrative and budgetary issues. Our UN Mission in New York has also been in contact with those of other Member States regarding the inclusion of youth delegates in their General Assembly delegations. In this regard, I understand that only some eighteen Member States out of a total of one hundred and ninety two have youth delegates in their delegations.A reply will issue to the NYCI as soon as consideration of all the practical and financial issues arising is completed by my Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	710	My Department is fully aware of the tragic death of the person referred to in the Deputy's question. My deepest sympathies go out to the family of the deceased.With regard to the assistance provided by the Irish Consulate General, New York to the family, I am satisfied that all possible measures were taken to assist the family at this very sad time. This included liaison with the Medical Examiner's office (the equivalent of our Coroner's office), facilitating the engagement of a funeral service to handle the removal of the remains and ongoing contact with that funeral service to ensure the timely return of the remains to Ireland.Our Consulate contacted the duty officer of an airline carrier and sought to facilitate the family's return flights to Ireland on the same day as the remains were being flown home. Unfortunately, this was not possible as the family's tickets, which were booked with another airline company, were non-transferrable without payment of the full economic rate.Our Consular Division, telephone 01 4082308, will be very happy to be contacted by the family if they wish to have any further clarification.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The calculation of the pension benefits payable to retired members of my Department, including the appropriate lump sum due, is a matter for the Department of Finance.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 for the purpose of giving support to both racing industries. Under the provisions of the Act, the Fund receives a guaranteed level of finance based on excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year, subject to a minimum level based on the year 2000 amount adjusted for inflation, subject to the limit on the total aggregate amount of the Fund. Any shortfall in the amount generated by the excise duty is made up by direct Exchequer subvention. Therefore, increases or decreases in betting tax receipts do not affect the income to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  For 2009 an amount of €69.719m has been provided for the Fund in my Department's annual estimates.In accordance with the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the Fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and Bord na gCon respectively.Since 2001, income from the Fund has been used by both bodies towards increasing prize money levels, meeting administration and integrity costs alongside a programme of capital investment, which has underpinned a growth in both sectors.In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund from €254m to €550m to continue the Fund for a further four years to 2008.A review of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is currently underway. Any increase of the Fund limit will require the approval of the Government and the Oireachtas (the level of the Fund is increased by Regulations made by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance).
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the social partners agreed that ‘benchmarking' would be an appropriate way of determining public service pay rates in the future.  The process allowed for the evaluation, by an independent body, of public service jobs and pay by reference to comparable jobs in the private sector.The report of the first benchmarking exercise was published in June 2002 and recommended varying levels of pay increases for the grades examined.  It also recommended that, apart from the first quarter of the award, the payment of the recommended pay increases should be dependent upon real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, flexibility and change.  This approach was endorsed by the social partners in Sustaining Progress.  The pay increases provided for in Towards 2016 are also predicated on co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives and on improvements in productivity.Critically, a mechanism was established for the verification of progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the public service.  In the case of the Civil Service, the Civil Service Performance Verification Group (CSPVG) was agreed by the social partners under Sustaining Progress, and the Group continues to function under Towards 2016.The Department has been co-operating fully with the CSPVG in its work of verifying or otherwise sufficient progress at organisational and grade level to warrant the award of the phased pay increases.  In this regard, the Department's Action Plan and Progress Reports to the CSPVG are publicly available on the CSPVG's website at www.cspvg.gov.ie.  In addition, since the commencement of Sustaining Progress, the actions to progress modernisation, flexibility and productivity within the Department have been incorporated into its business planning processes, including in its successive statements of strategy, annual business plans and annual reports, which are publicly available on the Department's website at www.dast.gov.ie.The most significant of the many benefits accruing from the benchmarking process in the Department include:the development of a more performance-oriented culture at both an organisational and individual level, with business planning initiatives to increase the focus on performance and accountability;the preparation of Annual Output Statements which are submitted to the Oireachtas along with the annual estimate aimed at clearly linking resources with outputs and outcomes;the development of a more customer-focused ethos involving the setting of demanding quality customer service commitments in the Department's successive customer charters and customer service action plans; the achievement of increased efficiencies and effectiveness in the Department's core business functions, in particular, in the administration of grant schemes in the areas of arts, culture and sport.the introduction of a performance management and development system which integrates the system of performance assessment of individuals with the award of increments and eligibility to apply for promotion;the greatly increased proportion of promotions (almost 100%) made on an exclusively competitive basis;the more direct responsibility and accountability for the management of staff by the Secretary General underpinned by legislative changes and, in turn, by line managers in the Department; andthe realisation of economies of scale by shared approaches to common infrastructures, systems and services between the Department and other public sector organisations in the areas of finance, information systems and procurement.In this regard, I would reference the response of the CSPVG to the Department's fourth progress report under Towards 2016, in which the Group states that ‘the implementation of the modernisation agenda to date has resulted in real improvements in public services as well as in the management of civil service organisations both in terms of improved efficiency and effectiveness'.  The Group goes on to note in particular ‘the progress in the area of competitive merit-based promotion and the continued emphasis by organisations on the importance of the improvement of customer service generally'.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	714	Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.A grant of €140,000 was provisionally allocated to the project in question under the 2006 Sports Capital Programme. The grant allocation was subject to the terms and conditions of the Programme, which included the execution of a deed of covenant and charge.A deed of covenant and charge provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The Department's legal adviser, the Chief State Solicitor's Office — CSSO — deals with the grantee's solicitor in executing this deed. I understand that the CSSO recently received documentation regarding the case from the solicitors representing the organisation. The documentation submitted has been examined by the CSSO, who last week wrote to the grantee's solicitor requesting further documentation to execute the deed.The position yesterday (17 November) remained that while the CSSO has received a further response from the solicitors representing the organisation, it still awaits the submission of further outstanding legal documentation.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	715	The average sick absences in the Department, including the National Archives, over the last two years are as follows:2006:  6.75 days;2007: 9.88 days.The calculations include a small number of long-term sick absences that serve to inflate the figures somewhat.The data in respect of the previous three years is not readily available due to major restructuring of the Department in May 2005 which resulted in the establishment of the National Library and the National Museum as separate statutory organisations which retain the details of its staff members.In revising the figures to take account of long-term sick leave, absences beyond four weeks have been counted as a long-term absence.The average sick absences in the Department, including the National Archives, over the last two years, excluding long term illness cases,  are as follows:2006, 4.32 days; and2007, 4.78 days.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 to 377, inclusive, together.Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Since 1998, over €725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.Some 1,453 applications were received in 2008 seeking €296m.  The Department assesses all applications received.  For local projects, the level of funding to each county, including Wexford, is on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of the available funding on the basis of the population as set out in the 2006 census of population conducted by the Central Statistics Office, subject to the number, nature and quality of applications received for each county. The level of allocations therefore to successful local applicants in each county in 2007 and 2008 was primarily determined by the overall level of allocations available under the programme in those years for local clubs and the population of the county.All applications from an individual county are assessed by one member of staff to ensure a consistent approach to applications from the county concerned.  These assessments are then subject to quality proofing by more senior officers to the officer which conducted the initial assessment.  Applications which meet the basic qualifying conditions each receive a score, which decides their order of priority within their own county.  This system applies in each county.The following table sets out, by reference to the relevant parliamentary question number, the scores of individual clubs sought by the Deputy:Question NumberScore41077/086741078/087041079/088041080/087141081/086341082/0881

No decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the Programme. Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.Since 1998 the Programme has allocated over €725 million to over 7,400 projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breadth of the country.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.

The Government recognises the opportunity in appropriate cases where school premises could be made available to the wider community.I should also mention that improved use of school facilities at evenings and weekends was a recommendation of the taskforce on active citizenship.  The recommendations of the Taskforce have been accepted by Government and are now being advanced.  To promote and support this approach, the Gaeltacht Improvement Scheme operated by my Department can provide assistance towards the development of certain school facilities for use by community groups in the Gaeltacht and on the islands.  In providing such assistance, as well as enhancing school facilities, it would be the aim of my Department to develop the culture, heritage and the social infrastructure of the Gaeltacht and the islands and to support the Irish language.In addition, the Steering Group overseeing the development of the new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016 are considering the development of facilities for the general youth population and those most "at-risk" through increased access to community, sports and school facilities.  My Department has been actively pursuing the promotion and support of the use of school facilities by community groups through the National Assessment Committee of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.  In addition, funding from Dormant Accounts has been made available to support a number of sports halls and facilities in schools.

Poor infrastructure is one of the major challenges faced in such areas.  For this reason, the CLÁR Programme has focused on those elements of infrastructure, social and economic, that most affect the lives of local communities.  One of the strengths of the CLÁR Programme has always been its ability to focus on priority needs in CLÁR areas.As Minister, I believe that we need to be constantly addressing the new challenges faced by small rural communities and that the programme must be continuously refocused to deal with the most urgent infrastructural deficits especially in the current economic climate.  My Department will continue to review the entire programme and the individual measures within it to ensure its continued relevance.  My Department officials are in discussions with various Government Departments, State Agencies and other interested parties in relation to new and existing measures on an ongoing basis.  The development of CLÁR will be kept under review in this context.

The Programme is managed on behalf of the Department by Pobal.The Government has given a commitment to continue to prioritise investment in the existing RAPID areas and no area currently included in the Programme will lose its eligibility for priority treatment.  My attention at present is focused on an analysis of recent Census data with a view to ensuring that the boundaries of existing RAPID areas are appropriate.  A key concern will be to ensure that the effectiveness of the RAPID Programme is not diluted and that Government action continues to prioritise and target communities with the greatest needs.I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.These schemes are subject to ongoing review to ensure that they remain responsive to the demands of the RAPID communities.  Where opportunities arise, the eligibility of individual schemes can be extended to reflect emerging needs identified by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.The 2006 evaluation of the RAPID Programme indicated that the experience of the Programme has been very positive in many areas and that it has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.  The evaluation recommended that a future Programme should be developed under a number of key Strategic Themes.  These were Community Safety & Anti-social Behaviour, Family, Youth, Physical Environment, Education, Health and Employment/Training.A national framework for the development of these strategic themes is now in place. Each Department/Agency with responsibility for the strategic themes has prepared guidance for the Area Implementation Team that includes objectives, performance indicators and targets.  These will be further developed within the AIT in each RAPID area.  I launched the Health, Family and Community Safety and Anti-social Behaviour themes on 30th January 2008.  In September 2008 I launched the RAPID Education Theme and the Physical Environment Theme. Responsibility for the development of each strategic theme rests with the lead Department or Agency.  I expect to launch the remaining Themes shortly.

Under the Dormant Accounts Acts, disbursement of unclaimed dormant accounts are used for the purposes of assisting three broad categories of persons — those affected by economic and social disadvantage, those affected by educational disadvantage and persons with a disability.The amount of funding transferred from financial institutions to the Dormant Accounts Fund since 2003 is as follows:YearAmount€2003196,209,141200456,024,667200540,815,461200680,149,281200766,293,7952008 to end October31,738,970Total471,231,315Of the funds transferred, some 163 million has been reclaimed by the account holders at the end of October 2008.In relation to the funding available to my own Department, and subject to a Supplementary Estimate for my Department, the level of expenditure in 2008 on projects supported by the Dormant Accounts Fund will amount to 12m.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The supplementary welfare allowance  (SWA) scheme, which  is  administered  on  behalf of the department by the Community Welfare Division of the  Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of rent supplement to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs.Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than €13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.The Executive has advised rent supplement has not been withdrawn from the persons concerned.  They are in receipt of their full entitlement to rent supplement based on their income from jobseekers benefit and disability benefit having regard to the fact that they are required to contribute additional assessable means of €56.50 which they have over and above the basic SWA rate appropriate to their circumstances. The Executive has further advised that there is no record of an appeal from the persons concerned. It is open to the persons concerned to appeal against the decision of the community welfare officer to the Executive's designated Appeals Office.

The Funding Standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding.The overall operation of the Funding Standard is discussed in the Green Paper on pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the framework for pensions which the Government has indicated it will announce by the end of the year.However, in considering any amendments to the funding standard a balance must be struck between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need to, as far as we can, ensure the short-term security of the benefits already accrued by employees in a scheme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	733	The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, which is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. Under the legislation governing the scheme, the HSE may make a single payment to meet an exceptional need to people on social welfare or health board payments.   This is a once-off payment to meet an unforeseen or special need that cannot be met from a person's basic income.Assistance in the form of an Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) can be also made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA, to assist, for example in cases of flood damage with immediate needs, such as food, clothing, fuel, household goods and shelter. Assistance can be provided to people affected in cash or in kind.There is no automatic entitlement to these payments.  Each application is determined on the particular circumstances of the case. In assessing income, consideration is given as to whether a person is in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment or to the gross household income with allowance made as appropriate under normal SWA means assessments.Over the past few months, flooding has been experienced in a number of areas of the country. The Department's role in response to the recent flooding primarily involves supporting the community welfare service in the provision of ENP and UNP funding in the short term and other supports where applicable to cater for the long term effects of the flooding.  Any support given relates to damage to a person's home or loss of essential items.  It does not extend to business or commercial losses.  Some 24 payments were made in response to the flooding incident to which the Deputy refers. In addition, 5 households have been paid rent supplement.Local community welfare officers are available to provide assistance on an individual basis where that is warranted.  If any person is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding, they should contact their local community welfare officer in the first instance.

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The Executive has advised that the persons concerned were awarded an exceptional needs payment of €1,727.50 on 10 November 2008.  If they are unhappy with the amount of the exceptional needs payment it is open to them to appeal against the decision of the community welfare officer to the Executive's designated Appeals Office.  If there has been any change in the circumstances of the persons concerned, they should contact their local Community Welfare Officer.

To qualify for this payment, a person must satisfy the conditions as to means and in this case the claim was disallowed by a Deciding Officer on the grounds that his means exceeded the weekly rate payable. He was assessed with weekly means of €1,492 derived from self-employment.He appealed this decision and following a review his means were adjusted downwards and he was given a Nil means assessment.  Generally in the case of self-employed persons their income in the past twelve months is taken as a reflection of their likely income over the next twelve months. However, each case is treated on its merits and in relation to the person concerned it was accepted, during the review, that his income for the past twelve months is not an accurate reflection of his likely income over the next twelve months and the decision was revised accordingly. He now qualifies for full payment of jobseekers allowance from the date of his claim.

On foot of a High Court judgement, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights. The reason for the declaration was the failure of the State to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law.  As such, the High Court judgement is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act. The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on. In that context, it is essential to obtain the confirmation of the Supreme Court that the judgement was warranted and to seek clarity on all its implications.As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment further at this time.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2007 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks. Processing times for 2008 are not yet available but are expected to be at least of the same order having regard to a 25% increase in appeals received so far this year.The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required. Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings. In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative.I am advised that the social welfare appeals system is a quasi- judicial one and that the procedures in place for determining appeals are designed to ensure that each case receives full and satisfactory consideration. While improving processing times remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.

This disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.The person concerned made application for disability allowance on 13 November 2007. She was refused disability allowance on the grounds that she was deemed by a Medical Assessor to be not medically suitable for disability allowance. She subsequently appealed this decision. At a second medical examination, a Medical Assessor found her also to be not medically suitable for disability allowance. Following an oral hearing by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, her appeal was allowed and she was deemed to be medically suitable for disability allowance.Her file has been re-referred to the Social Welfare Inspector for an up to date means assessment. A final decision will be given on this person's application for Disability Allowance upon receipt of the Social Welfare Inspector's report. She will be notified directly of the outcome.

VDWs can qualify for credited contributions in respect of a period spent working in a developing country and any preparatory period before hand.  These credited contributions enable the workers to qualify for short-term benefits on their return from their overseas development work and support their accrued entitlement towards long-term benefits.In order to qualify for the credited contributions, a volunteer development worker must satisfy the following criteria:be over 16 years of age,be resident in the State immediately prior to taking up the employment overseas, andbe employed under conditions of remuneration similar to those applied in the developing country.Although the individual in question has worked overseas for a period of eight years the maximum number of years for which any individual can claim VDW credits is five.  The maximum amount of 260 VDW credits has been added to the individual's contribution record.  There are no plans to extend the scheme beyond the current five year duration.

Funding from the Family Support Agency helps with staffing and equipping these centres. By the end of 2007, the number of Family Resource Centres had expanded from an original 10 to 106 nationwide. The funding for the Programme increased from €317,000 in 1994 to nearly €19 million in 2007.In the context of the National Development Plan, it was intended to expand the number of Family Resource Centres by up to 6 centres this year and to provide some existing ones with additional staff. The organisation referred to by the Deputy is one of the projects that have applied for inclusion in the Family Resource Centre Programme and that meet the criteria. However, as part of the Government's collective approach to controlling short-term expenditure in the interests of Ireland's future prosperity, with the exception of a new centre in Killeshandra that was approved earlier this year, no new Family Resource Centres will open in 2008. It will also not be possible to increase the staffing complement of the existing centres.Government support for family services will however remain strong. Last year, additional staff were funded for 40 Family Resource Centres. It should also be noted that in June I approved counselling grants of almost €11 million to 600 voluntary and community groups supporting families nationwide.

In this context, under successive public service pay agreements, most recently under Towards 2016 , there is a requirement on public bodies to develop modernisation action plans and to report in advance of all phases of the pay agreement increases, on the progress made on these plans. In line with this obligation, the Department of Social and Family Affairs developed, and is implementing, a detailed modernisation action plan. The objective of the plan is to reflect the ongoing nature of the work of modernisation within the Department in order to meet its present needs and future requirements, particularly with regard to the services provided to the public.The modernisation action plan builds on the programme of change and modernisation which the Department undertook under the previous agreement Sustaining Progress. It contains over 60 actions and was agreed with staff and union representatives through the Department's partnership structures. Under its change programme, the Department has implemented a wide range of modernisation initiatives including the development of major new computer systems, the achievement of substantial productivity gains through work process re-engineering and the provision of new customer focused service delivery initiatives.Payment of the public service pay increase provisions of Towards 2016 is dependent on the verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with the implementation of the initiatives under the modernisation action plan. In assessing progress in this regard, the Public Service Performance Verification Group (CSPVG) has particular regard to the progress made in front-line service delivery. The Department has submitted four progress reports under Towards 2016 and on each occasion has satisfied the CSPVG on the progress made in achieving its modernisation objectives particularly with respect to service delivery.In addition, the Department has an ongoing programme of customer consultation and has undertaken a number of customer surveys in recent years in order to obtain feedback on the level of services provided. In general, customers have indicated that they are satisfied with the service they receive from the Department.  The Department has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to developing and enhancing its services to the public over many years and I am satisfied it will continue to do so in order to meet the needs of its increasing customer base.

Her reply, along with the further medical evidence was sent to the Chief Medical Advisor on 9 September 2008, who expressed the opinion that this evidence did not affect the previous findings by the Medical Assessors.The case has now been referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing.

The main services provided from these offices include jobseekers payment, one-parent family payment and an information service.  Branch Offices are operated under a contract for service and decisions on claims taken in Branch Offices are made in its departmental parent Local Office.There has been a significant increase in the number of people claiming since the beginning of the year.  The level of inflows to the Live Register over the period January to October 2008 inclusive was 361,940 as compared with 243,413 over the corresponding period last year representing an increase of over 49%.In the past few years the Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the numbers of persons accessing services.  Operational procedures and the organisation of work continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the benefits of technology and new developments in processing techniques and business information.The Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions vary between the two jobseeker schemes and involve, among other things, the need to establish the person's social insurance record, establish the person's identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of his/her application.The overall performance in any individual office in processing claims can be adversely affected by a wide variety of factors; including increased inflow of claims, staff vacancies and the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office. The number of claims awaiting a decision is given in Table 1.Because of the increased number of claims for jobseeker payments the Department undertook a review of staffing levels in Local Offices in May and June of this year.  This resulted in the assignment of an additional 31 staff to some 15 Local Offices.  Following on the most recent review of the staffing levels in Local Offices, an additional 115 staff are to be assigned to some 48 offices.For claims processed in October 2008 the average processing time was 3 weeks for Jobseekers Benefit and 5 weeks for Jobseekers Allowance.

This is due to the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years and the take up of the Rural Social Scheme which is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and which also specifically targets low-income farmers.The Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.  Information on farm assist is provided through the normal channels including information leaflets and guides and through the Department network of local and branch offices. Each Local Office has officers who are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services to people.  This locally based service is supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.Staff also attend exhibitions and seminars throughout the country promoting information on social welfare rights and entitlements.  A stand was provided at the Ploughing Championships in Cuffesgrange, Co. Kilkenny in September giving information on all schemes and services including Farm Assist.In addition, information on all our schemes and services is available on the Department's website, www.welfare.ie.The Citizens Information Board, which comes under the aegis of the Department, also provides information through approximately 260 Citizen Information Centres and other outlets around the country, through a phone service which operates from 9am to 9pm Monday to Friday, and the website www.citizensinformation.ie.Farm assist has brought about significant worthwhile improvements for low income farmers, particularly for those with children, making a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.

In this regard measures set out in the Policy reflect best practice across all sectors both nationally and internationally and these are kept under review for the purposes of evaluating and, where necessary, increasing their effectiveness.The measures include return to work interviews, a comprehensive Health Promotion Policy and supports for staff who are returning to work after a long term illness.My Department also works closely with the Chief Medical Officer who plays a crucial role in advising the department on employee's fitness for work from a medical perspective.

Of this number 20,090 have less than 260 contributions recorded up to the end of the 2007 tax year, the latest year for which the department has contribution details.  75,835 were in receipt of benefit for less than 6 months and of this number 47,996 appear to have less than 260 contributions.I should point out to the Deputy that some of these people will have stopped claiming jobseekers benefit before their entitlement ceases and others will have commenced claiming.  Some of these will also be affected by the changes announced in Budget 2009 in relation to the length of time for which jobseeker's benefit will be paid.It is envisaged that in 2009 a weekly average of 2,400 people will be affected by the reduction in duration from 312 days to 234 days and 3,860 people in a full year.  A weekly average of 6,750 people will be affected by the reduction in duration from 390 days to 312 days and 9,200 people in a full year.All jobseeker's benefit claimants are notified 3 months in advance of exhausting their benefit.  This is to allow sufficient time to undertake a means test where a person wishes to apply for jobseekers allowance. This arrangement will apply to those claimants affected by the changes announced in the budget.  The earliest date on which the new conditions as to duration can have an effect is mid April 2009.  Consequently, the department will begin contacting persons affected in January.Some claimants who have less than 260 PRSI contributions recorded may have additional contributions paid in 2008 which would not yet be recorded in the department.  These contributions could bring their total to 260 or more and this would extend their entitlement from 234 days (9 months) to 312 days (12 months).  Similarly, others could have insurance in another EU member state which could also bring their total contributions to 260 or more.

A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.The Executive has advised that a mortgage interest supplement of €660.30 per month has been awarded to the person concerned from the 24 November 2008. The Executive has further advised that the mortgage interest supplement is, as an exceptional measure, being paid at a rate which is higher than that which the person concerned would normally be entitled to receive, because of the particular circumstances that apply in this case at present.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than €13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.The first €75 of additional income, that is, income above the standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to a person's circumstances, is disregarded for mortgage interest supplement purposes, with any additional income above €75 assessed at 75%. This measure ensures that people have a financial incentive to take up education or training opportunities or return to employment.The Executive has advised that the person concerned had been awarded a mortgage interest supplement of €466.20 per month from 1 August 2008. She has since been awarded family income supplement of €150 per week from 1 October 2008. When this additional income is taken into account the revised rate of mortgage interest supplement payable is €194.07 per month from 1 October 2008.

If there is any new evidence or new facts pertinent to these cases that were not brought to the attention of the Appeals Officer during the determination of their appeals, they may be submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for further consideration.Additionally, the Chief Appeals Officer has power under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 to revise any decision where it appears to him that the Appeals Officer's decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts. In making a request for such a review an appellant must set down the reasons why he or she believes a mistake was made having regard to the application of the law or the facts.The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 also provides that any person who is dissatisfied with either the decision of the Appeals Officer or the outcome of the review carried out by the Chief Appeals Officer may appeal that decision and/or outcome, as the case may be, to the High Court on any question of law.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

In addition, the organization of ex servicemen and women (ONET) is officially recognized by the Department and is dedicated to looking after the welfare of all former personnel of the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	761	The individual concerned was retired, by the President, on the advice of the Government with effect from a date in June, 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to Section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and Paragraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired "in the interests of the service". The Deputy will appreciate that a decision to retire an officer "in the interests of the service" is only taken for the most compelling reasons. The Government advice to the President in 1969 was on grounds of security. I am satisfied that the matter was handled in an entirely appropriate and proper manner in 1969 and that the decision taken then was taken only after very detailed and due consideration.The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 in relation to the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999 on grounds of inordinate delay in the bringing of the proceedings. The individual appealed to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court refused the appeal in January 2001.In early July 2002, arising from a newspaper feature article on the case, published on 29th June 2002, the then Minister requested the Judge Advocate General to examine and to review the case.The Judge Advocate General, a civilian barrister, carried out a detailed examination and review of all the historical documentation relating to the decision to retire the individual concerned, by reference to the entirety of both the Department of Defence and the military files in the matter. Her report was submitted to the then Minister in mid September, 2002 and was published in October, 2002.In December 2002 the individual applied to the High Court for an order quashing this report by the Judge Advocate General. The High Court found in favour of the applicant for reasons enumerated in the text of the High Court judgement on his application. The High Court judgement of 27th July 2005 related only to the report completed by the civilian Judge Advocate General in September 2002. The presiding judge, Mr. Justice Quirke, held that that report should be quashed because fair procedures had not been applied in the compilation and production of that report and in the timing of the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the applicant. Mr. Justice Quirke concluded his judgement by stating that "The decision made in 1969 to recommend the Applicant's retirement from the Defence Forces remains unaffected by any Order made in these proceedings."It should be emphasized therefore that the High Court judgement in the matter of the report of the Judge Advocate General specifically related to the actual procedures utilized by the Judge Advocate General in the course of her review and examination of this matter in 2002 and to the release by the Department of Defence of certain documents to the individual only after completion of the report. The individual concerned specifically did not seek an Order for mandamus from the High Court and therefore did not request the High Court to remit the matter or to direct a resumption of the Judge Advocate General's original enquiry, or to direct that a new enquiry be held by the Judge Advocate General or by any other person.The substantive issue, namely the Government decision in 1969 to recommend the retirement of this individual from the Defence Forces by the President, remains unaffected by the judgement of the High Court, a point specifically emphasised within the text of the judgement itself.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to take any further action in relation to this matter.

Provisional data from Returning Officers indicate that a total of some €139,000 was expended on storage in the first six months of 2008.In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines (some 4,762 in total) were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in relation to the electronic voting project. In this, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.  No valuation exercise has been undertaken along the lines referred to in the questions.Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  It is not possible to make more specific comment at this point on the project itself, or on future storage costs, pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.

The Environmental Protection Agency is the national authority with overall responsibility for implementing the Environmental Noise Regulations.The Regulations require the preparation of strategic noise maps by relevant local authorities, Dublin Airport Authority, the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency, to assess the numbers of population exposed to various noise levels associated with infrastructure, including major roads, railways, airports and industrial sites.  There is also a mapping requirement for large agglomerations which, in the Irish context, comprises the cities of Dublin and Cork.The regulations require local authorities to produce action plans designed for the purpose of managing noise issues and their effects, including noise reduction, if necessary.

It is included in all fire officership training provided by the Fire Services Council and at training courses abroad, and is included in fire officer handbooks.As part of the Safety and Health Enhancement module of the Fire Services Change Programme, an updated National Incident Command System was developed and training was provided across the country.Regrettably, I understand that SIPTU has instructed its members not to cooperate with the introduction of the National Incident Command System and that the matter is due to be heard by the Labour Court early in December 2008.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	772	The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  The Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through the setting of general policy and the provision of capital funding.I assume that the question refers to risk assessment in the context of safety, health and welfare legislation.  Risk assessment is used in multiple contexts including major emergency management by fire services.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 sets out statutory requirements for risk assessment.  As part of the Safety and Health Enhancement module of the Fire Services Change Programme 2005-2007, a new Ancillary Safety Statement Template was developed, in conjunction with the Health and Safety Authority and stakeholders, which included a risk assessment methodology for fixed work locations such as fire stations.  Furthermore, as fire authorities respond to incidents anywhere in their functional area, a dynamic risk assessment process is an integral part of the National Incident Command System.

This is done primarily by designating appropriate sites as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) or Special Protection Areas (SPA) and by protecting the ecological interests of those sites.  Designation of a site may have implications for landowners, as management and use of these lands must have regard to the protection of the habitats and species for which the site is designated.My Department directly notifies all readily identifiable landowners within the boundaries of sites that are proposed for designation.  Individual landowners are notified in writing and are sent information packs on the relevant site which include a map indicating the proposed boundaries and details on the implications of the designation and the process of objecting to the proposed designation. Landowners are given a 3-month period during which they can lodge an objection to a proposal to designate a site for nature conservation.The names and addresses of affected landowners are sourced from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Property Registration Authority and through the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. A commercially available database is also used to identify landowners in urban and peri-urban locations.  Additional measures are taken where there is a possibility that an individual might be missed. In such cases, my Department ensures that proposed designations of SACs and SPAs are advertised in local newspapers and on local radio. Relevant maps are also displayed for public viewing in the local offices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the local offices of the Department of Social, and Family Affairs, local Teagasc offices, local Garda stations and public libraries.All planning authorities within whose functional area a site, or any part of a proposed site, is situated are notified with comprehensive data and information when any SAC or SPA designation is proposed.

In July 2008 the RPII published the results of a three-year long baseline study on the exposure of the Irish population to ionising radiation, which includes radon. This report, entitled "Radiation Doses Received by the Irish Population", is the most comprehensive assessment of radiation exposure ever undertaken in this country.The Report found that, as is the case in the majority of other countries, radon is the principal source of radiation exposure in Ireland, representing over 56% of the dose received by the Irish population. In terms of reducing our exposure to radiation, radon is the area where the greatest impact is possible.Since 1998 the Building Regulations require all new buildings to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004 an updated edition of Technical Guidance Document C on Part C of the Building Regulations (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) was published incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that radon protection measures are carried out more effectively. These radon prevention measures were in advance of building code requirements in many EU Member States.As regards houses built before 1998, the Government's approach, which is similar to that of the majority of EU member states, is to concentrate on awareness-raising. Householders, particularly those in known High Radon Areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary. The RPII, in partnership with Local Authorities and the Health Service Executive (HSE), has carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and in some instances where areas of particularly high radon levels have been found they have written directly to householders in these areas. This will continue to be the focus so as to enable and encourage householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.If a household is found to have high radon levels remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department called "Radon in Buildings — Corrective Option". The RPII has also issued guidance entitled "Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide". In addition, the website of the RPII provides a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.The Scheme of Housing Aid for Older People is available to assist older people, generally over 60 years, to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes. Where a suite of works is being grant aided under this scheme, local authorities may also, as part of the package of works, assist with the provision of radon remediation works, where applicable.A working group involving my Department, local authorities and the RPII has recently been set up to provide clear guidance for local authorities on addressing high radon concentrations in social housing. My Department has already given approval to a number of local authorities to undertake, on a sample basis, radon surveys of their housing stock in high incidence areas. In addition the RPII have directly contacted local authorities with known areas of high radon concentration to encourage them to test local authority housing stock for radon, and where necessary, take remedial action. A number of local authorities are already taking action in this regard and it is intended to build on their, and the RPII's, experience in this area. Members of the public can access information on radon on the RPII website, www.rpii.ie. Publications and information leaflets about radon can be downloaded free of charge. The RPII can also be contacted on Freephone 1800 300 600.On Thursday, 6 November, 2008 I opened Ireland's Sixth National Radon Forum in the Royal College of Physicians, Dublin. The theme of the Forum was "how agencies can work together to assess, communicate and fix radon problems". The aim of the Forum, in addition to raising public awareness, was to provide the opportunity for those with an interest in radon to meet and discuss issues of mutual interest. These included radon measurement companies, remediation companies, researchers, legislators, representatives of national agencies with responsibility for building standards, health and safety experts as well as members of the public and the national media.My Department will continue to work closely with the RPII, the HSE, local authorities and other interested agencies to raise public awareness as well as promote radon testing and remediation works. This multi-agency approach to dealing with radon is in line with international best practice, as recommended by the World Health Organisation's International Radon Project, which is co-funded by the Irish Government.

In accordance with best practice, approved bodies should provide a sinking fund to deal with operational and maintenance issues, including the undertaking of minor adaptations and refurbishment to meet the needs of tenants.Approved housing bodies may also apply to the local authority for grant assistance under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability scheme in respect of necessary adaptations to a dwelling.

In May 2008, my Department notified Galway County and City Councils of combined capital allocations of €1,820,130 and €1,049,490 respectively for the operation of these Schemes.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the Schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them, and to manage the operation of the Schemes in their area from within this allocation.On foot of heightened levels of activity experienced locally following the implementation of the revised suite of grant schemes, both Galway County and City Councils each received a supplementary allocation of €300,000 in September 2008.Notification of individual allocations to local authorities for the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability in 2009 will be made following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009.  My Department is in the process of liaising with all local authorities regarding their funding requirements under the schemes in 2009.The Government decided in February 2006, to transfer the administration of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the HSE to my Department.  The Scheme has been funded through a taskforce under the aegis of my Department.  Pending the final transfer, the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme was discontinued from 1 August 2008, with applications on hand at that date to be processed by the HSE.  My Department provided an initial allocation of €13 million to the HSE earlier this year for the operation of the scheme and I expect to make an additional allocation shortly in respect of the payment of claims on hand.  A further allocation, to complete this process, is expected to follow in 2009.I am conscious of the need to ensure a smooth and seamless transfer of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the HSE to the local authority sector and my Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.  Pending full resolution of outstanding issues my Department and the HSE have agreed interim arrangements for action and co-operation at local level as regards the administration of the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.  These arrangements will ensure the best possible outcomes for all applicants under the scheme.

The Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006 also provides that conditions regarding community facilities can be attached to consent for strategic infrastructure under the Act.In accordance with the Programme for Government, a new Commission on Taxation was established on 14 February 2008. Among its tasks, the Commission is to consider and make recommendations on options for the future financing of local government.  In this context, the Green Paper suggested that consideration could be given to extending the aforementioned betterment concepts as a funding option for local government.The matter is currently under consideration by the Commission on Taxation, which is due to report by the end of September 2009.

However, the type of domestic measures required to meet the target without credits cannot be implemented in the short term and credits are needed.I believe that the challenge we face in terms of the extent of national greenhouse gas emission reductions required for Kyoto Protocol compliance purposes and beyond demands an all-party approach on targets and objectives.  I hope that agreement on this can be achieved through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	782	The aim of the benchmarking exercises carried out by the Public Service Benchmarking Body, first established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has been to carry out detailed examination in relation to the jobs, pay and conditions of public servants and compare these with jobs of equal size in the private sector using representative comparative data on pay and conditions.  In undertaking this work, the aim has been to move away from the traditional approach to determining pay based on relativities.The two benchmarking exercises conducted to date have been undertaken with regard to a broad range of considerations, including public service modernisation.  Co-operation with modernisation and change, and an increased focused on performance and accountability, are continuing requirements of a modern public service.In terms of public service modernisation in general, and provisions set out under successive social partnership agreements in particular, my Department has been engaged in an extensive programme of modernisation and change in recent years.The Department plays a pivotal role in framing policies and overseeing implementation of a wide range of programmes that impact on people's lives.  Major programmes are delivered for the most part through the local government sector, but the Department plays a critical role in delivering on key measures.  In particular, our leadership of the climate change agenda; our performance in tackling environmental management and protection issues in relation to waste and water; our outcomes in supporting quality housing in sustainable communities and in promoting balanced regional development that safeguards natural and historical assets, have a profound impact on quality of life throughout the country. Given the breadth of my Department's mandate, and the need to address environmental, economic and social issues that are both complex and changing, it is critical that it continues to develop as a responsive and agile organisation.  In this context, achievements under the modernisation and change agenda, in recent years, have included:extensive policy development, particularly in relation to climate change, waste management, housing;major capital investment and programmes in areas such as water, waste recycling and housing infrastructure;modernisation of the regulatory framework in, for example, planning, local government and environmental protection;the development of enhanced financial management procedures, and use of ICT systems, to improve both internal administrative processes and to provide enhanced services to our customers;improvements in forecast accuracy and automation of service delivery in Met Éireann;an increased focus on  performance and accountability both at the organisational and individual levels, in particular through the introduction of Annual Output Statements, value for money assessment frameworks, and the linkage of the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) with HR processes.Under the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the modernisation agenda, and maintenance of stable industrial relations, is undertaken by the Civil Service Performance Verification Group (CSPVG).  Full details regarding progress made by my Department over the course of Towards 2016 in relation to modernisation and change, and the resultant improvements in delivery, can be found on the CSPVG's website — www.cspvg.gov.ie.

Sheep stocking in these areas is currently too high to be compatible with the preservation of these habitats and agreement has been reached with farmers and their representative groups to return stocking rates.In order to achieve this, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have implemented new grazing arrangements in these SACs. To determine the required level of destocking at commonage and farm level, it was necessary to count the number of sheep on the SACs.  To this end, farmers brought their sheep down from the mountains and any sheep remaining on the hills were monitored by staff of the two Departments during two overflights by helicopter, which was deemed the most cost effective and practical means of counting sheep over a large geographical area.The cost of hiring both helicopters was just under €14,450 including VAT.  No other costs additional to normal staff time were incurred. Farmers in the areas concerned and their representatives were fully consulted and were notified in advance of the exercise.

The person who offers the building for sale or letting, or any agent acting on their behalf, is required to produce a printed copy of the Building Energy Rating certificate to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting in the building.  A person who contravenes these requirements commits an offence and is liable, on prosecution by the Building Control Authority in whose functional area the building is situated, to be fined a sum not exceeding €5,000.  It is reasonable to expect however that the law agents working for the parties to a contract for sale or letting will ensure that all mandatory requirements attaching to the sale or letting of the property will be fulfilled in a manner sufficient to obviate the need for prosecution.

However, the year to year costs of incremental pay increases are normally offset by corresponding reductions in costs associated with retirements and other movements by staff on higher points on the incremental scales and their replacement by staff on lower points. It is not possible therefore to estimate the savings that would be achieved by suspending incremental pay increases in 2009.Day to day operational matters, including an estimate of the savings that would be made by suspending incremental pay increases in 2009 in the agencies reporting to my Department are matters for the individual agencies concerned.

Final decisions on projects to be supported under the Fund are not, therefore, envisaged for the present.

Accordingly, agreement of a financial contribution to satisfy the Part V condition is in lieu of a percentage of land and not in lieu of housing.Where the Part V agreement is to be satisfied by means other than the provision of land on-site, the planning authority must consider a range of factors, including whether it will contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of the housing strategy, and whether it constitutes the best use of the resources available to the authority to ensure an adequate supply of housing.  Therefore, the legal obligation under Part V can be satisfied by way of a financial contribution only if the local authority considers it appropriate.While the Government's clearly stated preference is for Part V to be satisfied through the delivery of completed homes, circumstances can arise in which a financial contribution may be appropriate.  For example, in cases where Part V would yield only a small number of very expensive social and affordable homes, a financial contribution may provide an opportunity to support the delivery of a greater number of homes elsewhere.  All monies received by local authorities under Part V must be ring-fenced for reinvestment in the provision of social and affordable housing.Given that the vast bulk of the significantly increased delivery under Part V is in the form of completed homes or land, I am satisfied that the process is operating effectively.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 to 473, inclusive, together.The Programme for Government signalled the development of waste and resource policy in the direction of sustainability and, in particular, to move away from mass burn incineration towards alternative technologies.  Arising from a commitment in the Programme, a major international review of waste management strategy is now underway.  This will inform the Government's approach to waste prevention and minimisation and to diversion of waste from landfill.  This review will examine, in particular, the emergence of new technologies in waste management, particularly those for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, which can reduce the need for incineration or landfill.The Government is acutely conscious of the very real and imminent challenge posed for Ireland by the EU Landfill Directive.  To meet our obligations under this Directive will require a doubling of the amount of biodegradable waste diverted away from landfill by 2010.  It is necessary to accelerate the move away from landfill quite dramatically, to examine all the technologies that can contribute to this and to regulate the sector in a manner which supports optimal environmental performance at minimum cost.  The review is not just about technology.  Its terms of reference are deliberately broad so as to promote a fundamental review of the legal, institutional and financial approach to waste management.Inaction is not an option and the approach reflected in the current waste management plans, while facilitating some progress, is not going far enough fast enough. Ireland needs to pursue the most innovative solutions available and applied internationally, so as to move from being an under achiever to world class standard and to a position of leadership rather than struggling to meet EU targets, as at present.Undue emphasis on incineration as the cornerstone of waste management policy is detrimental to the development of alternative solutions.  The review may well indicate some residual role for thermal treatment in our future waste management strategy but I do not envisage it being on anything like the scale that was previously planned.The National Waste Report, produced annually by the EPA, indicates 36.1% of municipal waste was recycled in 2006.  It anticipated that this may rise to 40% in 2010 and 50% in 2016.Further data available to my Department from the National Waste Report were used to extrapolate that by 2016, and having met EU landfill diversion targets, the volume of waste requiring further treatment could potentially be reduced to some 400,000 tonnes provided that sufficient capacity for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste can be developed in that timeframe.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I assume that the question refers to planning applications submitted to An Bord Pleanála in respect of development specified in the Seventh Schedule of the Planning and Development Act 2000.The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which came into operation in January 2007, amended the 2000 Act to provide for a streamlined, single-stage consent process for certain classes of nationally important infrastructural development undertaken by statutory bodies and private promoters.  These include heavy and light rail and metro, other infrastructure requiring environmental impact assessments such as significant airport or port developments, waste infrastructure, and major energy infrastructure such as electricity transmission lines, strategic upstream and downstream gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas facilities, oil refineries and large onshore wind farms.Since January 2007 the Board has received 19 applications for development consent in respect of strategic infrastructure projects.  Of these 8 have been determined, in each case following an oral hearing.  Consent was granted in 6 cases and refused in 1 case; 1 application was withdrawn.General information on the Board's workload and performance including the number of appeals referred to it and cases determined is available in their 2007 Annual Report, a copy of which is available on their website www.pleanala.ie.

This level of exchequer investment is expected to assist up to 12,000 homeowners in 2009.  While the precise details of the scheme have not been finalised, the pilot phase provided assistance of up to 30% of the cost of eligible measures and the national scheme can be expected to provide a similar level of incentive.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The Government is committed to making the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy and will be developing further measures to tackle climate challenge, reduce our purchases of carbon credits and reduce emissions.Fundamental to the Government's climate change agenda is accelerated energy efficiency across the economy and delivery of renewable energy technologies, together with the necessary related investment in the distribution and transmission system.  The incentivisation of energy efficiency and renewable energy is therefore a key priority for the Government as reflected in Budget Day announcements.We introduced a new tax incentive measure under section 46 of the Finance Act 2008 to encourage companies to purchase the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment for use within their business.Existing categories include lighting, lighting controls, motors, variable speed drives and building energy management systems.  The Minister for Finance has also signalled his intention to expand the range of technologies covered by the scheme in the forthcoming Finance Bill.The Home Energy Saving Scheme is a key initiative which was introduced as a pilot scheme this year.  The scheme will provide grants to householders to improve the energy performance of their homes.  We have provided €20 million in the Budget to roll out the Scheme nationally in 2009.The rollout of the national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government, with the pilot phase launched on 15 September.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of our strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.The costs of the pilot to year end will be approximately €6m.  As part of the preparation for the ‘go live' of the pilot, the Commission for Energy Regulation is currently considering submissions from the ESB on the budget for the entire pilot phase.My Department, together with ESB and EirGrid has kept the question of additional pumped storage facilities under review.  The ground-breaking All Island Grid Study, jointly commissioned by my Department and DETI in Northern Ireland showed, for a level of renewable electricity up to 42% on the system, with the scheduled of the East/West interconnector by 2012, that no further pumped storage is required.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The statistics in relation to Ireland's energy imports underline the imperative need to reduce the national dependence on fossil fuels.The Government is committed to delivering on ambitious targets for accelerated development of renewable energy, which will progressively, and sustainably, reduce our dependence on imported oil and gas.  Installed wind powered electricity generation capacity has now reached 915 megawatts and is set to reach over 1000 megawatts by the end of this year.  As wind power penetration increases we are on target for 15% of our electricity to come from renewable resources by 2010.  This is set to rise to 40% by 2020, assuming a consistent build rate of the necessary infrastructure.In parallel with this drive to create a supply of energy from our own sustainable resources, the Government's Energy Policy Framework highlighted the need for longer term strategies to reduce over reliance on gas imports from the UK, from where Ireland currently imports around 95% of gas.  Gas in the UK system currently comes from the North Sea, Norway and the Netherlands.  I am advised that it is estimated that around 1% of the gas in the UK system is of Russian origin.  The actions set out in the Framework include long term strategic planning by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in relation to security of gas supply and working within the European Union to deliver fully integrated regional gas markets for Northern Europe as well as diversification of supply.In this context, the CER has licensed Marathon Oil to operate 7 billion cubic feet of their depleted Kinsale field as a gas storage facility.  Bord Gáis Éireann is contracted to use 5 billion cubic feet of this facility.  On foot of the identification in the All Island Energy Market Framework of the need for an All Island approach to increased gas storage, further options are being examined arising from a study jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.Internationally, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming a key part of strategies to ensure security of gas supply by improving connectivity of individual states to the global gas market.  Therefore, another welcome market development is the plan by Shannon LNG — a wholly owned Irish subsidiary of Hess LNG Ltd — to build a terminal near Tarbert on the Shannon estuary.The Corrib field, when in full production, will significantly reduce our reliance on imports during its lifespan, with 60% of annual and 40% of peak demand estimated to be met for around 6 years from time the supply is expected to start to decline.  However, it is thought that significant potential exists for further substantial oil and gas finds in Irish waters.  Encouraging further exploration activity in the Irish offshore zone is a key priority.The robustness of existing and planned gas and electricity interconnection with the UK, and potentially with other European countries, is and will be critical, not only for Ireland's security of energy supply, but also for our future potential as an exporter of renewable energy.  The current electricity interconnection capacity with Northern Ireland of 300 megawatts will be doubled with the building of the second north/south electricity interconnector.  In addition, EirGrid, is progressing to schedule the building of the 500 megawatt electricity interconnector with the UK.  The targeted completion date for both projects is 2012 subject to the necessary planning approvals.In 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, 63% of Ireland's oil imports were sourced from the UK, with crude accounting for 7% and refined products accounting for 93% of these imports.  In the same year Norway accounted for 22% of our oil imports, of which crude accounted for 93% and refined products 7%.  The remaining 15% was mostly made up from crude imported from Denmark.  The Irish downstream industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  The strategic review of the security of Ireland's access to commercial oil supplies commissioned by my Department earlier this year, has recently been finalised.  I intend to publish the review shortly.  My Department has in place contingency arrangements to deal with oil supply disruptions.  As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Ireland would be entitled to its share of available IEA oil stock in the event of a significant oil supply disruption.

In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is nearing completion.  The NBS is designed to deliver broadband to areas where the market has failed to provide services.  Two bids, from Eircom Limited and Hutchinson 3G Ireland, have been received in response to the NBS invitation to tender and are being evaluated.  The preferred bidder is expected to be appointed shortly and the contract is expected to be signed this month.Subject to agreement with the chosen service provider, rollout of services is expected to begin shortly after the contract is signed.  The chosen service provider will be required to complete the roll out of services within 22 months of the contract award.  All requests for a broadband service in the areas to be addressed by the NBS, including any unserved areas in County Monaghan, will be met.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	808	I propose to take Questions Nos. 487 and 501 together.Arklow Harbour Commissioners applied in February 2007 for a Dumping at Sea permit to facilitate dredging at Arklow Harbour and the application was circulated to my Department's consultees in the normal way.  My Department was advised by the Marine Institute that the results of a chemical analysis of samples from the proposed area to be dredged showed high levels of contamination, principally from Copper and Zinc, and that the material was not suitable for direct disposal at sea.The Marine Institute has held direct discussions with the consultant engineers acting for Arklow Harbour Commissioners with a view to arriving at a possible solution to the current difficulties.  However, the Marine Institute has advised my Department that it continues to have concerns regarding the disposal of contaminated spoil arising from dredging at Arklow Harbour.At a meeting held on 19 June 2008 between the Harbour Commissioners, the Marine Institute and an official of my Department, the Commissioners agreed to re-examine the proposal to dredge the harbour having regard to the issues raised in relation to the contaminated sediment.  This examination will include consideration of appropriate alternative dredging and disposal methods in order to ensure safe disposal of the dredged material.  When that examination has been completed, my Department, in conjunction with its specialist advisors, will assess any revised proposal submitted in relation to dredging of the harbour.It is not possible to say at this stage what the eventual outcome of this application will be and the need to consider disposal options other than by Dumping at Sea cannot be ruled out.

I have asked that body to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	812	Sea Fishing Boat Licences issued by the independent Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats are not area-specific.  Any Irish commercial sea-fishing vessel may engage in commercial sea fishing activities in EU non-precluded waters in accordance with the licensing conditions attaching to its sea fishing boat licence and may use the facilities of any one of the 6 Fishery Harbours, or any other harbour in the State, in accordance with the requirements of their individual fishing operations.There is no licensing condition requiring a vessel to use a specific harbour as a general matter, although certain harbours are designated for the landing of specified quantities of certain species, for control purposes.The number of Irish registered commercial sea fishing vessels for the years concerned is as follows:(1) Year 2003: 1,528(2) Year 2004: 1,438(3) Year 2005: 1,421(4) Year 2006: 1,811(5) Year 2007: 1,935

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	815	The Single Payment in Ireland is based on the ‘Historical Model'.  This means that the Single Payment Scheme is applicable to farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002, who were paid Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid in one or more of those years and who will continue to farm in 2005 and onwards.  The gross Single Payment is based on the average number of animals and/or the average number of hectares (in the case of Arable Aid) on which payments were made in the three reference years.  Single Payment entitlements in respect of dairy production are based on the number of litres of milk quota held by the farmer on 31st March 2005.As the person named only commenced farming on 24 April 2006 he did not establish a Single Payment.The person named submitted an application under Category B of the 2008 National Reserve that caters for farmers who entered farming for the first time after 31 December 2005.  Other criteria that include on farm income, off farm income and educational qualification must also be met.  The person named did not submit sufficient documentation to fully process his application and my Department wrote to him on 15 October 2008 requesting additional information.  While the person named submitted some of the required documentation he did not submit all the information requested.  A further letter was issued to the person named on 4 November 2008 requesting the outstanding information.  When this information is received my Department will be in a position to finalise his application.

This equates to some 982,000 acres.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	817	An estimate of the market value of the forestry portfolio is provided.  I would emphasise that the results should be treated as indicative only and a more detailed valuation model supported by economic analysis and market research would be required to provide a more robust estimate of market value.As differing valuation methods were used to arrive at an estimate of market value for each of the main forest categories in the table, it is neither appropriate or correct to simply add these estimates to provide an overall estimate of market value.  Rather, each category should be treated as a more or less separate entity.  Notwithstanding this proviso, there are strong similarities between how private forest crops planted 1981-2008 and state forests are valued.ItemDescriptionNPV€ Million1State Forests 20081,355.162Private Forests 1981-2008 including Premiums1,574.103Private Forests pre 1981 Conifers112.174Private Forests pre 1981 Broadleaves280.74

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation.EU beef labelling legislation requiring country of origin labelling of beef has been in place since September 2000.  As this legislation did not cover beef sold by the catering trade my Department collaborated with the Department of Health & Children to have national legislation enacted to require that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. The EU Commission has considered this additional information in the context of the EU Labelling Directive but considers that it does not justify the introduction of national legislation. At the relevant standing committee meeting on food law on 13th October, the EU Commission outlined its decision not to agree to Ireland's proposed regulations.The European Commission is currently carrying out an overall review of food labelling legislation.  In this context Ireland has proposed that origin labelling for meat products should be mandatory and also raised the issue of substantial transformation.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The Public Service Benchmarking Body was established as an independent body in July 2000 under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison with the private sector. The Body reported in June 2002 and recommended varying levels of pay increases for the grades examined. The Benchmarking Body, in their first report, recommended that, apart from the first quarter of the award, the payment of the balance should be dependent on real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, flexibility and change. This was endorsed by the social partners in successive Partnership Agreements. It was also agreed that the final two phases of the benchmarking increases should be conditional on satisfactory implementation of the modernisation agenda and the maintenance of industrial relations stability.Towards 2016 sets out a mechanism for the verification of progress at sectoral, organisational and grade level in the civil service through the establishment of Civil Service Performance Verification Groups.  Under the terms of the agreement, the CSPVG is required to satisfy itself on progress in relation to co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with the satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement, the maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement before recommending the pay increases provided for under the agreement.My Department is responsible for the development and delivery of a wide range of customer-oriented policy initiatives and services, and all of the improvements made in these areas in recent years are listed in the Actions Plans and Progress Reports that were submitted to the CSPVG under the Partnership Agreements. Copies of the Reports and of the CSPVG responses in respect of my Department are available on their website at www.cspvg.gov.ie.The benefits arising to my Department from the benchmarking and associated Partnership processes are detailed in those reports. In general, they include the development of a more performance-oriented culture, an improved focus on accountability with closely defined responsibilities, and a better use of ICT with the development of a wider and more customer-oriented range of on-line services.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	823	Consideration by my Department of the applications is at a very advanced stage and a determination on the applications is imminent.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The person named applied for an allocation under Category A of the 2007 National Reserve which caters for farmers who inherited, leased or otherwise received free of charge, or for a nominal amount from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 a holding that was leased out to a third party during the 2000-2002 reference period.As the person named did not submit sufficient information initially in order to process his application, my Department wrote to him requesting the outstanding documentation.  All of the required documentation has now been received from the person named and his case has been finalised.The person named has been deemed successful for an allocation from the National Reserve and a formal letter outlining the allocation has issued to him.  Relevant payments due will issue shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in all of the detail requested and, insofar as it is available, 2006 is the most recent year for which detailed information can be provided in the time available.The total cost of the TB programme in 2006 was approximately €70 million, of which some €33.8 million related to staff costs. A specific figure for the cost of farm inspection, which includes epidemiological investigations as well as visits by agricultural officers, is not available. However, the cost of travel and subsistence, most of which relates to visits to farms by veterinarians and agricultural officers, amounted to €2.6m in 2006. Expenditure on compensation amounted to €16.6m, of which €13.3m related to the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme. Expenditure on the badger removal strategy was €2.6m and the cost of tuberculin testing paid for by the Department amounted to €12.7m.The number of TB reactors in Ireland in 2006 was  24,173  or 260 per 100,000 animals tested. Approximately 37.7% of reactor cattle slaughtered here had visible lesions observed at post mortem in 2006. In this connection, I should explain that a detailed post-mortem is not conducted on all animals removed as reactor; rather a fitness for human consumption examination in accordance with EU requirements is carried out at the slaughter plant.  The position, therefore, is that many cattle exposed to and actually infected with TB are slaughtered as reactors without any visible lesions being observed. This is normal in view of the fact that the development of lesions occurs at the later stages of the disease process and where the examination for TB lesions is done as part of a routine slaughter at commercial "kill" speeds and where tuberculin testing is conducted at an annual frequency. In effect, the sensitivity of this examination is inherently significantly lower than the tuberculin test, which is the definitive TB test.There is limited information available to me on the TB situation in the other countries in which the Deputy expressed interest. In particular, I have no information on the number of reactors which had visible lesions at slaughter. However, France and Germany and certain parts of Italy are officially free from bovine TB. From the information available to me, only 6 herds were reported in Germany as infected during 2006. There were 104 infected herds reported in France and Italy reported no infected herds in 2006.The TB eradication programme in Ireland is substantially designed to facilitate trade under the rules of the EU trade Directive 64/432/EEC, which requires Member States where the herd incidence of bovine TB is higher than 1% to test all of the herds in the country annually. Accordingly, since the incidence of TB in Ireland is above 1%, it is not open to us to implement a three yearly testing programme. Most of the other European countries apart from the UK and Spain are free to test less frequently because they have a lower incidence of the disease. I should point out that the annual testing programme is necessary for the continued export of live cattle and the programme has facilitated the growth of the Irish cattle industry over the years by creating and enhancing export opportunities and by improving the productivity of cattle rearing. In effect, our export trade in cattle and beef, which was worth €1.8 billion in 2006, is dependent on the effective implementation of the programme. There are also public health benefits from implementing the programme.While there has been a significant reduction in the incidence of bovine TB in Ireland over the past 10 years, progress in eradicating the disease in Ireland is severely impeded by the presence of TB infection in wildlife, particularly badgers. The Irish experience in this regard has been consistent with that of other countries, such as South Africa, New Zealand, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, where wildlife vectors also play a critical role in the maintenance of the disease in cattle. Infection in wildlife was not an issue in other EU member states, which have successfully eradicated the disease. The development of a vaccine for badgers is a prerequisite for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland. My Department has just commenced a large-scale field trial of BCG to test the efficacy of a vaccine.   However, any vaccine will not be available in the immediate future and the existing strategy will remain in place for some time.  In the meantime, the existing programme, updated as appropriate in light of developments, will remain in place.My Department continues to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease.

The balancing 25% payment will follow when all 2008 REPS on-farm inspections have taken place.  Work on the administrative checks is at an advanced stage but cannot be completed until industrial action in a number of my Department's local offices is resolved.  I am hopeful for an early resolution of the issues affected the release of REPS 4 payments.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	829	I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 and 510 together.Agricultural Officers in DAFF, members of the IMPACT union, commenced an industrial action on 6th October.  IMPACT allege that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has acted in breach of ‘Towards 2016' by not informing the Union in advance of changes in work practices.  The Department rejects this allegation. IMPACT has instructed its members:To work to rule;Not to undertake overtime;Not to undertake tasks or functions associated with posts which have not been filled;Not to participate in or cooperate with activities connected to what IMPACT term ‘imposed changes';Not to attend meetings with sectional management.The issues involved have now been referred to the Labour Relations Commission by the National Implementation Body, with a view to achieving a swift resolution.  A number of meetings have now been held with the Labour Relations Commission and these discussions are ongoing.  The Department is also monitoring the effect of the industrial action on the processing of payments under the range of schemes, and is seeking to ensure the prompt delivery of these payments.

Full planning permission for this development was received in July 2008.  In June 2008, my Department utilised existing available accommodation in its Regional Office in Mullingar to decentralise a section comprising seven posts from Dublin to that location.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	836	There are currently over 5,800 learning support/resource teachers supporting children with special education needs at primary level. In addition, there are over 1,200 teachers in special schools as well as the many hundreds of teachers in special classes for children with different disabilities.As the Deputy is aware, my Department implemented a general allocation system of learning support/resource teachers to mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The system provides teaching resources to schools to enable them to cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs such as borderline mild general learning disability, mild general learning disability and specific learning disability.Primary schools enrolling a child with a low incidence special educational need may apply to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for additional resource teaching hours.  The number of hours is determined by the nature of the special educational need.   The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All second level schools in the free education/block grant schemes have an entitlement to an ex-quota teacher allocation in respect of remedial/learning support teaching and guidance provision. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, the school may apply to the NCSE for additional teaching support.  The number of hours allocated will vary depending on the nature of the special educational need.  2,765 whole time equivalent additional teacher posts are allocated to post primary schools or the 2008/09 school year to support pupils with special educational needs.The total number of places available on the Special Educational Needs programmes run by the education colleges for the 2008/2009 academic year is 509.

The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.

The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for all of the individual schools in County Mayo, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.

Primary schools with between three and eight (inclusive) non-English speaking pupils receive grant assistance of €6,348 while schools with between 9 and 13 such pupils receive grant assistance of €9,523. In the current school year grant assistance has been provided to approximately 415 primary schools.My Department is providing support and training for teachers of English as an additional language in the current school year. A dedicated team within the Primary Professional Development Service (PPDS) is in place for the provision of support at primary level and the first of days of training is currently ongoing. Design and provision of the second day will take place in early 2009.At post primary level, the Second Level Support Service (SLSS) have identified members of their team to provide training and support for teachers of English as an additional language. The training has been designed and will be rolled out in early 2009.The budget for the PPDS in 2008 is €257,000 excluding personnel costs and the budgets for next year have not yet been finalised but I expect they will be in the coming weeks.  It is estimated that in the region of 28,000 children in first and second level schools benefited from English language support in the 2007/2008 school year.The Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Science is evaluating the effectiveness of provision of English as an additional language in a number of primary and post-primary schools. This evaluation is currently underway in a number of primary and post-primary schools and is designed to:Evaluate the quality of teaching and learning of English as an additional language which students receive in mainstream education and in support contextsEstablish the quality of whole-school planning and school self-review that is undertaken to include students in the school, and to review the extent to which this planning reflects the principles of inclusion and respect for cultural diversityReview the progress which these students are making in oracy, literacy and numeracyIdentify good practice with regard to EAL provision in schools and seek to disseminate this good practice generallyIdentify areas where the work of schools, teachers and the system of supports that the Department of Education and Science administers could be improved.It is envisaged that the data from the evaluations in the individual schools will be analysed in spring 2009 and a national composite report will be prepared by the Inspectorate. This report will, I hope, provide valuable reflections and analysis about how schools and the Department of Education and Science can improve the quality of EAL provision.In addition, materials have been provided to schools to raise awareness of cultural diversity and to support all staff in schools in addressing this issue effectively. The Intercultural Guidelines prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment help to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools are equipped to provide a welcoming, inclusive and supporting environment for newcomer children.  The assessment of the individual needs of pupils and the regular monitoring of the progress that they are making are key factors in ensuring that the school provides the most appropriate supports to the students. To assist schools in this work, the Department of Education and Science has supplied a language assessment kit for primary level and a post-primary kit is in preparation. The Department is supporting their use through training of teachers. Training is in place at primary level and in-service seminars are currently being delivered across the country.The Department of Education and Science recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to newcomer students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision and is, therefore, undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools.The ESRI will shortly produce a research report on "Managing Diversity", looking at newcomer students in primary and post-primary schools. This research is based on case study interviews and responses to questionnaires from over 1000 primary and post-primary schools.Ireland is also taking part in an OECD thematic review on migrant education, results from which are expected next year. Together with the other key participants in the study (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Flemish Community of Belgium) the review is exploring what are the best education options for our children in an inclusive Ireland.The Department of Education and Science is also conducting a value for money review of English as an Additional Language in primary and post-primary schools. The review is expected to be completed in 2009.

The name of the subject was changed to Design and Communications Graphics and the new subject was introduced in September 2007, into a number of selected Post-Primary schools, for examination for the first time by the State Exams Commission (SEC) in June 2009.When schools were initially assessed for the new syllabus, this school did not have a cohort of pupils at Leaving Certificate in September 2007 to whom the new Design and Communications Graphics course could be offered. In these circumstances the school was not considered for the first phase of introduction of the new syllabus.My Department has very recently received an application from the school in question seeking funding to introduce the new course from September 2009. The extension of this syllabus into further schools, including this school, will be considered for funding early in the new year and the school informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.The Department is also currently consulting extensively on the development of an intercultural education strategy which is to be finalised in 2009. The research work findings and the responses to the consultation process will provide the evidence based data required to prepare the strategy.

The figures, both for increases and decreases in the estimated number of teaching posts, are related to the possible impact of changes to the staffing schedules and the effectiveness of redeployment as part of the detailed allocation process to individual schools.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements.

As is normal, the school's consultant architect provided certification relating to satisfactory progress at various stages of the works.  The architect did not require permission from my Department to issue these certificates.  My Department funded the school, who were the party to the contract, on receipt of the certification to enable payments to be made to the contractor as required under the terms of the contract between the school and the contractor.Officials from my Department met with the school management to discuss the situation which arose and urged the school to comply with the terms of the contract regarding payment due to the contractor.  I understand that the school subsequently met with the consultant architect and exchanged correspondence with the contractor regarding the release of money and the completion of works on the project.  It is anticipated that the works will be completed shortly.

I have no plans for change in the implementation of these programmes at present.In framing the budget this year, a range of very difficult policy choices had to be faced by the Government across all areas of public expenditure, including in the field of education. While education remains a priority for the Government, it has been necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas.  Among the areas affected are the Junior Certificate School Programme and the Leaving  Certificate Applied where the special grant has been ceased.  However, I would like to emphasise that the capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by4.3%, representing an increase of €14 per student, to bring it to €345 per student from January 2009.In addition, voluntary secondary schools will benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per student from January 2009.  This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 students will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.I am confident that the Junior Certificate School Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied will continue to be viable options for students.

Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.For some pupils, as they mature, their care needs may diminish over time.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to a post-primary school.  In such circumstances, the NCSE will review and adjust the overall level of SNA support in the school concerned.  This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.The recent budgetary announcements do not affect the criteria used for the allocation of special needs teaching and care resources for children with special educational needs.  The National Council for Special Education continues to operate within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.

The Scheme, which consisted of 3 strands, was a voluntary scheme.  Like other programmes under my Department's remit, the continuance of the pilot scheme is subject to available resources and to changes in Government policy.  While the scheme has proven to be a useful management tool in the school system in the past, the current budgetary constraints mean that sometimes difficult decisions must be taken in order to meet the economic challenges faced by the country.  My Department does not accept that any issue of legitimate expectation arises.

This applies to the progression of all preparatory work leading up to the construction phase.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  The project for the school in question carries a Band 2 rating.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department and with the level of activity in the School Building Programme, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the project at this time.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Department must, in the first instance, manage its resources to ensure that the projects which are in the programme are delivered.

It allowed plenty of space for the range of activities carried out under the modern school curriculum in times before the staffing schedule for primary teachers was reduced and therefore will not need to be adjusted in light of the current adjustment in the staffing schedule.  80 sq. metres is considered to be the optimum size of classroom and was determined by studies carried out by my Department and in line with international best practice. Older classrooms may be of a smaller size but may have some of the above activities outside of the classroom.GRD buildings provide the full range of classroom and ancillary accommodation that is achieved using the traditional design method. GRD buildings facilitate speedier delivery of projects, save on design fees and are designed to allow for easy extension if required at a later stage.

I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to my statement on that date that it is my intention to make a further announcement in the first quarter of 2009 on further major primary and post-primary school projects to proceed to construction.The content of that announcement will take account of the funds available to my Department, the trend in the cost of such projects as well as the relative priority of need for the projects under consideration.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know  where they stand.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for all of the individual schools requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.

As  stated in the programme, the parties were committed to full and ongoing  co-operation with change, continued adaptation and flexibility and the delivery  of the modernisation programme in the public service. Consequently, the payment  of the second, and subsequent phases of the increases recommended by the Public  Service Benchmarking Body were dependent, in the case of each Civil Service  organisation and grade, on verification, by the Civil Service Performance  verification Group (CSPVG), of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing  change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation,  maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in  respect of any matters covered by the PPF's successor, Sustaining Progress.Progress Reports on my Department's Action Plan submitted to the CSPVG are  available on the Department of Finance website.Benefits which have accrued to the general public under my Department's  Modernisation Programme include:The establishment of the State Examinations Commission;The establishment of the National Council for Special Education;The establishment of a Regional Office Network within the Department;The integration of services at Primary and Post-Primary level;The roll out of the On Line Claims system — the Department's e-Government  project;The transition to Whole School Evaluation as the main form of inspection;The publication of school inspection reports;The use of generic designs to streamline the delivery of building projects;Improved planning — establishment of Area Development Plans;Establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS);Implementation of the Department's action plan for addressing educational  disadvantage — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS);Implementing the Department's commitments as outlined in 2005-2008 scheme under Section 11 of the Official Languages Act.

This category would also have  included summer works type projects.Since 2004 the emergency works grant scheme is one of a number of component  elements or sub programmes of the capital allocation. The other elements  include Large Scale Building Projects (new school buildings and major  extensions/refurbishments); Site Acquisitions; Remediation Programmes (asbestos  removal, radon mitigation); Furniture and Equipment; provision of Temporary  Accommodation etc.  The level of funding allocated to each element of the  building programme for 2009, including emergency works, will be decided later  in the year.In the light of the large number of projects seeking funding under this scheme  and the competing demands on the budget allocated, it was not possible to  provide funding for all applications received this year.The level of funding approved in the period 2004 to 2007 and the number of  projects approved are given in the following tabular statement.No. of Projects ApprovedEstimated cost at time of approval€m20041304.531200524512.295200647630.474200762750.607

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	886	In the interest of rational arrangements for the purposes of educational provision, the country generally was divided into geographic districts (catchment areas) each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. These areas were drawn up in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. Parish boundaries, deanery areas etc. would not have been a determining factor in drawing up catchment areas. In major urban areas it is not possible to do a similar exercise as for the rest of the country.The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly  planning of school provision and accommodation needs. A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres. Catchment boundaries may have to be adjusted where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolments.Enrolment in individual post-primary schools is the responsibility of the  managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to  intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main  responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater  for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not  in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment  policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of  management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a  particular area or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. It is  not unusual for some second-level schools to prioritise named feeder schools in  their admissions policies. This often reflects long standing connections  between certain schools.However, in formulating an admissions policy a school must ensure that it is  lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal  Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools  from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including  the admission of a pupil to the school.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and  to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure  could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding  profiles for all of the individual schools requested by the Deputy, information  which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would  in fact impede the process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	892	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  While the education sector was protected to a much greater extent than other areas of public expenditure, it is also affected.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget Day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.  That said it should be noted that the recent budgetary announcements do not affect the criteria used for the allocation of teaching resources to the school in question.  Likewise, while I appreciate that the abolition of a range of grants may have some impact on funding to the school in question, it should be noted that this school is funded on an annual budget system which is used to meet the costs of expenditure for pay costs in the case of non-teaching staff, and also the day-to-day running costs.  The school furnishes my Department with an estimate of its budgetary requirements for the year.  The school's  budget is determined on the basis of the previous year's spending, taking into account such things as incremental progression and any increases due under national pay agreements in pay expenditure and inflation in relation to non-pay expenditure.  This process will commence shortly for the 2009 calendar year.  With regard to the detailed information requested by the Deputy, it is not possible to compile this in the time available but I have asked my officials to send this directly to him as soon as possible.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	893	It is not possible to compile the detailed information requested by the Deputy in the time available but I have asked my officials to send this to him directly as soon as possible.  However, I can say that the recent budgetary announcements do not affect the criteria used for the allocation of teaching resources to the school in question.  Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions were outlined in the Budget day announcements and included the abolition of a number of specialist grants for primary and post-primary schools.We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.  Overall some €20 million has been allocated to improving the capitation and ancillary funding for schools.While I appreciate that the abolition of a range of grants will make it a challenging year ahead, most of the available funding was used to increase the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil.  The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil.  I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit and I am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel rather than have disparate grant schemes, thereby giving schools more flexibility and discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities based on its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the students it serves.  There is the added advantage that administration and accounting can be reduced for schools and my Department.  The Budget measures will help ensure that Ireland is well positioned to benefit when the global economy improves and we can start to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

Diverting resources in order to compile either historic information or to create staffing or funding profiles for all of the individual schools requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to take Questions Nos. 783 and 874 together.The recent budgetary announcements do not affect the criteria used for the allocation of additional teaching and care resources for children with special educational needs.  My Department interacts with more than 3,200 primary schools, including special schools, on many day to day issues including their staffing allocation and grant payments.  It is not possible to compile the information requested by the Deputy at individual school level given the inordinate amount of time it would take and balanced against the many other competing demands on my Department's resources.Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions were outlined in the Budget day announcements and included the abolition of a number of specialist grants for primary and post-primary schools.  We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.  Overall some €20 million has been allocated to improving the capitation and ancillary funding for schools.In relation to day-to-day funding for schools, I prioritised the funding for primary schools in particular recognising the submissions made by the management bodies.  The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.While I appreciate that the abolition of a range of grants will make it a challenging year ahead most of the available funding was used to increase the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil.  The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil.  I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit and I am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel rather than have a plethora of grant schemes, thereby giving schools more flexibility and discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities based on its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the students it serves.  There is the added advantage that administration and accounting can be reduced for schools and my Department.The Budget measures will help ensure that Ireland is well positioned to benefit when the global economy improves and we can start to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included  in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.

The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management, however their collection should be such as not to create a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.In relation to day to day funding for schools I prioritised funding for primary schools in the recent budget.  While I appreciate that the abolition of a range of grants will make it a challenging year ahead most of the available funding was used to increase the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil.  The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil. While I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit, I am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel for schools, thereby giving schools more flexibility and discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities based on its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the students it serves.

These decisions included reductions on the aid for school books scheme which in the case of schools outside of the DEIS scheme will involve savings of approximately €7.5 million on current levels.Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools for the aid for school books scheme and this fund of €7 million will be made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.

My Department is working with agencies funded through the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to improve the quality of childcare and education in DEIS pre-school areas and to work with these agencies on prioritising disadvantaged areas.
