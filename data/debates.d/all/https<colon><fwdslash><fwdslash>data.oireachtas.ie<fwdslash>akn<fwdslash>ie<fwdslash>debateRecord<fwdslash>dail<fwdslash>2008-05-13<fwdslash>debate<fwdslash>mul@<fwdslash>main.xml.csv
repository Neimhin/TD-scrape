#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and 121 together.A total of 32 staff currently serving out of the authorised core staffing complement of 193 in my Department have applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme.  The breakdown by grade is one principal officer, five assistant principals, three higher executive officers, seven administrative officers, six executive officers, one staff officer and nine clerical officers.A total of 16 former members of staff have already been assigned to decentralised posts.  It is a matter for those Departments to which staff from my Department have decentralised to assign such staff to locations outside of Dublin.  The Deputy will be aware that there are no proposals to decentralise my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis and, accordingly, the information sought regarding cost of decentralisation does not apply.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thought after last weekend the Department might be decentralised to the midlands but this does not seem to be the case.  With regard to the 32 members of staff who have applied for transfer to other Departments, what is the position with regard to those Departments being decentralised?  I assume it may well be based on general, geographical, home or family circumstances and where staff may prefer to work.  Will the 32 individuals in question be replaced when they are transferred or decentralised?The Taoiseach's predecessor invited the OECD to do an analysis and report on the decentralisation programme in general.  In very polite language the OECD report clearly indicated the programme is in a complete shambles.  The Taoiseach can see, as I and others also can, the benefits of a planned and well managed decentralisation programme in a town in his constituency.  It is perfectly obvious, however, that there is a complete blockage in the programme through which 10,000 public servants were to be decentralised to 53 locations inside three years.One of the key tenets of the OECD report is that 90% of persons working in Departments or agencies could be affected by decentralisation, the central point being that there will be a complete fragmentation of the collective memory of the public service in the Departments in question.  Does the Taoiseach share the view that if one could, in theory, implement the entire decentralisation programme in the morning, which will obviously not happen, the collective capacity and memory of the public service being dissipated over such a large area into such small fragmented pieces would not provide the capacity for public service reform and delivery, of which the Taoiseach has rightly spoken in the recent past?  What is the story regarding the OECD report commissioned by the Taoiseach's predecessor which has more or less said the decentralisation programme envisaged by the Government has not worked to date and, given the figures it cites, is unlikely to work?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The OECD has not said that.  The Deputy did not give a fair reading of the situation.  The OECD was not asked to comment on any Government policy, including decentralisation.  The report makes the point that the ambitious and voluntary decentralisation programme is challenging and the Government accepts that is the case.  There has been significant progress in the programme.  To date, approximately 2,200 posts have been relocated and decentralising organisations have established a presence in 34 locations.  More than 11,000 civil and public servants have applied on the Central Applications Facility to decentralise, of whom more than 6,000 or 55% are based in Dublin.  The facility remains open and continues to receive applications.  Some 2,200 posts have been moved and a further 1,200 Civil Service staff have been assigned to decentralising posts and are being trained in their new role in advance of their move.  Taking account of both the moves and assignments, almost 50% of the Civil Service general service posts have moved or have staff in place with a commitment to move.  The comparable figure for the Civil Service professional and technical staff is 25% and the indications are that it is in the order of 20% for the State agency sector.Decentralisation is a voluntary programme.  Difficulties have arisen in the State agency sector because it does not share a culture established in the Civil Service in which cross-pollination of staff among Departments is regarded as acceptable.  We have been asked on foot of the Labour Court recommendations in the FÁS case to engage with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on these matters.  ICTU indicated recently that the OECD report presents an opportunity to step back from the process, which is unfortunate.  The OECD does not state what the Deputy asserted but states the decentralisation programme is challenging.  It is not, as has been portrayed, a critique of the programme.  It is no such thing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The OECD would not be so direct.  However, it made points about better accountability mechanisms, appropriate information systems, revised procedures and mechanisms regarding staff mobility and effective methods and systems to evaluate and measure performance.  This is appropriate terminology for saying——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is not specific to the decentralisation programme but general.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	5	——there needs to be increased accountability and performance.  It says these needs will impose additional specific pressures on the Irish public service.  In light of the figure of 25% relating to technical staff mentioned by the Taoiseach, does he feel it is time to review what is left of the decentralisation programme?  I support a well-planned and well-managed decentralisation programme and can see the benefits of it in locations around the country.  However, the FÁS ICT unit has three people in Birr and six in Dublin.  These people must meet centrally to discuss their business because they have no broadband.  That seems to be a shambles.People from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which is the subject of questions later, must travel extensively from Killarney to Dublin because most of the bodies with which they deal are in the capital.  This obviously involves travel; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's carbon footprint emissions; travel expenses; and overnight stays in many cases.  We heard the Taoiseach's predecessor talk about multi-corporate companies operating on a worldwide basis with technology like videolinking and all modern means of communications.  Here we have a situation where people are travelling from Killarney by train or car to meet the bodies, most of which are based in Dublin, for discussions.  It does not seem to be the way to do business.As I said previously in respect of the ICT unit in FÁS, three people in Birr and six people in Dublin must meet centrally because they have no broadband.  That appears to be a complete shambles.  A total of 300 posts in Enterprise Ireland were to move to Shannon.  A recent survey shows that only seven internal applicants are interested in moving there, no disrespect to Shannon.  In respect of the move of the Health and Safety Authority to Thomastown in County Kilkenny, which involves 110 posts, only 12 people have expressed an interest.  The National Standards Authority is to relocate to Arklow, with a total of 132 posts.  A total of ten Dublin-based staff have said that they want to go there.  The Combat Poverty Agency is supposed to go to Monaghan town but no staff have yet moved and there is no indicative time as to when this will happen.  Bord Bia is to relocate to Enniscorthy but no staff have moved, no accommodation has been found and there is no indicative timeframe.As the Taoiseach is aware, this is a voluntary scheme.  Obviously, there are difficulties such as families, homes, schools and relationships.  Does he think there is a need for a complete re-evaluation of that element of the decentralisation programme in so far as State agencies are concerned?  This area is clearly proving to be much more difficult than the general public service.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	6	In respect of the State agency side of the equation, State agency moves in total account for 20% of the total programme.  So one fifth of the programme is in the State agency sector.  There have been specific industrial relations difficulties in respect of the State agency sector as a result of the case brought by FÁS and the unions in respect of a FÁS directive, which was decided upon by the Labour Court.  The union representatives decided not to engage until clarification was brought as a result of the FÁS case.  That has been clarified by the Labour Court, which indicated in its recommendation that it is a voluntary programme and that the agencies should engage for the purposes of scoping the extent to which a process can be undertaken which will enable those who wish to move to do so if that is possible.At the end of the day, it is the actual non-engagement because of the industrial relations issue in the background that is depriving us of coming to an assessment more quickly than would otherwise be the case regarding that matter.  I want to put it in perspective.  It is 20% of the programme.  It is a significant part of the programme but it is not all of it.  The FÁS situation in Birr is far better than Deputy Kenny suggests.  I invite him to call there some time when he will discover there are far more than three people working in FÁS here.  The suggestion was made that there were three people working in FÁS in Birr.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	In the ICT sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The suggestion that the ICT area is in abeyance in FÁS is wrong.  FÁS has come up with other solutions to deal with that problem, knowing there was an industrial relations issue regarding the relocation to Birr.  The responsibility is with management and COs working with the unions when they can and the terms of engagement can be agreed to move these things along.  It is moving more slowly than we would like but it was always a voluntary programme.  The best way of seeking to resolve and conclude these matters is to have engagement so we can scope the issues.The fact is that because of the industrial relations problems, people are stepping back from engagement, which is unfortunate.  At my last meeting with a SIPTU delegation, including Mr. O'Connor and others, we discussed this matter as candidly as possible in an attempt to find a way forward.  The State agency sector is not moving as quickly as we would like.  That is quite clear.  There are industrial relations issues and other difficulties.  It is a complex problem.  The Civil Service sector has been moving along quite well.  A total of 3,400 people have relocated or are assigned to relocate, which is a significant rate of progress.  We would like to see more and, indeed, more are on the way.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On a point of clarification, what I said was that in the ICT section of FÁS, there are three people in Birr and six in Dublin.  I recognise that there are more people working in FÁS in Birr in general.Arising from the clarification of the case in respect of FÁS, does the Taoiseach envisage a situation where negotiations or sit-down talks can take place?  Does he have a timescale in mind, when something might happen to bring this to a conclusion or will it be drifting continuously with speculation on dates, site purchases or building acquisitions continuing to fill local newspapers all over the country?  Will the Taoiseach review the situation or let it drift, in which case we will probably be asking him questions about this again in the future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	It is not a question of drift.  There is a proposal to decentralise and in the meantime, people get on with their work in their current location.  In fairness to those staff, for the purposes of trying to bring some clarification to what the organisational arrangements will be, it would be best if there was an engagement between staff and management so that they can scope the issue and try to come to some conclusions.  The problem is that there has not been a great degree of engagement because of the industrial relations background.  Now the OECD report is being used as a means to justify stepping back again but I do not see the benefit of that and I know the staff would like to have the issue clarified, one way or the other.  That would be better for everyone, including management and policy makers.  I am quite open about that.I would contend that the Labour Court recommendation on the dispute between FÁS and SIPTU provides a renewed opportunity for both unions and management to address the relevant issues.  There are issues to be addressed and I frankly acknowledge that.  My Department has been in contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish how progress can be made on this aspect of the recommendation.  I remain confident that through dialogue and negotiation, progress can be achieved.  Issues also arise regarding the decentralisation of Civil Service posts which are debated and talked through, solutions are found and the situation is moved on.  The problem on the State agency side, unfortunately, is that we are not getting that level of engagement, for reasons which were understandable from an industrial relations point of view.  Those issues have now been clarified.  I suggest people get down to discussing the problem rather than simply saying there is a problem and not being able to bring it any further.  Let us discuss the problem and determine to what extent we can address the issues and bring greater clarification to those employees who want to see the issue resolved.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Taoiseach said that the OECD was not asked for an opinion on decentralisation, which makes the opinion it did express all the more remarkable.  That opinion is pretty categoric.  The OECD argued that decentralisation would contribute to fragmentation of the public service.  It said it would pose significant challenges to modernisation and the ability to achieve an integrated, cohesive public service.  The organisation was quite damning in its criticism of the decentralisation plan.Is it still the Government's intention to proceed with the plan as announced originally by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, in 2003?  The original plan was that 10,000 civil servants would be decentralised to various locations around the country.  If it is the Government's intention to proceed with that plan, will the Taoiseach indicate the timescale for it now?  When it was announced, Mr. McCreevy said it would be completed by the end of 2006.  In fact, he said the Government would not deserve to be re-elected if that deadline was not met.  Clearly it has not been met.   Of the 10,000 or so civil servants who were to be decentralised, the Taoiseach has confirmed that to date 2,200 have moved, with another 1,200 somewhere in the pipeline.  Given what has happened with the plan and that most sensible people looking at it now realise that the original plans as announced by the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, will not materialise, will he agree it is time to carry out a stocktaking of the decentralisation plan in total, to carry out an audit, to see what is practically possible, to look at problems such as he has described with the State agencies?It is not just a case of industrial relations problems in the State agencies; the problem in some of the State agencies is that specialist people do not want to move.  If the Government wants to effect the decentralisation of some of these agencies, it will be necessary to create a new pool of specialist people in the place where they are to be relocated and then keep the existing specialists wandering around Dublin reading books or reading poetry rather than doing the job they were originally employed to do.  Is it not time to take a new look at the decentralisation plan, recast it and come up with something that is realistic rather than keep going on with the fiction that the original McCreevy plan will some day come to fruition?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	13	To be clear, Deputy Gilmore made a point about the OECD report and I refer to the interpretation he places on it.  The OECD has not criticised the decentralisation policy nor has it said it is a bad idea.  It said that if it is not properly implemented, if it is not carried out in a planned way, there could be the prospect of fragmentation.  I wish to be clear from the point of view of our experience.  Decentralisation has worked in this country.  The Deputy will know of many examples of where it has worked and it has all worked.  I know there was a time when Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided to call a halt to the decentralisation programme before Deputy Gilmore was a member of the Labour Party, but it was proved to be a wrong decision.The OECD has sounded a note of caution——
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	14	It has.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	15	——in the report, which I acknowledge.  The note of caution indicated that a longer-term plan is needed in how the decentralisation programme will affect performance and meet the needs of the public.  Such a plan would help to address the challenges decentralisation might present to further modernisation efforts.  We are mindful of the impacts that decentralisation could have on delivery of services if it is not implemented with due care and attention and that is the point made by the OECD report.  Of course if one does not go about it in the proper way, those worries and concerns arise, but we are going about it in a proper way because we have had the experience of less ambitious programmes in the past.  This is the most ambitious programme thus far.The decentralisation implementation group has always been aware of the business issues surrounding the relocation programme and, with that in mind, each organisation participating in the programme was asked to prepare detailed implementation plans, including risk mitigation plans.  On a number of occasions the group met individual Secretaries General and was satisfied with the level of planning in each Department.  To demonstrate the prudent approach, a number of Departments and offices moving their headquarters in full have put in place advanced parties to assist with the orderly hand-over of skills and knowledge and the retraining being carried out.   This is happening and it is going well.  I have opened offices for Revenue in a number of locations and for the Department of Finance, and these offices are working very well.  I invite the Deputy, anytime he is in those parts of the country, to call in and talk to the staff and senior management.  They are working well.The question of decentralisation is not new to the public service.  Previous programmes have built up considerable learning within the system.  The turnover of staff can and is being managed in a way that minimises risk.  That is a fairer assessment of what is happening.The second point raised by Deputy Gilmore was about the programme.  It was a very ambitious programme, as the Deputy said, and we still have those objectives.  The reason one could not come to the conclusion which Deputy Gilmore is asking me to accept is that we have not had sufficient engagement on the issues.  There has been a stand-off in some respects in areas of the programme, such as the State agencies sector, which makes up one fifth of the total programme.  I would like that engagement to take place so that we can perhaps come to some conclusions in these matters.  It is not fair to say to the Government that we should forget about decentralisation because there is non-engagement.  The Labour Court recommendation relating to best industrial relations practice not only suggests but indicates, on the basis of the clarification it gave in respect of promotions etc., that there is engagement so that we deal with the issues, see what are the business case issues and see whether risks can be mitigated.  This would be a far more intelligible and intelligent way of proceeding than simply having everyone stepping back all the time.  In the meantime, were one to do that, one would, perhaps, undermine those areas of the programme that are proceeding.  Some 1,000 people in the State agency sector have applied to the central applications facility for relocation.  In the same way as other public servants in that sector who do not wish to move and whose wishes should be respected, there are 1,000 who have indicated their wish to the contrary.  This should also be respected if it is possible to incorporate them in a systematic and sensible way to enable them to relocate.  That is a fair statement.If there are 1,000 people in the State agency sector who would like to be considered for relocation, it is not unreasonable to see in what way that might be accommodated and to see if others would also be interested.  If they are not, we will just have to address that issue and see what is the outcome.  The problem is that because of the IR background, which meant we could not proceed with this in the way we got on with the Civil Service unions, this issue has been left in abeyance somewhat.  I do not think it is fair to those 1,000 people who have indicated they would like to move in the same way as it would not be fair to those in the State sector who do not want to move and would be compelled to do so.  I am not interested in that sort of a programme and nor was Mr. McCreevy.  Mr. McCreevy mentioned 2007 as an indication of the sincerity of purpose of the Government to get on with this programme but it was always a voluntary programme.  One has to respect the IR process which is taking longer than would otherwise be the case.  In regard to the question of the Government losing office over it, he was clearly wrong in that assessment because the people had a different opinion.All I am saying is that if we could get co-operation at agency level and at all the relevant organisational unit level to discuss this matter intelligently and intelligibly, we could come to some more conclusions on it.  That is all I am saying and I think we should do that.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I remind the Taoiseach there are three legs to this particular stool.  It is not just a matter of what the Government wants and what the staff want or do not want and the issue being resolved in the traditional IR sense between two parties.  The third leg of this stool is the public interest.  There is a serious question here, and it is what the OECD referred to, regarding whether the decentralisation plan, as envisaged, is actually good for the service that is being delivered to the public and whether the taxpayer is getting value for money.  This issue has to be considered.  It is all very well to talk about engagement.  That is fine and I do not disagree with that approach, but for engagement to take place, there has to be some clarity about the Government's intentions at this stage.It is clear that the original McCreevy plan will not happen as it was envisaged.  It would be advisable for Government at this stage to relook at the decentralisation plan, recast it in a more realistic way and look at the problems, for example, of specialist agencies or specialist staff who manifestly are not going to move.  There is no point in dreaming on that it will happen.  It would be much better if a recast, more realistic decentralisation plan was devised and announced by Government rather than the fiction continuing that this will happen at some stage when clearly it will not.  In the meantime, staff who should be applying their minds to the job on hand and service to the public are focused on where they will be next year or in five years' time.Perhaps the Taoiseach would clarify one issue.  In the original McCreevy plan the intention was that the headquarters of eight Departments, including the Ministers' offices, were to be located in different places.  Is that still the intention?  For example, is it still the intention that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, with which you, a Cheann Comhairle, would have been familiar, is be located in Killarney?  It is the intention that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, will travel from Waterford to Killarney on a Monday morning and back up to Dublin on a Tuesday and continue going around in circles for whatever few months he will be left in that office?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The validity of the Deputy's comments falls away when he falls into this stereotypical argument, which is not envisaged.  It is envisaged that a core ministerial team will remain with the Minister to deal with his parliamentary and ministerial duties in Dublin.  That was always the intention.  The Deputy asked what was the problem with moving a headquarters.  There is no problem moving a headquarters.  One can move the headquarters of Bord na Móna from Newbridge to Tullamore or Portlaoise in the morning if one wants.  Headquarters can be set up outside this city.  Let us not fall into that trap.The public interest is an issue and we are making sure to decentralise, as we decentralised previously, in a way that does not take from the efficacy and the efficiency of output.  Recasting results from engagement.  For example, the Revenue Commissioners moved to Kildare.  Its ICT unit was supposed to move there but the commissioners had a discussion on this.  They came back to me as Minister and made a good business case that the move should not happen but other sections could move.  I had no problem accommodating that because a business case was made that it would be best not to do it that way following further detailed examination.  That is the good, sensible engagement about which I am talking.The immediate reaction was that decentralisation was being compulsorily imposed and we were riding roughshod over people's rights and entitlements.  I never agreed to, said or indicated that would happen.  We hoped in my part of the country, if the programme was implemented in full and in a timely fashion, that we would be a good beneficiary of it.  I was never of the view decentralisation would automatically happen and that it would have to happen through the usual ordinary industrial relations processes.  If that works out, it works out and that is still my position.  There are good examples of decentralisation around the country, including in my own constituency.  I can say that hand on heart because I know it to be the case.  The staff are tremendously happy there and they are doing excellent work.In the meantime where locations are earmarked, as the Deputy said, the staff are getting on with their work.  Their representative bodies are looking after their interests.  I would like more engagement but there is no suggestion of people needing to be distracted, that something is about to happen against their interests.  That certainly will not happen.  If the Deputy returned to his occupation, he would be well capable of doing this.Let us deal with the issues as they stand.  A total of 3,400 officials have moved or are ready to go.  In the State agency sector, 20% of staff or 1,000 officials have indicated to the CAF they would like to be considered for a move.  Whether that can be accommodated depends.  One of the best ways to sort this out in order that people are not left in an administrative limbo about whether they are moving is to get over the refusal to engage in the issues.  As Minister for Finance, I was as candid as possible giving whatever reassurance people required for that engagement to take place because I want a sensible outcome to all these issues.  However, we cannot do it on the basis of the dialogue of the deaf.  A Department should not be expected to walk away from a process that has not been given an opportunity to proceed.  Let us have the confidence of our positions and get into the process and let us get to the point the Deputy is discussing.

SIPTU, which represents 1,600 State agency employees, has called repeatedly on Government to abandon the proposed relocation of State agencies.  It has been said time and again that this is intended to be a voluntary process.  Does the Taoiseach accept that a very different situation applies to State agencies than to civil servants in Departments in which there is a degree of interchangeability?  Given the specific roles, responsibilities and expertise that State agencies require, there is not the same level of interchangeability.The last time the Taoiseach answered questions on this was last October as Minister for Finance.  He indicated to the House at that time that there was ongoing consideration and engagement and that a solution would and must be found.  On the basis of that commitment last October, what progress has been made eight months later in addressing this issue that continues to present itself and does not appear to be making much headway?  Can the Taoiseach give us some sense as to whether progress is being made in seeking a solution to this matter?  Where stands the Taoiseach now in relation to the proposals on the relocation of State agencies?I noted Deputy Kenny's reference to the FÁS IT unit located in Birr, in the Taoiseach's consistency, and in Dublin.  This issue was raised last Thursday at the annual conference of the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants in Croke Park in Dublin.  The information that has been cited appears to be the case, that in the absence of broadband, thereby not having the wherewithal to establish video-conferencing through information technology, people are obliged to travel to regular meetings and engagements and this results in added cost and places inconvenience on people who heretofore have worked on the same site.A number of solutions could be brought about to address this problem, not least of which is the universal roll-out of broadband access.  As these matters were addressed at the annual conference of the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants last Thursday, has the Taoiseach taken on board the criticisms it highlighted of the outworking of relocations that have already taken place?  What actions does he and his Department propose to take?I wish to follow on from what Deputy Gilmore said.  I do not think that Opposition Members want to make these points repeatedly but we are looking towards the tenth anniversary of Mr. McCreevy's announcement of an intended decentralisation of 10,000 civil servants and State agency workers.  Under the Taoiseach's new stewardship, is it not well past time to spell out a new realistic set of goals for that decentralisation plan so that we can put to bed much of the uncertainties that were created by Mr. McCreevy's assertion in his budget day speech a number of years ago?

The problem I have with some of this debate since it began is that people are talking out of both sides of their mouths.  They ask why it has not happened by now and in the meantime they are opposed to it.  Do people want civil and public servants to stay or to go?  People should take a position and then let us figure out how——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I am addressing the Deputy's questions.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I have been very clear.  I have supported the proposal from day one.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I can express an opinion in reply on what I believe is the Deputy's position.  I can do that in the House and the Deputy can stand up and disagree with me.  I do not have to be kowtowed to.  I could bring up the local newspapers, which inquire non-stop about when we will have decentralisation, but when I come into the House people tell me not to let it happen.I believe and know from experience that decentralisation is a plus, but there are legitimate issues that must be addressed if it is to happen.  The problem is we do not have the level of engagement to scope those issues to find out to what extent we can deal with them.  The best way to solve the problem is to engage in discussion and seek to resolve the issues.  As I said in response to Deputy Gilmore, where an issue arose in a business case suggesting there was another solution, another solution was found.  That did not mean decentralisation did not take place.  It was recast in a way that met with staff requirements and with the business case put by management.  It is possible to do these things.I am flexible and interested in trying to solve problems if they exist.  However, I cannot be asked to withdraw from a policy position on the basis there is no engagement, particularly when the Labour Court has indicated that the best way of dealing with the matter is by engaging with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions centrally on all of the issues across the agencies to see if we can come up with some solutions.  We do that with every other aspect of policy.  If Government sets a policy and there are legitimate stakeholder issues to be addressed, let us engage and discuss them.  The problem is this does not happen sufficiently.Some people represented in the organisations have indicated a willingness to move, but whether they move will depend on whether, having looked at all the issues, it is possible for them to be accommodated in their own or another organisation.  Those people are not being mentioned in the equation, but they are entitled to be represented, as we would all agree.  There is not unanimity on the issue, although a strong position has been put in industrial relations terms with regard to aspects of it.  I respect that position, but I cannot accept that as a result of that, in terms of the state of our industrial relations, we cannot sit down and discuss the issues.  In some respects we are at that point on some of the issues.  That is an unwarranted and unnecessary position in the context of whatever assurances I was able to give formerly as Minister for Finance with responsibility in the area of the public service in the interests of seeing to what extent we can solve the problems.  That is the sensible approach.In response to the Deputy's question on what was raised at a particular association's conference, the decentralisation implementation group has, as parts of its terms of reference, always been aware of the business issues surrounding the relocation programme.  With that in mind, each organisation participating in the programme was asked to prepare detailed implementation plans, including risk mitigation plans, etc.  Given the high levels of professionalism in the Civil Service, and its success in managing such projects — it has had over 25 years success managing such projects — I have every confidence the existing high standards of public services can be fully maintained in a decentralised environment.This is my position.  It is not based on some bald assertion or opinion but on experience.  I acknowledge that the problems in the State agency sector are more complex and that the sector does not have a history of decentralisation.  However, there has been a great indication of support for the process by staff.  Some 11,000 individual workers in the public service have applied to the Central Applications Facility declaring an interest.  This does not mean they have committed themselves fully to decentralisation, depending on how it works out, but there is significant interest.The number proposed in the programme was 10,000.  Therefore, the significant interest shown is an indication that the ambition of the programme was not misplaced in terms of the numbers interested in undertaking such a career move voluntarily depending on other factors being accommodated.  Let us be fair.  People are suggesting we forget about the programme because it has not happened overnight.  I do not believe the facts as they stand warrant that position, although I am sure there are problems.  They are there to be sorted out.  Management and unions sort out such matters all the time.  It is not for me to micromanage that situation.  The Deputy can raise specifics to me in regard to numbers, but those matters can be resolved.  It does not mean the whole programme is absurd.  That is my point.

It is not an issue of difference as to the value or import of what was proposed.  I recognise it was important and could contribute a valuable rejuvenation to several identified locations and that because of advancements in technology it should not render the work of these Departments and agencies lesser or make it more difficult.  However, clearly there are difficulties and these must be addressed.  In the absence of the roll-out of broadband, does the Taoiseach not agree that these matters must be addressed to overcome technological deficiencies in terms of the outworking of these new and particularly bilocated offices, as cited in the earlier instance?  The Taoiseach cited an overall figure in his reply on the numbers of those who expressed interest in taking up a decentralised post.  Does he have the number that specifically applies to those who are employed in the State agencies?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Some 1,000 people working in State agencies have applied to the Central Applications Facility.

Does he indicate an acceptance that, given the extent of the resistance, the strength of the opposition of SIPTU and other voices to the State agencies' relocation and the Labour Court decision, he believes it is the right time to sit down and address this substantively between the various partners, including the representatives of those involved in the trade union movement?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	42	That has always been my position.  As the Deputy knows, there was an IR problem in the FÁS test case that was taken and everybody stepped back to wait and see the outcome.  That is fair enough and I understand that.  The Labour Court suggested how we would proceed.  The Labour Court did not present a recommendation and tell us to go back to the status quo ante but provided a means by which we could proceed from there with that clarification, which was necessary and I will not have a quibble with it.  I respect the outcome of the Labour Court and its recommendation.  We must move on, but the problem is we are not moving on.  The best industrial practice is that we act on all aspects of a recommendation.  The recommendation covered specifics and the general approach that should be adopted to see how we can resolve the problem generally.

Anybody who thought the answers of the new Taoiseach would be more concise and shorter than those of his predecessor might also be under a misapprehension.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Let the Deputy ask me a short question and I will give a short answer.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Perhaps we can be objective for a moment.  I heard the Taoiseach say that the Opposition has been too negative and the process is taking a little more time than originally anticipated, but the scheme is good.  The most successful example of decentralisation is in Portlaoise in my and the Taoiseach's constituency.  The Taoiseach cited it here and in other places as the flagship of decentralisation.  I put it to the Taoiseach that there are, in fact, six buildings in Portlaoise incorporating sections of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and if one is speaking about efficiency, having people in six different locations in a small provincial town is not in the best interests of proper management.  When will a proper programme of building be undertaken for the staff who are scattered around the town in six locations?  I understand there will be eight locations before the end of the summer.  Is that proper management?  Is that proper consideration of efficiencies?  This is the flagship project.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I thank Deputy Flanagan for putting out item No. 1 on his A list to the Taoiseach for resolution of constituency problems.  On a serious note, I will have the matter examined and see whether there are plans to consolidate.  I cannot answer the Deputy at the moment but this is an issue in which we will have a joint interest and we will try to find a joint solution.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	48	That concludes Taoiseach's Questions.

Ebenezer B. Sekyi Hughes, Speaker of the Parliament of Ghana.  I express the hope that you will find your visit both worthwhile and entertaining.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The Government has been invited by the Olympic Council of Ireland to be represented at the Beijing Olympic Games but at this stage no decision has been taken on the question of Government representation.The European Parliament recently passed a resolution calling for a common EU position with regard to the attendance at the Olympic Games opening ceremony of the Heads of Government, Heads of State and the EU High Representative, with the option of non-attendance in the event that there is no resumption of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama.  EU Foreign Ministers have not supported calls for a boycott of either the games or the opening ceremony.The Government has welcomed the meeting on 4 May between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama in Shenzen.  We also welcome indications that a further meeting will now be held over the summer, and hope that these meetings can move quickly to remove any remaining impediments to more substantial talks which could address the issue of autonomy, within the framework of the Chinese constitution.The Olympic Games issue was discussed on 17 March at an informal meeting of EU Sports Ministers in Slovenia.  Ministers expressed their concerns at the political developments in Tibet and suggested that the 2008 Olympic Games might provide the ideal context for an improvement in the human rights landscape.  The Ministers took the view that major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, are an extremely efficient tool for strengthening intercultural dialogue while developing a culture of respect for human rights.  At the meeting, there was a consensus that there should be no support for calls for a boycott of the games.In Ireland, there is much public debate around attendance at the opening ceremony of the games.  I understand that the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland has been reported as saying that there is no question of the Irish team boycotting participation in the games.  Recently, the International Olympic Committee asked that there be no propaganda or demonstrations at Olympic venues, given the fact that 205 countries are represented, some of which are in conflict, and that the games are not the place to take political or religious stances.The Government has consistently made its views known on human rights issues in both Tibet and China and we feel it is important to continue to voice our concerns.  We should also be cognisant of our hard-working athletes, who only have the chance to compete in the Olympic Games once every four years.  The Government has been represented at the last six Olympic Games.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	51	First, I congratulate the Minister on his new post.  Whatever about attending the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, I am sure he might like to witness the return of the Liam McCarthy Cup to Waterford during the year.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	52	That would be a great pleasure.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	53	On a more serious note, the question I am raising is when the decision will be made and given the Minister's reply, it is obvious that will not happen for some time.As somebody involved in the sporting field, and having spoken to Mr. John Treacy and noted Mr. Pat Hickey being quoted, they do not want sport to be used in any way as a political vehicle in this sense.I suppose the best one could hope from ongoing negotiations would be that progress would be made.  If that progress is satisfactory — it would be good if the Minister could promote that within a European context — would he expect to attend the opening of the games?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.  He has summed up the position extremely well.  We are not isolated on this issue.  As he can see from the indications I have given in the reply, discussions are taking place within the EU as well, and that is good.  There have been some discussions among Foreign Ministers.There does not seem to be any mood to boycott the games in any way, and I would agree with that.  There are questions concerning movement forward in discussions between the Dalai Lama and Chinese authorities.  I indicated that a meeting took place on 4 May and the indications from that are there will be a further meeting, which we hope will bring movement on the issues of concern to all of us, on human rights and Tibet, within the framework of the Chinese constitution.At this stage we do not want to make any rash decisions.  As I stated, we have attended the previous six games and, I think, the opening ceremonies as well.  Obviously, it is a major event for our athletes and a huge event for the world.  Some 205 countries are participating and we would like to see a good outcome on all of the issues pertaining to participation at the games.As of now, I cannot indicate to the Deputy when a final decision might be taken as the situation is fluid and we are monitoring the discussions taking place.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	55	If progress is not made on these talks with the Chinese, has the Minister any idea what would be the implications for wider economic contacts with China?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I do not want to pre-empt what may come out of the talks.  As I stated, there has been a meeting and we welcome that.  The indications are that there will be one further meeting at least.  Obviously, our wish would be that at that meeting the outstanding matters could be resolved.  It is prudent to await the outcome of those talks before we make any further pronouncements on the issue.  Certainly, the Government's views on human rights issues have been made clear, both in Tibet and in China, and we would expect that those would be taken into consideration as well.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill will enable the Irish Sports Council to establish subsidiary companies such as the Irish Institute of Sport.  A number of policy issues have arisen during the course of the drafting of this legislation, which are under discussion between my Department, the Department of Finance, the Irish Sports Council and the Attorney General's office.  As soon as those discussions are completed, I intend to publish the Bill.I do not accept that the work of the Irish Institute of Sport is being hampered in any way while this legislation is being finalised.  The institute, which has its own executive chairman and board and which is funded by the Irish Sports Council, is continuing with its core purpose of creating an environment which influences and supports talented Irish athletes and ensures they will achieve sustained levels of excellence in elite sport.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and send good wishes to his predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan.I thank the Minister for his reply, but it does not get to the heart of what I am trying to establish here.  An institute of sport was first mooted by the then Minister, Deputy Jim McDaid, in December 2001 following the Sydney Olympic Games.  There was an Athens review in 2006, when the institute of sport, and its importance, was promoted.  We have been promised publication of the Bill for a long time.  Indeed, prior to the general election in 2007, if I remember rightly, we were assured the Bill would be published.  It seemed to disappear off the list for a while and now it is back again.  It would appear we will not get that Bill until the end of the year.In the meantime, there will be the Olympic Games.  The Minister has indicated that it has no impact on the promotion of sport.  We have seen the appointment of Seán Kelly and a number of other specialists in the area.  We are still leaving an air of uncertainty around it.  The future status of the Institute of Sport is not clear.  Will it be a subsidiary company of the Irish Sports Council?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	59	That is a fair question.  I am looking at the issue at the moment.  There are other issues that have been put on the table and that need to be resolved.  I do not necessarily take the view that the continued creation of new independent bodies is the way to go every time.  I am not referring specifically to this case, but I want the Deputy to realise that I intend to look at the issue.  I will bring it to a conclusion very quickly and I will not prevaricate on it.  The board is already set up with a chairman in place and it is doing its work without any hindrance.  It is under the auspices of the Irish Sports Council and we will see where we go from here.Our focus is now to support Irish athletes in every way we can during the run-in to the Olympic Games to make sure that they have the best opportunity to bring back medals to Ireland.  That is where we must focus our support, both financially and otherwise.  I intend to bring this matter to a conclusion fairly soon.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I am glad to hear that, but we have been talking about this since 2001.  I worry that we will spend another seven years talking about it.  It appears to me that the Minister will not have anything in place prior to the Olympic Games.  How will the funding be distributed to this new organisation?  Will it come via the Irish Sports Council, or will it come independently?  What exactly is the status — pension rights and so on — of the employees of the institute relative to those of the Irish Sports Council?  Unless the employees know where they stand, it will be very difficult for them to have a long-term commitment unless it is clarified.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I agree with the Deputy.  I have no intention of letting this issue hang around for seven years, or even seven months.  If we are to proceed with it, we must do so in a way that gives it the best opportunity to be successful in its remit.  It is currently under the remit of the Irish Sports Council and any funding is routed through that body.  I want to make a decision on the intention, the remit, the structure and the funding of the institute as soon as possible.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	62	When can we expect the Bill to be published?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Work on the Bill is ongoing and discussions between the Irish Sports Council, the Department of Finance and my Department are being finalised.  I will bring the issue to a conclusion fairly quickly.  If we are to proceed with this, we will publish a Bill, but if we do not proceed with it then we will not have a Bill.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Immigration policy is primarily a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Every sovereign state has a right and a responsibility to protect its borders and I do not believe that Ireland operates an aggressive immigration policy.  From a tourism perspective, we have been fortunate to enjoy record numbers of visitors to Ireland in recent years.  We welcomed over 8 million overseas visitors last year.  This performance clearly demonstrates that the vast majority of visitors to Ireland experience few difficulties getting here.I am not aware of immigration policy being a significant concern to the tourism industry.  However, I am aware of some recent incidents which have been highlighted by those involved in bringing students to Ireland to learn English as a foreign language.  This sector is an important niche tourism market and Ireland's tourist agencies have been actively involved in the marketing of Ireland as a location for English language learning.  In 2007,  some 140,000 students came to Ireland to learn English.  An Indecon economic report commissioned by Fáilte Ireland in 2007 estimated that the economic impact of the English language sector in Ireland could amount to around €500 million at 2006 prices.It is very important to protect this important market.  Accordingly, I am pleased that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is carrying out a general review of student immigration.  This review will draw up proposals for a more coherent approach to student migration consistent with Ireland's general immigration policy and with the Government's other policy objectives.  The review is scheduled for completion in the near future and its recommendations will be discussed with other relevant Departments, including the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.It is recognised that new and developing markets in the Asia-Pacific region represent significant opportunities for growth in tourist numbers in the medium to long term.  Tourism Ireland completed and published its review of new and developing markets in December last year.  The review sets out ambitious targets for both visitor numbers and revenue earnings over the period to 2013.Unlike our more established tourist markets, visitors from these markets require a visa before entering Ireland.  Tourism Ireland has specified that the need to ensure that visitors from these locations can secure the necessary visa in an efficient and cost-effective manner is of critical importance in maximising the opportunities from these markets.  My Department has received a discussion paper from Tourism Ireland on the issue and will be pursuing the matters raised in it with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I wish the Minister well in his new post and I hope we will work as productively and cordially as we did in the transport area.  I also thank him for his response.  I raised the issue because of the concern expressed following the reported treatment of a Brazilian education specialist who came here to a trade fair that was to showcase Ireland.  The person involved did not receive the céad míle fáilte we would like visitors to receive.This is more than a niche market.  It effectively constituted the tourism industry in Ireland in the 1980s, as virtually nothing else was happening back then.  It is not subject to changes in discretionary income, unlike other elements of the tourism industry.  It was there in the bad times and it will still be there if the bad times return.  It needs to be nurtured as part of our tourism industry, although it is educational as well.  It is a cross-cutting issue, but tourism will benefit most from it.An education Bill was promised to regulate the schools that receive these students, but it never came to fruition.  Some of the companies have a very bad name and are bringing in Chinese students but do not require them to attend classes, as they provide cheap labour around the country.  If we are to maintain that tourist product, it must be reliable.  It falls to the Minister to make sure that it is regarded as an important tourism product and he should talk to the Minister for Education and Science about it.  The representational body of the international schools does not have any representation on the regional tourist boards, but the Minister could request Bord Fáilte to ensure that it does so because it is such an important part of the tourist industry.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I did not use the word "niche" to suggest the market is small or insignificant, but rather to suggest it is a specific part of the market.  I would not consider the €500 million contribution per annum to the economy as insignificant either.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is carrying out a review of student immigration at the moment.  We will be involved in the finalisation of that review.  The recent report identified new and developing markets and we all agree that the Asia-Pacific region offers significant potential.  From my time at the Department of Transport, I know the runway at Dublin Airport was lengthened to accommodate direct flights from the Far East.  This has much potential for the future as people will not have to stop off in the UK before getting here.  These developments augur well for growth in numbers from developing markets.It is important we have a clear policy in place.  There must be balance between ensuring we have a proper immigration policy and good controls in place, while ensuring the céad míle fáilte to those who come here is an obvious one.A figure double our population, namely some 8 million people, came into the country last year.  That this was successful demonstrates that, in large measure, our policy is working quite well.  This does not mean we cannot enhance the procedures in place to protect existing markets and grow new markets.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Following the announcement of the Government's decentralisation programme in the 2004 budget, the Department, which has a staff of 130, excluding the National Archives, was designated an early mover by the decentralisation implementation group.  Of the nine principal officers who were in the Department prior to the announcement of the programme of decentralisation, only one applied to transfer to Killarney.  That officer subsequently decided against relocating.  However, four principal officers from other Departments and offices applied on the Central Applications Facility to decentralise to Killarney and they transferred to the Department on a planned, phased basis.  Three of the remaining principal officers posts have been filled through promotion competitions and there are panels in place from which the remaining two posts will ultimately be filled.Overall, only ten of the existing staff of the Department opted to transfer to Killarney and it was clear that the impact of the implementation of decentralisation could be significant if not managed properly.  Against this background the Department set itself a key corporate goal in its 2005-07 statement of strategy to manage the organisational challenge while continuing to deliver quality customer service during the implementation of the decentralisation programme.To underpin the delivery of this goal a decentralisation implementation plan was prepared and is kept under constant review.  The Department's human resource strategy and its partnership structures were revised to take account of the implications of decentralisation.  A decentralisation committee, comprised of management and staff, has been established to support and to help address the operational challenges involved.  Furthermore, in order to meet the needs of new staff transferring into the Department a comprehensive training plan was put in place, which is regularly reviewed and revised.  Procedures manuals have also been prepared in the financial area and in the case of the Department's major capital programmes.To specifically address the potential loss of corporate memory, the transfer of staff into the Department who applied to relocate to Killarney was planned carefully and carried out on a phased basis using some overlaps in the case of critical areas.  At this stage a total of 84 staff are in place, 70 of whom are already based in temporary premises in Fossa.  It is expected that the new permanent headquarters for the Department will be ready for occupation in the last quarter of 2008.  The intake of the remaining staff is scheduled to take place between now and the first quarter of 2009 when the Department will be fully decentralised.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Did I hear the Minister correctly when he said that none of the nine principal officers in his Department who have experience will be moving to Killarney?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Yes.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	How many assistant secretaries will be moving?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I do not have that detail but I will get the information for the Deputy.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	72	From questions to the previous Minister I understand eight members of staff with experience in the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism are moving.  Some five members have moved and three still have to move.  Does the Minister understand the concern that exists in all sectors of the Department with the loss of expertise, corporate memory and continuity and the lack of any coherence?  I understand this is an early mover and the move is happening but there is no transfer of experience.  The previous Minister was Dublin based but how does Deputy Cullen propose to operate a Department as diverse as it is from Waterford?  In his first week, the Minister has learned that the Department consists almost entirely of agencies, most of which are based in Dublin, such as the Sports Council and the cultural institutions on both sides of Leinster House.  How does the Minister envisage this operating?  They cannot move so would the Minister reconsider total decentralisation?I was surprised to hear only €645,000 has already been spent, which I thought was great value, until I discovered this figure excluded property.  I do not know what €645,000 was spent on so far.  It might be feasible to decentralise one element of sports, arts or tourism but trying to decentralise all three elements when all the bodies are based in Dublin and the Minister is based in Waterford, with no principal officers leaving and I suspect only one assistant secretary and seven other members of staff, would seem to lead to absolute chaos.  No policy unit is decentralising.  Where is this Department going?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I accept that there is a challenge but I have discussed this with the Secretary General and my experience in my first few days is that there has been a co-ordinated and planned approach to this.  The assistant principals and principal officers to whom I referred earlier gained experience they would not otherwise have.  They are not just coming in overnight and transferring to Killarney.  Some 70 members of staff have transferred to Killarney and we will not row back on that.  There are logistics issues for some operational matters.  I have no problem going to Killarney, it is a nice part of the country with which I am familiar.In terms of communications in the modern world we live in, many of what are perceived as traditional problems can be easily resolved.  There will be times when face to face meetings must be organised but, from the discussions I have had in the Department, I am generally satisfied there is a positive view and that the 70 members of staff are positive about their remit.  We must learn new skills and some of us must learn them quickly but it is not beyond the ability of senior civil servants to pick up on new skills very quickly.  Some have been in the Department for nearly three years and in that time they have acquired the knowledge needed in the Department.  There is not a major issue in that regard.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	74	From my brief discussions with people in the Department I do not think there is a positive approach to moving to Killarney.  It is not just a question of the Minister going to Killarney.  The reality is that the steering groups——
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Deputy asked about me so I answered her.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Minister is certainly an important part of it.  The National Gallery, the National Library and the museums in Dublin will be completely disconnected from what is happening in Killarney.  The real worry is the absence of any policy continuity.  When the Department decentralises, we will have nine people with experience in arts, sports and tourism.  That is a frightening thought for all Departments because I suspect it is no different in other Departments.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	It should be remembered that long before this programme was put in place, civil servants have moved regularly between Departments as part of promotion systems.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	78	They do not have turnover of 95%.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	It was not at the level of the decentralisation programme.  Given the length of time some of these people have spent in the Department - three years in some cases - I do not think the Deputy is suggesting there is a lack of knowledge or experience of the Department.  I have been in the Department only a few days and must get to know it and understand the issues in a short time.  That is a challenge but I have confidence that the staff who opted to go to Killarney and to other Departments elsewhere are more than capable of making the transition.  It is not without its challenges but in the long term it will be very good for the Civil Service and for the country, particularly the locations of new Departments.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The National Development Plan 2007-2013, which was published in January 2007 contains the largest ever Government investment programme for the development of the arts and culture, tourism and sport sectors.  The NDP includes an €800 million tourism development programme, a €904 million cultural sub-programme and a €991 million sport sub-programme.These programmes contain a wide range of capital schemes and projects which will be progressively rolled out over the lifetime of the plan.  The Department of Finance is preparing the first comprehensive report on NDP implementation in 2007 which, following consideration by the NDP central monitoring committee and the Government, will be published in due course.As regards tourism, the international marketing sub-programme is on track, with €45 million expended in 2007 and a budget of €50 million provided this year.  Construction work on the convention centre in Dublin commenced in 2007 and the massive steel works for the spectacular new building at Spencer Dock are well advanced.  During 2007, the first of three funds under the tourism product development sub-programme was launched.  At the end of 2007, some €8 million of tourism infrastructure works were reported by Failte Ireland as being completed.  In addition, some €20 million of expenditure was provided under the training and human resources sub-programme.On the sports side, construction of the new Lansdowne Road stadium is now well under way and it is planned that the 50,000 seater stadium will open during 2010.  Following the recent appointment of project management and design teams, detailed work on the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown is proceeding.  Applications for funding under the 2008 sports capital programme were invited in January last and more than 1,450 applications received are currently being assessed.  The local authority swimming pool programme is also progressing with an investment of almost €28 million made in 2007.In the arts and culture sector, a new National Concert Hall will be developed on the existing site at Earlsfort Terrace.  It is planned to initiate the PPP procurement competition very shortly with a view to contracts being signed in 2009.  The redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George's Dock is also progressing well with the appointment of a jury for the design competition and of technical and financial advisers.  The Wexford Festival Opera House is on schedule for completion in 2008 while the Gaiety Theatre project has been successfully completed.  Progress is being made on the extensions to all of the main national cultural institutions.Finally, €7.3 million has been drawn down since 1 January 2007 to date by projects under the ACCESS programme, leaving a balance of €73.7 million during the course of the NDP.  The Government is committed to implementing the NDP and I look forward to advancing the full range of projects envisaged during my tenure as Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I have been perusing the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and programme for Government 2002.  Many of these projects date from way back and many have not yet commenced.  However, I want to concentrate on three particular projects.Before coming to those projects I would like to point out that I recently visited the Wexford Festival Opera House and it is a fantastic building, as I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware.  I understand the Minister will have the pleasure of opening it.  It is a spectacular building, one of which we can all be proud.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Yes, indeed.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I want now to speak about three particular institutions desperately in need of investment.  I accept this is not the fault of the current Minister as this is his first week in the job.  However, it is a matter to which he will have to pay attention.  The three institutions are the National Archives, the National Library and the National Museum.  The lack of investment in these institutions is simply unforgivable.  All of them have been promised funding.  As all three institutions are on the receiving end of a conveyor belt of artefacts and written material, their main problem is lack of storage space.  The Minister will be aware that the National Archives is responsible for conserving and making accessible every public document.  However, it simply cannot do this within the existing premises which is basically a biscuit factory.I recently visited the National Library.  While I had heard about the manner in which books are being stored, I was shocked to see it.  It is a tinderbox.  We will lose 700 years of written and photographic material with one spark in that building.  The National Library must receive funding immediately.  The Minister will be aware that it must take in every book printed, yet it does not have the storage capacity to do this.The Comptroller and Auditor General's recently published report on the National Museum made frightening reading.  The problem at the museum has worsened due to the unearthing by the National Roads Authority of many artefacts.  There is nowhere for these artefacts to be stored. Some of them are being stored outdoors.  Work on rebuilding the fallen staircase and other refurbishment works cannot commence as there are no staff available to conserve the artefacts and ensure they are moved to safe locations.  Something has to be done in terms of storage in these buildings, if nothing else.  The issue of shared storage was referred to in the national development plan.  One, or all three, projects must be brought forward.  I understand work in this regard falls to the Office of Public Works which has many people calling on its services.  It is up to the Minister to drive the projects forward.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am familiar, having spent time in the Office of Public Works, with the institutions referred to by Deputy Mitchell.  I have seen at first hand the fantastic work done by the Office of Public Works not alone in Dublin, but around the country.I agree with the Deputy in respect of the proper care and storage of national archives be they pertaining to the National Archives, National Museum or National Library.  I will try to drive forward a solution.  I am not sure this afternoon whether there exists the possibility of a collective solution, but  Deputy Mitchell can rest assured I will deal with the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I understand that Horse Racing Ireland is currently completing its strategic plan for 2008-12 and I look forward to receiving it in due course.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I thank the Minister for his brief reply.I raised this issue owing to my ongoing concern at the proportion of the sports budget allocated to Horse Racing Ireland which is more than that allocated to all other sports combined.  That is not to suggest Horse Racing Ireland does not need or deserve that funding.  The sporting and tourism aspects of the industry make it worth supporting.  However, it should be able to support itself.  The Minister will have to make a decision on the issue soon as the fund expires this year and legislation will be required to put in place continued support for the industry.The former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, reduced the tax on off-course betting which in turn funded the sport.  He continued to reduce that tax on the basis that the industry needed this help to compete with the on-line bettering sector.  The reality is that Paddy Power and others are making huge profits.  This would indicate that Charlie McCreevy moved far too soon on this and that huge profits are being made in this area.  I read recently that Horse Racing Ireland's dividend to shareholders increased sevenfold last year.The industry relies heavily on horse racing and the State should be able to capture some of this money.  I ask that the Minister agree as quickly as possible with Horse Racing Ireland how the industry is to be funded.  Clearly, sport is suffering as a result.  I learned through a freedom of information request that the previous Minister believed at least €5 million was needed to support the Olympics, yet not one single penny was allocated this year to the Olympic team.  This matter also requires urgent attention.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	87	While my reply was brief, I was simply providing the Deputy with a straight answer to her question.  I look forward to receiving the strategic plan soon.I take the view that horse racing and the horse industry, in its broadest sense, is of enormous importance to this country.  While race meetings may be the shop window of an important industry, there is much more to the industry than that.  I am not known as a Minister who regularly attends horse racing meetings.  However, that is not to suggest that I do not understand or am not hugely committed to fostering and ensuring the standing worldwide of our horse racing industry in all its guises remains in tact and can be and is strengthened as we go forward.As the Deputy correctly stated, key strategic decisions need to be taken, some of which are up for consideration this year.  I will certainly turn my mind to this.  I hope the strategic plan being prepared by Horse Racing Ireland will help me and all those concerned with the industry to make the right decisions to enhance it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	88	A London 2012 task force was established in August 2006 to ensure Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities arising from our proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012.  This task force included experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and was supported by staff within my Department.The selection of London as the host city for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games offers opportunities which could be availed of by Ireland in the areas of tourism, business, sport and culture.  The task force's focus has been on assessing the quality and suitability of Ireland's sporting and ancillary infrastructure in terms of its appeal to countries and athletes preparing to take part in the London Olympics and Paralympics; completing an economic evaluation of the potential impacts in the sectors of tourism, business and sport arising from Ireland's proximity to the 2012 games; and identifying other beneficial spin-offs from the Olympics and Paralympics.The task force has submitted its report and I will consider its findings and recommendations.  As of yet, I have not read the report.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I understood the previous Minister received it but was not happy with it and asked the Department to re-examine it.  A facilities audit was carried out.  Has information been passed to the organisers of the London Olympics to make them aware of what is available in Ireland?  Has a response been received in this regard?  It was also suggested that if we did not have the training facilities for teams or were unable to host any of the events that we might be in a position to host some of the qualifying tournaments and events.  Has progress been made in this regard?  If it were possible, they would need to be in the pipeline.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I agree.  It is the view that the fact that the Olympics will be held in London in 2012 will provide opportunities in a range of areas such as tourism and directly with athletes in terms of facilities.  There are also business opportunities.  As I stated, the report is in but I have not read it and I do not want to guess at it.  An issue that arose was the quality of some of the physical infrastructural facilities available to athletes.  They were not up to a standard required to attract countries and their athletes to come here prior to the 2012 Olympics.  This is a key issue that must be examined.  It is a priority because four years is not that far away.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Is there a possibility of fast-tracking some of the developments in train, such as in Abbottstown?  A 200 m track has been proposed.  Why do we not go for a long-term strategy and seek a 400 m track and encourage top-class athletes to avail of such a facility?  I am interested in fast-tracking the filling of gaps which will be identified and highlighted in the national audit.  As the Minister stated, this will provide major economic and sporting opportunities for the country.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Whatever facilities are resourced, I would like to put enough in to maximise the usage of these facilities.  If there is an enormous difference between putting resources into a particular sized facility as opposed to a larger facility and one can see the return on it, it is worth considering.  I am anxious to be directly involved in the development of Abbottstown and to make decisions on it as soon as we can.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I have a similar question as I also thought of Abbottstown.  Apart from the aquatic centre, a 25,000 seater stadium was promised for field sports and athletics.  Is there any prospect that this will be completed by 2012?  Is it a facility we could offer to the London organisers?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Abbottstown has many positive aspects.  I would like to bring clarity to what we will do with regard to the development of a sports campus at Abbottstown.  I have been a strong supporter from the beginning and I will engage soon with the various stakeholders involved to see what is the best way forward to give the best return to our athletes and sport in general.  If doing this attracts other countries to use our facilities, it is all to the good.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 103 and 112 together.I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 78 earlier today which dealt with this subject.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I am happy to accept that answer.  There is nothing further to be said until we know for sure what is happening.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	97	It is important that whatever happens sporting interests are protected.  We should have no intervention that would hamper our athlete's opportunities for success.  Has the Minister met Mr. Pat Hickey of the IOC?  Perhaps he has not had an opportunity to do so since taking up his new portfolio.  It would be important to speak to him and representatives of the athletes.I accept the Minister's answer to the previous question with regard to attendance at the opening ceremony.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Meetings are being organised with representatives of the Irish Olympic Council and all the sporting bodies.  I want to do this as quickly as possible because urgent matters are raised with regard to the Olympic Games which are about to take place.  I understand a meeting between Mr. Hickey and me has been arranged.  I believe he is away at present.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I agree with Deputy Upton that whatever we do, we should not in any way interfere with the sporting element.  Governments have many opportunities to make political points.  Most athletes only get one chance at the Olympic Games as they take place only every four years.  I do not believe there is a suggestion that we will interfere with them but I wish to state that I am against it.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	100	We are all in agreement on that.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I have not received the mid-term review of Partnership for the Arts as it has not yet been completed.  The formal mid-term review of the strategy has been under way since January 2008.  It is centred on Partnership for the Arts: In Practice 2006 — 2008, the strategy document guiding current Arts Council policy and provision.  The outcomes of the mid-term review will be considered by the Arts Council in June and will inform policy and provision for the second period of the strategy from 2009 to 2010.  Once the review has been completed the Arts Council will formally submit it to the Department and I look forward to receiving it and discussing it with the Arts Council.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I am a little confused and possibly people in the arts are also confused because many plans are produced.  Partnership for the Arts was the second plan of the Arts Council — the first plan it tried to produce was rejected by a former Minister.  Partnership for the Arts was accepted and this year the previous Minister produced an arts and culture plan for 2008.  He also introduced an arts and culture business plan for 2008.What aspects of the Partnership for the Arts plan were not acceptable to the Minister?  What changes is he trying to bring about in terms of policy?  There must be some confusion about the mixed messages coming from the Department among those funded by the Arts Council.  The touring experiment was lauded in the business plan and the previous Minister stated he was supportive of it.  However, it received no funding beyond the initial commitment.  It was quite clear that if it was to continue, a serious increase in funding would be necessary.  Has the Minister formed a view about which plan will be implemented?  Is there a meeting of minds between him and the Arts Council?

As the Deputy will appreciate, I am anxious to do what I outlined regarding those meetings as quickly as possible.  She is correct about the number of plans.  I want to get my head around whether I am supposed to deal with one plan or an amalgam.  My approach will be to select a plan and deliver it as I do not want more plans.  The review has been under way since January and the Arts Council will have it completed next month.  Once that is done, it will be time to agree with the council and those generally involved what we will do and to agree a specific strategy.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I refer to the touring experiment, which was a point of contention.  It requires funding and I hope, given that the Minister is not from Dublin, he will realise the necessity to fund this experiment in order that maximum usage of the many new facilities provided around the country will be achieved.  Many are lying idle and cannot put on the performances that could be made available through additional investment.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I have no hesitation in agreeing with the Deputy.  I fully agree touring the arts is absolutely crucial.  Many different elements could be toured that otherwise would not be.  I have a strong view about the value of the arts in general.  It is of huge value to all generations, particularly our youth.  It is not exclusive to the large cities, particularly Dublin, even though many of the major facilities are located here.  That does not take away from the fact that everybody should be involved throughout the country.  The Deputy is correct that we have invested in new facilities and we have restored and renovated facilities.  I would like to maximise their usage and I will seek to put resources into them — the Deputy mentioned touring — to make sure we achieve that value.

Will he make a statement on the matter?; (8) Deputy Seymour Crawford — the need to address the situation in Monaghan General Hospital; and (9) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — the need to address the crisis in child protection.The matters raised by Deputies Barrett, Crawford, Ó Caoláin and Doyle have been selected for discussion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Last night's "Prime Time Investigates" programme showed up another appalling scandal in Irish society similar to the Leas Cross programme.  This time it dealt with our young rather than the elderly.  The programme clearly showed that services for children at serious risk are hopelessly inadequate and they are not being delivered.  It also showed clearly that some children will die and others will suffer long-term damage unless decisive and effective action is taken.  I accuse the Minister for Health and Children, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children of hiding behind the mantra, the construction of words, "services are being delivered to children who are at immediate and serious risk".  The phrase "immediate and serious risk" is repeated over and over again as an incidence of competence when clearly the issue is that children at risk are not receiving any services.  Given that 258 people are lying on trolleys around the country, 3,598 children are waiting for psychological assessments and 40,000 people are waiting for operations, how many children at risk are on waiting lists where no intervention has taken place and where clearly the consequences pointed out in last night's programme beckon for their future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I did not have the opportunity to view the programme last night but I understand its contents.  The newly appointed Minister for State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, will take this matter up with the HSE tomorrow to see where the situation is from his point of view.  It is an issue to which he attaches a high priority.A great deal of progress has been made in this area.  As I understand it, where a report of a child at risk is made, it is assessed by the general pool of social workers within the health service and a person is allocated to the case if the risk is such that that is what is deemed to be required.  A spectrum must be addressed.  Increased resources are going into this area.  The HSE is in the process of seeking to employ a further 50 staff in this area.  Staff turnover has been high but the right way to proceed is through the Office of the Minister for Children to pull together all the issues and policy areas in the one office.  This is regarded by many as succeeding and progressing well.  In the past, the problem was services were provided in isolation from families and family supports.  The emphasis has been placed not only on the interaction between the social worker and the child but also on working with extended family members to ensure children at risk are not dealt with in isolation from the environment in which they were reared.  That community-based activity is regarded as a more progressive and effective way of dealing with this issue than was the case in the past.  I understand the Ombudsman for Children was interviewed for the programme but I do not know whether that formed part of it.  My understanding is that this was a reference to a progression being made in this area.  Not all problems are solved.  Progress is being made and the Minister of State is taking this matter up with the HSE as his first priority on taking office.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The Taoiseach has come in here with an extraordinarily high reputation for straight talk and delivery.  He mentioned outcomes and delivery as being fundamental to what he must do.  On 29 April 2008, Deputy Shatter asked the Minister of State with responsibility for children how many at risk children were on waiting lists where no intervention has taken place.  The Minister of State at the time was unable to answer that question.  He has now been promoted for his lack of knowledge about a fundamental issue with which he was dealing.  He did not know the answer to the question.The reason he did not know the answer is because the HSE or the Minister for Health and Children are also unable to answer the question for the simple reason that they are dealing with 2006 figures.  Deputy Shatter pointed that out on 29 April and there was no answer.  Since then, we have had a consistent hiding behind the words "serious and immediate risk" when we know that there are hundreds of children who are at risk but who do not receive services simply because they do not fall into the category where one can tick the two boxes of "immediate" and "serious".The Taoiseach has, quite rightly, spoken very strongly about those marginalised at the edge of society, bringing the vulnerable to the centre of State services and lifting people up.  I agree with those sentiments but is he not ashamed of a situation where, as the paymaster for the past number of years, he now assumes the reins of responsibility in the full knowledge that the Minister who took over from him does not know the number of children at risk on waiting lists where no intervention has taken place?  It is a fact that the Government is now colluding with the HSE in the endangerment of the children of the nation and playing games with words.The Taoiseach mentioned that he understood what was in the programme.  I know he does.  I will give three examples.  There was a referral from a teacher in 2006 regarding an eight year old girl who disclosed that her uncle kept trying to kiss her on the lips and that her stepfather kept showing her pictures of naked women.  To date, she has never been met by social workers and her file remains open.  What about the child aged four whose mother had seriously self-harmed by ingesting glass and cutting herself?  The mother had disclosed that she was suicidal and that her boyfriend was very violent.  She failed to show up for an appointment and no further contact could be made with this family.  The case was closed last December.  What about the 12 year old boy who was displaying extremely sexually abusive behaviour towards other children?  He was referred in early 2006 and it was almost two years before his parents were met by social workers.  However, they could offer him no response and no service.Who made these decisions?  If we are serious about protecting the children of the nation, not playing games with words and hiding behind the Minister for Health and Children's mantra of serious and immediate risk, surely we should be in a position to provide a service at weekends and out of hours.  Most of these incidents take place out of hours and at weekends when social workers cannot be contacted and when there are no services.I do not want to hear the Taoiseach respond to this in words that amount to another covert cutback in health services here.  Does he know how many children are on waiting lists where no intervention has taken place?  Will he give a guarantee that the State and the Government under his direction will see to it and give a guarantee that there will be an out of hours and weekend service for those who are most vulnerable and at risk and who, as "Prime Time Investigates" pointed out, will die in some cases and suffer long-term damage in others?  This is the Taoiseach's responsibility now.  He has talked it up on one side; I would like to see delivery on the other.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	117	When the Deputy is Taoiseach, he can ask the questions.  A total of 4,710 children are in foster care placements.  We have seen a significant expansion of foster care placements in recent years.Clearly, it is not simply a question of every case being referred to an individual social worker.  One needs community-based family support services as a more effective means of dealing with these issues because these children are in this situation on an ongoing basis.  An extra 333 social workers have been appointed since 2003, while 718 social workers are specifically working in this area for the 20,000 referrals coming through.  These are the issues and this is the rate of resource being applied.  A total of €1 million per day is applied to this area, quite apart from the salary costs of those excellent people who provide that service, so it is not a question of the Government being indifferent to the situation.The Government has been pulling together all the service provision so that we get a more effective and efficient way of dealing with this problem.  That is the issue.  A significant amount of resources is being applied.  I understand that the Ombudsman for Children has indicated that progress is being made in these areas.  There are still specific problems which the Minister of State is taking up with the HSE as a matter of priority.  He is taking up the issue of the out of hours service with the HSE tomorrow.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The programme last night was shocking.  One of the most shocking things about it was that it was not the first time we have heard about this problem.  A review of the HSE's child services published in the newspapers on 21 April 2008 reported exactly the same thing.  It told us that there was a waiting list of 374 social work cases in the north Dublin area that had not been properly assessed.  It said that in central Dublin, some children are waiting up to a year to be allocated a social worker.  It said that at risk children were waiting for three and a half years in County Kerry for services such as psychiatric support.  It went on to give the litany of the degree to which this service is not functioning.The Taoiseach says that progress is being made.  It is very difficult to square that with what people on the ground are saying.  A couple of weeks ago, the Garda Representative Association told us that it is virtually impossible to get a social worker out of hours.  The same can be said by doctors, teachers and people who are at the frontline coming into contact with and identifying these problems for referral in the first place.We need to hear what is to be done about the problems highlighted in the programme last night and that have already been reported by the HSE.  First, what will be done to provide an adequate out of hours service?  Social work is not a Monday to Friday, nine to five service.  In particular, it needs to be available out of hours when many of the problems arise in the first place.  What will be done to provide an out of hours service?Second, as I understand it, the embargo on the recruitment of staff, which is at the heart of much of this problem, is operating on a region to region basis.  The HSE is supposed to be a national organisation but, in practice, the same embargo operates in a region with almost a full complement of social workers as in a region which has only half a complement.  What will be done to deal with that aspect?The Taoiseach identified that there are referrals and urgent referrals.  The content of the television programme was that the top priority cases are not being seen.  They are still in the filing cabinet drawers because the staff or resources are not available to see them.The Taoiseach made an oblique reference to the possibility of other types of interventions or supports being provided to children at risk but what does he say to a teacher, doctor or member of the Garda Síochána who comes across a case about which he or she is concerned but who knows now that if it is referred on to the social services, through the HSE, the case might be waiting for a very long time before anybody takes a look at it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I agree that we must deal with this important issue.  There are 718 social workers dedicated to this area and 20,000 referrals per year, which amounts to 30 referrals per case worker, on average.  I know that the same case levels do not apply everywhere but the figures give an indication that the level of resources are such that we should not be ending up with the types of cases the Deputy raised.One of the problems is the need to reach agreement with the professional care services to put an out-of-hours service in place.  That is part of the ongoing problem here.  I am not in any way seeking to hide behind statistics.  I am simply making the point that if we have 718 social workers dedicated in this area, with 20,000 referrals per year, one would not expect to see the delays the Deputy is suggesting exist in respect of serious cases.  Deputy Gilmore has acknowledged that there is a general pool assessment which must take place first, which dictates what cases need immediate care and attention because they are serious and the persons involved are at risk.There are other risk issues which are not quite so serious that must be dealt with in the context of the extended family environment in which the child lives.  In the past, that was not the case.  It has been suggested that best practice is to continue along the current path of delivering a community-based service, through family support mechanisms rather than just dealing with the individual child in respect of the particular issue that arose.  That is deemed to be the best way of not only dealing with the specific problem but also of meeting the needs of the child on an ongoing basis.  That is what the Office of the Minister for Children is doing.  There is a general recognition that the Office of the Minister for Children has been one of the cross-cutting areas that has worked better than most in terms of how the Government is addressing this issue now.  In the past it was dealt with disparately by the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science.While I do not deny that the problems outlined exist, I am simply making the point that it is not a question of old ways being tried here which are failing.  There are new, progressive, best practice methods being implemented, through the joined-up process to which I referred.  I have spoken about the extra staff who have been put in place in recent years.  I have also spoken about the case load, which would suggest to me that we should not be experiencing the level of problems highlighted.The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, is taking up this matter tomorrow.  He will determine why some situations are arising, like those referred to by Deputy Gilmore, in view of the level resources being applied and the number of personnel available to deal with the issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Many people listening to Deputy Barry Andrews this morning would have had a lot of sympathy for the position in which he found himself, as a new Minister of State, having to trot out the same old excuses.  The issue which must be addressed is why he was in that situation and why the same old excuses had to be trotted out.Let us have some plain speaking on this matter.  When the Taoiseach says that there are 20,000 referrals a year and more than 700 social workers, is he telling this House that the social workers are swinging the lead?  Is that what he is saying?  What does he mean?We now have a number of reports which tell us that there are serious delays in cases being dealt with and children are being put at risk.  Not so long ago, there was a case involving a mother and her two children who died in County Wexford and one of the stories attached to that tragedy was that an out-of-hours service was not available.  The people who are working on the front line, including gardaí, teachers, and doctors, and coming across at-risk children and difficulties in families need to know what to do.  Following last night's television programme and the reports we have seen, we now have a picture of a service that is not delivering.  A referral can be made and even if it is a priority referral, it still may not be dealt with.  The Taoiseach is implying that the problem is the social workers.  He should clarify his comments and tell us what steps will be taken by the Office of the Minister for Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews and the Government to ensure that an adequate service is made available so that we are not back here, at some stage, discussing a catastrophe involving a child or group of children.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I am not suggesting anything but simply stating the facts regarding the level of activity and resources being applied.  We would all expect that such resources would not lead to the difficulties referred to today.  The Minister of State will be investigating the matter in detail with the staff.I am not passing judgment on anybody.  I am simply saying that if the level of resources referred to were not available and people were expected to take on caseloads ten times the current average size, then I would understand the delays and accept that the service is under-resourced.  With regard to the flexibility required for an out-of-hours service, the Government would welcome an agreement on that issue.  The problem is that we have not reached agreement yet.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	124	If we put in more resources, based on the existing arrangements, then we will still have the nine to five service about which Deputies are complaining, and no out-of-hours service.  We must reach agreement in order to make such a flexible service available.In addition to the existing resource allocation, a further 50 social workers are being recruited at present, which will bring the numbers employed up to 768.  We obviously need to agree arrangements to make an out-of-hours service available and do so within the current resource allocation.  That should be possible.I am simply making the point that the levels of activity suggest to me that a greater degree of flexibility and availability might be possible, in view of the resources available.  We are investing €365 million per year, which equates to €1 million a day.  That is not insignificant.  That is quite apart from, quite rightly, paying the salaries of the people who are working in the area, who number 718.We must allow the Minister of State to engage on that issue and come up with solutions to the types of situations raised by the Deputy.  I do not see why that should be the case, given the level of resources being applied.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	132	This January saw the second anniversary of the document, A Vision for Change, which was to be the charter for mental health services.  No money was allocated for this programme in 2008.  When will the mental health (amendment) Bill, which is No. 56 on the legislative programme, be brought before the House?  Its publication is expected in 2009.  If the implementation of the document A Vision for Change is not being resourced, we will face serious problems.I am pleased the Taoiseach launched a broadside yesterday regarding the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  I am glad he is urging all his members to stay inside the tent first of all and then to go out and campaign strongly for a "Yes" vote.  In that context, is it proposed to have a discussion in the House to allow for an outline of the full range of what is on offer in terms of the trade agreement at the World Trade Organisation talks?  I understand this is available in the Department.  There is serious angst within the agri-sector in respect of the Government's right to use a veto at the conclusion of the World Trade Organisation talks if they are concluded, notwithstanding any intervention from the United States.  I ask for the Taoiseach's comments because it is an issue out there on the hustings as he will become aware shortly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I understand the mental health (amendment) Bill is not due until next year.  With regard to the other matter, it is important to point out that we recently had a serious discussion in the House.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food offered a briefing to bring people up to speed on the situation.  Unfortunately, this invitation has not yet been taken up, as far as I am aware, and it is something that could be considered.  We must avoid ending up in a situation where we discuss issues such as the WTO which may or may not conclude at all, and may only have a 50-50 chance of concluding, whereas we are definitely dealing with another issue on 12 June and it is vital to achieve a "Yes"  vote for that issue.In the context of the health check which will take place on the Common Agricultural Policy this year, it is very important that our Minister would be armed with a considerable mandate in favour of Europe when trying to deal with simplification of the single farm payment.  This issue is on that agenda and is one we would like to pursue with colleagues.  It is an issue which has been raised by farmers and we would like to address it in the context of the health check.  The possibility of increased milk quota is another issue we want to address.The tendency to suggest that one would be looking after farming and agrifood interests by voting "No" in the European Union referendum on the basis of concerns which might never emerge in the WTO talks would be shooting ourselves in the foot twice because we then would have a situation where the Minister would be asked to go in to those discussions on the health check without the goodwill from colleagues we would otherwise have as a result of a strong "Yes" vote.  While I understand the concerns and issues being raised are a matter of public debate, I ask that we keep these issues separate so that we do not confuse the public, let alone ourselves.While these issues are to do with the same sectors in terms of the stages of the negotiations, by giving a "Yes" vote to the European reform treaty we have a fundamental interest to protect in terms of how the Common Agricultural policy health check goes in the short term and indeed many of the other issues post-2013 which are also germane.  We need the goodwill of colleagues to deal with these matters as these Common Agricultural Policy reforms are being considered.  I ask that we keep those matters separate.  It might be a good idea to take up the invitation to the briefing on the WTO issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I am at one with the Taoiseach on this matter.  I have been expressing this point of view clearly and cogently for the past number of months.  However, the Government should now intercede with the farming organisations which clearly by advertisement link the Lisbon treaty to the WTO.  I have made my view clear that they are separate matters but they are being linked and many of those involved in the agri-sector may well take that to heart.  I suggest the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should liaise directly in order to clarify the situation because it is so important for the future of everybody that we be part of a stronger Europe and then be in a stronger position to deal with the consequences of WTO whenever it is concluded.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	135	On first day in the job I was in Northern Ireland and I was here on my second day.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, met with Michel Barnier, the French Agriculture Minister.  He came to see me in my office and we discussed the issue for 15 minutes although not in great detail as he had to catch a plane.  I knew Mr. Barnier when he was in the Commission and I was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I know the French Government is working with us on this matter.  It is very important that we do not end up in a situation where we apply a position to the treaty on the basis of a concern about the WTO which may not happen at all.  This makes no sense, although this is not to say we are not concerned about the issues.  However, we should not decide to shoot ourselves in the foot twice.

The OECD report, published last week, drew attention to the increase in the number of State agencies.  In response, the Taoiseach indicated his wish to see some State agencies merged, amalgamated or whatever.  The legislative programme proposes the creation of 11 further State agencies.  Does the Taoiseach intend to indicate to the House his plans with regard to the amalgamation or abolition of some State agencies?On the publication of the Green Paper on local government, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised legislation to limit the spending by candidates in the forthcoming local elections.  When will that legislation be introduced?I note my constituency colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, last year published a Private Members' Bill, the Spent Convictions Bill 2007.  Will that Bill be presented as a Government Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	139	We intend to take the Spent Convictions Bill in our own time.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, for his initiative.  It is intended to introduce the electoral amendment Bill this session.  In regard to the question of agencies, the biggest criticism of any agency in the country is the HSE which got rid of 56 agencies and brought them into one.  Everyone gives out about that one.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The next argument then is that we have too many.  I make the point that, perhaps, it points to the fact that it is easier said than done.  That is the first point.  The agentising out of Government delivery of programmeshas been part of previous Civil Service reform programmes, including ones when the Labour Party was in Government, because it has the benefit, if properly done, to deliver services and have a focus on the delivery of a particular service.  My attitude to all of this is that at the end of the day it is not a simplistic equation of the fewer agencies, great services.  The problem is, whatever way we have to deal with it,depending on how they are organised, reforms will require us to apply different means of addressing these issuesdepending on the outcomes.  The issue is what guarantees better outcomes. I take the point that we have to review all of this.  The OECD has pointed this out.  I will set up a task force which I intend will report to Government before the end of the summer on how to implement that OECD report so we go about this in a proper way. The last thing we want to do with this is to put everything in and expect it will be honky dory.  Itis not as simple as that.  From my point of view, all proposals coming to Government in terms of the establishment of agencies will be critically assessed by us as to whether the task can be done by existing agencies or if agencies are being appointed, to what extent we can ensure they are focused on a particular issue and in a way that will maximise benefits to the citizen.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Last Thursday I raised the issue of the Nuclear Test Ban Bill, which has no explanatory memorandum.  Will you advise me, a Cheann Comhairle, if it is in accordance with Standing Orders that a Bill going through the House does not have an explanatory memorandum?  When I raised the issue the Tánaiste said she would organise a one-to-one for me with the Minister.  If I had a one-to-one I would have been told that should a bomb go off in this country we would be fined €5,000 and, perhaps, sent to jail for 12 months.  Given that such significant legislation is going through Committee Stage tomorrow, why is there no explanatory memorandum available which would make some of the more ridiculous aspects of the Bill clear to read?

In the course of the Order of Business last Thursday, the Deputy raised this matter and the Tánaiste indicated she should arrange for the appropriate Department to revert to the Deputy.  I have here a letter dated 13 May to the Deputy from the Office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stating the Nuclear Test Ban Bill will be before the Select Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for consideration on Committee Stage on Wednesday, 21 May.  The Department will be circulating an information note on the Bill to the committee members prior to the meeting and an explanatory memorandum will also be made available following reprint of the Bill, after Committee Stage.  There will be a note for the moment and after Committee Stage the explanatory memorandum.

The Tánaiste told the House on Thursday last that it is intended to bring the legislation through the two Houses before the summer recess.  As far as I can see there are only about seven weeks remaining.  When will that Bill be published given that we need adequate time to properly debate it in the Oireachtas?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Listening to the Taoiseach announce the appointments to the office of Minister of State, it struck me that multiple Ministers of State have been appointed to the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Will the Taoiseach publish formal, delegated orders for the duties, budget and powers of Ministers of State?  Without delegated functions and a budget, power and responsibility, a Minister of State, even one who serves in four different Departments, is a poor creature.I congratulate the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Mansergh.  While I am pleased for him, I note he has also been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism which struggles to occupy the time of one full Minister.  Given, as the Taoiseach indicated, that most of the Department's work is done by agencies, what will a Minister of State in the Department do?  I suppose he will attend openings of events.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, and the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, will ensure the State properly promotes, acknowledges and represents the cultural life of the nation and we do all we can to assist creative flair in all the arts.  The Minister of State, who has a particular interest and expertise in this area, will do this very well.  Joining up arts and the Minister of State's responsibility in respect of the heritage function of the Office of Public Works is entirely logical and complementary and fits his talents admirably.I join Deputy Burton in congratulating the Ministers of State and acknowledge the work of the outgoing Ministers of State.  There are always far more competent, able candidates than positions available.

Some Opposition Deputies will have known the elation and disappointment of days such as today.  We must be fair and I thank everybody for the courtesy shown to me in the good discussions I had with all the Ministers of State, both outgoing and incoming, on the role they can play in working with Ministers to ensure their work is valuable and fulfilling for them professionally, adds value to the Government's work and is well managed and presented.  This is a genuine sentiment and a hope I have for all those who have been privileged to have been asked to serve, including last week.  We intend to do this to the very best of our ability.  It is only fair, on a day like this, to make that point.

One would expect a Minister from Waterford to be well able to look after culture given the small size of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the large number of agencies involved in these areas.  What is the purpose of having multiple Ministers of State in one Department?  What will the five Ministers of State at the Department of Education and Science do when they sit down together?  Will they have delegated functions?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I will repeat my reply.  The Ministers of State will be given delegated functions.  Some of them have cross-cutting responsibilities.  The reason for having cross-cutting responsibilities and removing ridiculous distinctions between departmental silos is to make Ministers of State more effective and give them a wider remit to cover all the policy aspects that may reside in different Departments.  The discussion on Leaders' Questions was instructive in this regard.  Technically, the Office of the Minister for Children has three different policy areas, namely, justice, health and education.  These have been brought together and, as everyone will privately acknowledge — they should also do so publicly given the excellent leadership being provided at Civil Service level in that office — it is doing an outstanding job in its current construction, much better than would have been the case when it was acting separately in different Departments.We are trying to introduce innovative, more progressive ways to ensure Ministers of State are given an opportunity to show the full range of their talents by having access to various departmental areas in particular areas of activity.  For example, the area of children is covered by education and, as we have heard in respect of the child protection area, health, as well as justice in terms of juvenile justice issues and so on.  This approach is proving correct and similar approaches are being taken in the areas of elderly people and integration.  The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, faces a major challenge in the area of integration and will have the full support of all colleagues in trying to address this very important issue.Securing effective cross-cutting responsibility across Departments is something of a culture change in public administration.  Diligent, able and persistent Ministers are required to ensure they get the type of response, co-operation and outcomes they need.  This requires co-operation from all Ministers and I have been clear to everyone in government that I do not believe in territoriality or Ministers having functions that are not substantive.  All members of the Government have been given an onerous task which they will seek to perform conscientiously and on the basis of an esprit de corps in the Government that insists on everybody being respected and getting their job done in a co-operative and collegiate manner.  That is the way good Government operates and I intend to ensure it occurs.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12942	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I note the Taoiseach's use of the expression "departmental silos", which is new to me.  The legislative silo, as it pertains to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is fairly empty.  The legislative programme features three Bills for the Department, one of which is the animal health and welfare Bill.  I have been inundated recently——

When will the legislation come before the House?On the scarcity of global food supplies, given the lack of Government initiatives in this area, it would be pertinent to have a debate on the issue.

The legislation is in a public consultation process which must be completed before the heads of the Bill are prepared.Although the second issue the Deputy raised is not fully in order according to the Ceann Comhairle, it is an important matter.  It has come into sharp relief in the past six to nine months and it is having a major affect on the World Food Programme and on UN agencies and export tariffs are being raised by countries which are not exporting.  Rice, for example, is a staple food for billions of people and its price has trebled in the past four months.  There is real worry about what is happening.  It would be an excellent subject to debate in due course.

This is a typical example where responsibility crosses Departments, especially in regard to the educational needs of children with autism.  If he has not assigned responsibility, I ask him to do so as soon as possible.  There are ongoing difficulties between the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children in regard to back-up services, such as speech and other behavioural therapies.  We have an opportunity to deal with this issue once and for all.I recently tabled a parliamentary question asking if we could include a question in the next census asking if anyone in a household has autism in order that we know exactly what we are dealing with.

I do not believe it is about one Minister having responsibility for it across Departments but it is about Ministers liaising, planning, working, co-operating and networking to get these matters sorted to the greatest possible extent within the resources available.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Targaím:Go n-ainmníonn Dáil Éireann An tUasal Seán Ó Buachalla chun a cheaptha ag an tUachtarán mar Ard-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste.I move:That Dáil Éireann nominates Mr. John Buckley for appointment by the President to be the Comptroller and Auditor General.As Deputies know, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, is retiring with effect from 14 May 2008.  While this motion is about his replacement, it is appropriate that I begin by expressing my appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Purcell during his time as Comptroller and Auditor General.Mr. Purcell has been in this important position for almost 14 years and in that time he has carried out his functions in a very professional and effective manner.  As we all know, the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional one and is extremely important in terms of public accountability and the performance of the public service.  While the essential functions of the office remain as set out in the Constitution, its operation has evolved significantly during Mr. Purcell's tenure in line with developments in the general practice of audit in recent years and with various changes to strengthen accountability in Departments and other State agencies.The year before Mr. Purcell's appointment, the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 enhanced the nature of the audit process by giving the Comptroller and Auditor General a new statutory role in relation to economy, efficiency and effectiveness, that is to say value for money, about which I will say more later.Mr. Purcell has, therefore, had to lead his office through a period of extensive change, with additional demands and skill requirements on him and his staff.  He has fulfilled that role in exemplary fashion and leaves a legacy of considerable achievement.The Office of Comptroller and Auditor General was originally provided for under the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866.  Article 33 of the Constitution sets down the responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of his role as comptroller in controlling, on behalf of the State, all disbursements of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and in terms of his role as auditor in auditing the accounts of Departments and State bodies for regularity and accuracy.  In accordance with the Constitution, the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann and reports to Dáil Éireann at stated periods as determined by law.The Constitution also provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by the Dáil and Seanad calling for such removal.  This underlines the independent status of this important office.The terms and conditions of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General are determined by law and the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General must be seen in relation to the very significant developments in the public sector since Mr. Purcell's appointment nearly 14 years ago.As I mentioned, the Comptroller and Auditor General has a statutory mandate since 1993 in relation to economy, effectiveness and efficiency.  This value for money function was an important new power given to the Comptroller and Auditor General providing him with the discretion to examine and report on the economy and efficiency of Departments and bodies, which are expected to have in place the necessary systems to evaluate the effectiveness of their operations.  These systems are subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.It is worth mentioning, however, that section 11 of the 1993 Act prohibits the Comptroller and Auditor General from questioning or expressing an opinion on the merits of policies or of policy objectives.  The Act applies the same prohibition to Accounting Officers in the performance of their statutory duties.  Both of these restrictions are reflected in the terms of reference of the Committee of Public Accounts.All of this is in accordance with the long-standing tradition that, in policy matters, Ministers are answerable to this House.  This also reflects the position in many other countries that the national auditor should not become involved in policy, which is the prerogative of the Government with accountability to Parliament.Since Mr. Purcell's appointment as Comptroller and Auditor General, there have been considerable developments in public sector management systems, particularly in Departments.  During that time our public services have been expanded, improved and reformed.  There have been significant improvements in the areas of financial management, human resources management, regulatory reform, e-Government initiatives and customer service delivery.However, we must also acknowledge that many more changes are both awaited and needed.  This is why the Government asked the OECD to undertake a review of the Irish public service.  The report of this review was published recently.  It acknowledges the central role played by the public service in contributing to an economic success story that many OECD countries would like to emulate.  It states we are on a sound trajectory of modernisation but that we could further improve the yield from reforms by renewing focus on their pace and sequencing in order to make them more mutually reinforcing.  The review marks an important step in the ongoing modernisation of the public service.The Taoiseach will, shortly, announce the appointment of a task force on public service reform to report to the Government with a comprehensive programme for action.  There has also been a significant enhancement of governance arrangements in the public service in recent years.  For example, in Departments and offices the recommendations of the report of the working group on the accountability of Secretaries General and Accounting Officers have been implemented.  Internal audit services have been strengthened and audit committees with independent chairpersons have been established to support Accounting Officers in the discharge of their duties.  There is now a greater emphasis on the formal identification, assessment and management of risk and on the effectiveness of the systems of internal financial control.In the semi-State sector too, there have been moves to improve corporate governance in line with best practice in the private sector.  The revised code of practice for the governance of State bodies, published in 2001, is now well established and is proving to be a sound basis for making progress towards better financial control and governance in State sponsored bodies within the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit remit.  Accountability has been further strengthened with the addition of a requirement that Accounting Officers and chairpersons of State bodies submit statements of internal financial control annually with their financial statements.An enhanced value for money framework has been put in place in recent years.  The specific elements of the framework include the following: The implementation of rolling five year multi-annual capital envelopes for better management and control of public capital programmes and projects.  The envelopes allow for the carryover of up to 10% of unspent Exchequer capital into the following year. They are designed to give Departments and agencies more certainty about the level of resources available to them in the medium term and more flexibility to plan and manage their capital programmes; the publication, in February 2005, of new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector; the additional value for money measures relating to major capital projects, ICT projects and consultancies codified in a Department of Finance circular letter of 25 January 2006, in particular the appointment of project managers for all capital projects with responsibility for monitoring and managing project progress; the introduction of value for money and policy reviews, replacing the former expenditure review initiative; the establishment of the central expenditure evaluation unit in the Department of Finance to promote best practice in the evaluation and appraisal of programme and project expenditure; reforms to public procurement, including the introduction of the national public procurement policy framework for implementation by public bodies and, from 2007, reforms to public construction contracts and the system for employing construction-related consultants; and the presentation to Dáil select committees of annual output statements, together with the Estimates, which set out the public service outputs that are expected to be delivered for the year ahead with the financial resources, the inputs, that are being voted on.These output statements were presented to the Dáil committees for the first time in 2007.  The 2008 round of annual output statements, now being considered by the relevant committees, includes a report of performance against the previous year's objectives, as well as setting out new public service performance objectives for the year ahead.  As the annual output statements become embedded, the focus will be on improving the quality and relevance of the output targets or performance indictors.Taken together, these reforms mark a significant move towards best practice internationally, in terms of delivering high quality public services in an effective and efficient manner.  They have helped improve the capacity of the public sector to ensure that public funds are put to good use.As I mentioned, the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be appointed by the President on the nomination of Dáil Éireann.  Members of the House, especially those who served on the Committee of Public Accounts, are aware of the responsibilities of the post.  Having fully considered the matter, and following consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition parties, the Government recommends the nomination of Mr. John Buckley to succeed Mr. Purcell.  Mr. Buckley is the Secretary of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and director of audit.  Currently, he directs the office's value for money audit function.  He has many years service in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I understand that his performance in his current senior position in that office is exemplary.  Over his career to date he has worked in all divisions of the office.  By profession, he is an accountant and a barrister.The new Comptroller and Auditor General will take up his appointment during a period in which increasing attention has been paid to the value for money obtained from public funds.  Value for money in all sectors of the economy is key to sustaining economic growth into the future.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has a key role to play in this respect.  I am satisfied that Mr. Buckley will make an excellent Comptroller and Auditor General.  I recommend his nomination to the Dáil.

I am surprised, however, that he has been selected to come and respond to this debate on what is, as he outlined in his contribution, a debate not just about the appointment of Mr. John Buckley, which we commend, but about the procedures of financial control that operate in the House.  I do not make this comment frivolously.  This is an important debate and we should have a Minister who is in a position to make changes here to respond to the debate.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20148	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	194	That is not in doubt.  The point is the Minister represents a Government that should respond to some of the issues that are raised with regard to how we control our finances, but does not have a role in that regard.  That role has been vested in a different Minister.  I wish the Minister did have a role because I suspect he would give a more sympathetic hearing to some of the changes I would like to propose.That said, I thank Mr. John Purcell, who is here tonight, for his outstanding contribution and for the quality of the reports he produced and their enormous value in forming the work of this House.  The truth is, were it not for the beacon of light coming from the Committee of Public Accounts, and the Comptroller and Auditor General in particular, we would be stumbling around in the dark most of the time about what is happening in Departments with public moneys.  It is a shame that is how it is.We should reform and extend the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General so that it does not so much focus after the event on past failures and sob over the milk that has been spilled, but considers why Departments keep making the same mistakes.  This week a report on procurement was issued.  We had a similar report in 2005 when several other agencies had their knuckles rapped about procurement and another in 2002.  This is a recurring theme, but Ministers who come in to respond to the debate on the reports do not change anything.  We still have agencies under ministerial control that breach public procurement rules.  Something has broken down in the system, but I do not believe the Minister for Education and Science will come in and be accountable for what is happening.We need to examine the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and recognise that system-wide failures arise time and again in its reports.  The management of major change is one of them.  We have not delivered in that regard.  Recent major change projects include e-Government, the Ballymun regeneration project, the national revaluation of property by the Valuation Office and the integrated public transport ticketing project.  We were to break through to something different to govern in a different way but in every case we have failed to deliver.  The e-Government project was 50% off target.  I cannot remember the result of the Ballymun regeneration project but it cost double the amount anticipated and was off target.  The national revaluation project imploded after property in just one county was tested.  We spent €10 million on the integrated ticketing project and have nothing to show for it.  No Minister ever puts his or her hand above the rampart and admits something happened on his or her watch.  Nobody is responsible.  These are major changes of significant importance to Ireland in moving to anticipate the challenges in our becoming part of the knowledge economy, using electronics intelligently in the distribution of services to save money and so on, and we are failing dismally.The list of failures could include decentralisation, the climate change strategy and the costing of new initiatives, especially political pet projects.  Governments come into the House on budget day and bring forward proposals for which they have no solid costings.  No Minister takes responsibility; the same mistakes are repeated and we do not learn.  The costing of major capital projects is another problem.  Invariably — not just in Ireland — those who promote capital projects have a very rosy view of what they will cost.  They propose them to governments, get them to commit and afterwards the costs prove entirely different from those first anticipated.  That is a recurring theme and we are doing nothing about it.  Management and procurement of ICT projects is another area of chronic weakness.  I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is not waiting to hear the end of the debate having said he would be in a position to respond.  ICT projects are crucial.  However, PPARS, the e-voting project and procurement in many agencies have gone adrift.  This is a problem in other jurisdictions, not just in ours.  Procurement flaws recur repeatedly.There needs to be an extension of the Comptroller and Auditor General's role to examine the reasons these problems are continually repeated in other areas, assess whether there are problems in the corporate governance of Departments and agencies and examine the skills and experience lacking in many Departments to manage projects of this nature.  That is crucial.  Anybody examining the OECD report on why we have quadrupled public spending in many areas without delivering at the front line on the scale we would have expected needs answers to these questions.  We have a service that provides a beacon of light, yet we do not learn from it.  It is not informing the way we debate or spend public money.The Oireachtas needs to completely reform how we spend our money.  That goes to the heart of what this debate should be about.  Our system of financial scrutiny is hopelessly outdated and has been made worse by changes in the last budget, whereby decisions on spending and taxes are made on one day out without a notion of scrutiny, there is a vote at the end of the debate and it is all over for the year.  That is the most ludicrous way of spending money.  No other parliament would tolerate it.  There is no serious scrutiny of the Estimates, despite the absent Minister saying expenditure evaluation has been a key part of governance.  That is not the case.  The Public Service Management Act intended that we would have evaluation as part of a rolling three-year programme.  As it stands, it will take approximately 50 years to have evaluation across the programmes that are supposed to be evaluated.  The expenditure evaluation has melted down.  More importantly, a high level report by the Secretaries General indicated that performance evaluation had no impact on subsequent budgetary decisions; therefore, even the little that is being done has no impact on how money is spent.Ministers are opting out of their responsibilities to put proper strategy statements in place.  It will surprise the Acting Chairman to know that when Deputy Bertie Ahern resigned as Taoiseach, eight of his Ministers had not produced any strategy statement.  They were obliged to provide such statements within six months of taking office to give direction to their Departments and the agencies under them.  Within 12 months, with new Ministers being appointed, eight of the 15 had not done so.  How does one expect public servants to take seriously the strategy and direction of their agencies or Departments if the Minister who is supposed to give strategic direction is still sitting on his or her hands 12 months after being appointed?Key performance indicators are totally underdeveloped.  The Comptroller and Auditor General could provide a very valuable new service for the Oireachtas in examining the inadequacy of key performance indicators as they have been produced in the output statements which have come approximately nine years later than intended.  The other major issue which has become more of a focus, particularly under the OECD, is that agencies have little or no scrutiny in and no accountability to this House.  This outsourcing of government and managing of public spending as if scrutiny does not matter and the Oireachtas should not examine how money is spent is at the heart of the failure of public service reform.  After a decade of great economic opportunity and Ministers talking about public service reform on the back of the 1997 Act we have had no such reform and the OECD tells us we are way off the mark and have become far too reliant on the fragmentation of government into numerous agencies.  What is worse, not only are we fragmenting them, but we are imposing these totally inflexible controls on them in order that they can do nothing.  We do not even get the advantage, that multiple agencies closer to the coalface have flexibility in responding to events.  Their pay, grades and numbers are tied in.  Everything is locked in through a highly centralised system from the Department of Finance.  Once cannot have delegation and effective delivery of services at the front line with such absolute control.  One must trust one's local managers, delegate responsibility and hold them accountable for their failures.  This House should be much more systematically informed of the weaknesses in how we scrutinise money.The Comptroller and Auditor General or his successor would not feel they have the right to tell the House we are failing in our duties to scrutinise public spending because they would not believe that is their remit.  However, we are failing in our responsibilities in this House because the system does not allow it.  The previous Committee of Public Accounts highlighted some of these deficiencies and talked about having an Estimates commissioner to help us in our work in order that we could become more professional, but that is the first and last we heard of it.  In introducing the new Comptroller and Auditor General no mention has been made of a previous report from the committee which, no doubt, the Comptroller and Auditor General's expertise helped inform.We must move into the 21st century in how we approach public spending.  The notion that Departments can have pet projects, undertake cost-benefit analyses and not publish them is unacceptable.  Cost-benefit analyses are to inform this House on whether we are making good decisions and should not be kept as the property of those who put them together.  Allowing people to judge their own cases is a recipe for ineffective decision making.  Evaluation should not allow people to be judges of their own cases.Unfortunately, I am coming to the end of my time and I am whistling in the dark to some degree.  I do not think there will be a response from the Government.  I congratulate Mr. Buckley on his appointment.  Although I am critical of the fact that the post was not advertised for open competition, I am not critical of Mr. Buckley's capability.  I am sure he would have been selected.  I know from colleagues that he is extremely capable and will bring enormous skills to bear on the job.  Open competition is a matter of principle the OECD tells us we should apply.  Governments have stated it is their approach to top level appointments and I do not understand why it was not done in this instance.  However, that is not a criticism of the appointment made, which I am glad to endorse.I wish Mr. Buckley well in his work.  As I stated, he is the one beacon of light available to the House in informing us objectively how money is spent.  I look forward to the day when his role is expanded and we will have a much more professional approach within the House to the way we do our important work.  It is the fear of being caught out and held accountable that is driving Ministers' agendas.  That culture filters right down through the system.  Sadly, there have been numerous cases in which Ministers with their own pet projects bent all the rules and saw nothing untoward about it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	197	First, I congratulate Mr. John Purcell, the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, on his outstanding public service during his period in office.  He has been an outstanding public servant.  I know many of the people who have worked with him on his staff and he has been a leader in the development of public service auditing and reporting in a way that has marked him out as being among the best in Europe in seeking to use the position of Comptroller and Auditor General in the way intended in the Constitution as a further mechanism to ensure accountability in the way taxpayers' money which is hard earned before it is handed over to the taxman is used for the public good.  During the time I served on the Committee of Public Accounts which was brief but extremely instructive Mr. Purcell always kept in view the taxpayer's entitlement to an account of how his or her money had been spent; to know whether, with due consideration and expert examination, it had been spent properly for the purposes set down by the Government and reported to the House, and whether value for money had been achieved.Value for money reporting has been one of the most innovative developments that Mr. Purcell has undertaken.  I hope this is something the new Comptroller and Auditor General will not only continue, but expand.  I recall many outstanding reports which Mr. Purcell produced and published.  For instance, the report on PPARS sought to set out what exactly had happened to this €150 million or €160 million project and how in the spending of this enormous sum of taxpayers' money the goal of the project was not achieved.I am particularly conscious that Mr. Purcell produced many ground-breaking reports on tax collection and the efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners who operate at a high level.  Nowadays there is roughly the same number of Revenue staff collecting vastly more taxes and through the use of computerisation, they have massively increased productivity and efficiency.  By showing the extent to which certain very wealthy individuals in Irish society have the privilege not only of being wealthy through their own good fortune but through the tax laws of being in a position to make little or no contribution to the tax coffers, Mr. Purcell did the public an important service.Mr. Purcell also commented on pet constituency projects of Ministers at different times when there was more money available than at present and they could be flaithiúlach.  I recall, for instance, reports on the proposed Bertie bowl at Abbottstown in Dublin 15 and on spending on the upgrading of Punchestown, a pet project of the former Minister for Finance and now Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  In fact, some of these projects, while laudable, could almost be constituted vanity projects on the part of Ministers who considered that once they had the money, they could throw it in any direction they liked.I wish the incoming Comptroller and Auditor General well.  He has worked with Mr. Purcell and will bring to the job much experience of auditing, public service management and the peculiarities of public service accounting, which is really an esoteric science that few, including Mr. Buckley, understand.  Although the old saying, an auditor is a watchdog, not a bloodhound, is repeated endlessly, it is important because the watchdog has oversight powers.  The bloodhound often goes after pennies and one does not learn much of modern management.With the last budget, we have moved into a new era of public accounting in which we now receive output reports, many of which, to put it charitably, are deeply challenging in that they do not say anything about serious outputs.  Rather they tend to confirm that Departments met all of the objectives they were set but they do not really tell us what happened and whether the money was well spent.  This is a critical issue with which Mr. Buckley must grapple and he will be challenged to be as innovative as Mr. Purcell was on value for money audits.On a technical point, under the Constitution this appointment is made by Dáil Éireann on the nomination of Government.  I regret that there was no real consultation with Opposition party leaders and spokespersons on finance in filling this important position.  There was a courtesy telephone call from the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, after the decision had been made.  That is not good enough.  That is not what the Constitution provides for in terms of consultation.  I do not want to take in any way from Mr. Buckley's appointment because I know he will be a fine public servant in the established tradition, but it is important that the Opposition should be consulted.  We are still not clear on the procedures for the appointment within the Civil Service.  We do not know whether it is a promotional opportunity and a limited number of people can apply.  We do not know if it is made under the new Civil Service regime under which appointments are meant to be the subject to a degree of open competition.  We do not even know if there were other candidates for the job.  In saying this I am not implying anything about Mr. Buckley, but querying the mechanisms under which the appointment was made.  I do not think it is satisfactory that consultation with the other parties in the Dáil consists simply of a telephone call by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, after the event.I wish the new Comptroller and Auditor General well.  As he probes the mysteries of Government accounting and explains it to the rest of us, I hope that he enjoys the job.  I also hope that he is able to imbue the staff in his office with the same kind of spirit, teamwork and sheer service that the staff in that office have always offered to those of us who have been privileged to be members of the Committee of Public Accounts.

I was honoured to be reappointed to the Committee of Public Accounts for the 30th Dáil following my service to the Committee of Public Accounts of the 27th Dáil.  During my first period of service on the committee, Mr. John Purcell was appointed Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the intervening 14 years, he has discharged the duties of this crucial office with great distinction and thorough professionalism.  As I remarked last week at his last appearance with his audit team in front of the committee, he has been a role model for excellence in the public service.Throughout the past 14 years he has launched a plethora of invigilatory innovations in the auditing area to ensure that the people's money was spent to the best possible effect.  The Minister referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and the famous three "e"s of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.  The long list of value for money reports produced in this era is a clear record of that achievement.  However, Mr. Purcell's weekly statements to the committee on the annual reports and appropriation accounts have always been lucid and concise, and they forensically identified the key points of concern in the audit trails of countless expenditure programmes of the 41 Votes and Departments under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He invariably raised vital issues under the spending headings and gently prodded committee members in the main direction of  investigation.To the public, he will be forever identified with the watershed DIRT inquiry when as Comptroller and Auditor General, ably assisted by my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, and the other members of the Committee of Public Accounts of the 28th Dáil, he dissected and unravelled one of the greatest scandals in Ireland's taxation and commercial history.  We all remember the famous hearings of that inquiry, when many members of the public listened on a minute by minute basis to the proceedings of the committee.  The DIRT reports form a vital platform for the invigilation of taxation and tax evasion for the future in this country.In the past number of weeks, committee members have witnessed the unfurling of another major scandal, which is the overspend of €70 million on the drainage infrastructure in Limerick.  Mr. Purcell and his team did an exceptional job in unravelling and reporting a fiasco that occurred under the watch of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Accounting Officers are often placed on the spot in front of the committee for gross mistakes in expenditure when the political head of the Department should take responsibility, which in this case was the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.I wish Mr. Purcell and his family great happiness in whatever field or services he now enters.  I hope that the removal of the immense public service burden of being Comptroller and Auditor General will allow him time for association football and for all his other interests.I reiterate my warm welcome, on behalf of the Labour Party, to Mr. John Buckley as the new Comptroller and Auditor General.  As the State has developed and grown through the Celtic tiger period, the necessity for very tight financial controls in expenditure becomes ever more important.  There are so many elements of State expenditure where good forward planning, risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis are critical.  These are the lessons which we have learned due to the invigilation of the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General.Deputy Bruton referred to the problem we have with Estimates.  I recall a key recommendation from the report of the DIRT inquiry that we would have an independent official who would report to this House on Estimates in a timely way.  Following the report of the DIRT inquiry, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, responded to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in a Department of Finance minute.  The response indicated that we might have seen very fundamental reform of the Estimates by developing good cost-benefit analysis and by planning expenditure.  Unfortunately, those hopes have been dashed over the past eight or nine years.  Despite the outcome reports mentioned by the Minister, year after year we end up discussing Estimates many months into the spending of those Estimates.  That is a completely ludicrous situation.  The committee should return to the final report of the DIRT inquiry and see if we can get some development on the expenditure side.There is a range of important issues to which we must constantly return at the Committee of Public Accounts.  For example, last week I raised the issue of a new tranche of public private partnerships with the Minister for Transport.  I questioned his current expenditure, and my questioning was based on financial concerns rather than ideological concerns.  There are massive budgets in health and transport and we need very strict and determined audit practices.I welcome the decision to hold the debate today, which I proposed at a recent Whips' meeting, given the importance of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General in a parliamentary democracy.  There are also interesting innovations in other states which we could examine in the future.  In Australia, the public accounts committee itself must approve the appointment of an incoming comptroller and auditor general.I wish Mr. Buckley well in the coming months and years.  He has a hard act to follow, given that our outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General has served this nation very well.  I salute him as a great public servant and a great Irishman.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the nomination by the Dáil of Mr. John Buckley to the important Office of Comptroller and Auditor General, as provided for by Article 33 of Bunreacht na h-Éireann.I pay tribute to the work of Mr. John Purcell, the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, who has held this post for the past 14 years.  He carried out his functions with professionalism and competence during the course of that period.  During that time, Mr. Purcell has overseen very significant changes in auditing techniques, with a growing emphasis on technology and computer systems auditing.  The workload and responsibilities of his office expanded significantly in that time and the office has responded well to these demands.  The work of the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General should challenge all of us in public life to work towards the highest standards of financial probity among all public sector bodies.I wish Mr. Buckley every success in his new post.  He is well qualified for the position and has accrued a wealth of experience in his time working at the office.  I know that he will have the full support of the Oireachtas in carrying out his important functions.  The expenditure of public funds must be fully accountable and transparent in all respects.  Value for money must be the cornerstone of all expenditure decisions.  While the work of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has become synonymous with ensuring value for money in recent times, the auditing and oversight role of the office is equally important.  The office audits over 350 public bodies, with 142 non-commercial State bodies being the largest bloc.  It carries out an enormous amount of work in auditing alone every year, not to mention value for money and special reports.  My background is in auditing, accounting and finance and I appreciate the importance of examining and reporting on the books and records of an organisation but also the financial processes and systems used, which are constantly evolving.  The auditing function can lead to real improvements to the financial administration of organisations by identifying system weaknesses and recommending improvements.  Thereby, it can save money for the taxpayer if public sector bodies can implement improvements.  It is essential that proper internal controls are designed and implemented.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is placing particular emphasis on this, particularly in recent times.In the private sector we have seen the growth of importance of internal controls, having checks and balances so that deficiencies are identified prior to the annual statutory audit.  Departments and public sector bodies are now operating in an environment where compliance is increasingly important.  The requirements for proper risk assessment, compliance with modern corporate governance and legislative requirements are placing a serious onus on all budget holders and Accounting Officers in the public and private sectors.Public bodies should not view scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General as a burden but as an opportunity to improve the way they do business.  They may identify steps that result in improvements in service efficiency and financial administration.  The work of the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be seen as a bulwark of bureaucracy and procedure for the sake of it.  The public service should not be bogged down in form filling and requisition reports and lose sight of the real role it has, serving Irish citizens.  Embracing the spirit of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General means that those benefits can be tangible and can deliver real improvement to the people.Value for money is at the centre of the work of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, particularly in recent times.  Some of the speakers on this motion have alluded to the significant reports on that area.  It is essential that all public sector bodies ensure that value for money is the number one priority.  I welcome the value for money and policy review initiative of the Department of Finance.  Some 92 reports were completed in 2006-08 and by the end of 2008 a number of significant additional reports will be completed on mental health services, the efficiency of long-stay residential care for adults, special needs assistants and grants to first and second level schools.  This work will be undertaken under the value for money and policy review initiative, which underlines the value of the work done under this initiative.The Department of Finance has established the central expenditure evaluation unit, which will carry out important work on expenditure on a range of projects.  I recognise the important role of the Committee of Public Accounts in liaising with the Comptroller and Auditor General in scrutinising his reports, along with the value for money reports and the special reports.  He has completed important work on a number of special reports and one recent report, Special Report 10: General Matters arising on Audits — Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, Health Sector Bodies, Vocational Education Committees, is an example of the importance of the work of the office.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was critical of the fact that expenditure of some public bodies was done without the necessary agreement of the relevant funding Department.  This is a fundamental issue, picked up on by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the report, which also identified shortcomings regarding procurement, governance and financial management.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done us great service by identifying these issues but it is important that the recommendations are embraced and changes implemented to improve the efficiency of the way they do business and provide services to the public within a financial framework that is efficient and ensures value for money.In the private sector, where an external auditor issues a management letter to a company arising from an interim or final audit, one of the first things the auditor will do when he goes back the next year is to check that the recommendations have been acted upon.  I hope a similar approach will be adopted in a rigid manner by the public sector.I am pleased that the new Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, identified public sector reform as a priority for his Government.  I welcome the publication of the OECD report on the public service, commissioned by the Government.  I believe it will implement the recommendations arising from it.  The Taoiseach will appoint a task force on public service reform shortly.  This was an important step in moving to an era where value for money is at the centre of all public expenditure decisions.I wish Mr. John Buckley every success in his new role and I look forward to interacting with him as a public representative.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I commend Mr. John Purcell on his fantastic work over the past 14 years.  Like Deputy Michael McGrath, I am an accountant but I am not a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Looking around the Chamber, all I see are accountants.All the reports I have read since I came into the Dáil last year have a common theme.  The PPARS report was before my time but the e-Government report is an example.  The key theme is the lack of financial planning on major projects and lack of expertise in major reports.  The most recent report, Special Report 10: General Matters arising on Audits — Non-Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, Health Sector Bodies, Vocational Education Committees, is a summation of the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General over many years.  He identified the key issues, which were very straightforward in terms of value for money.  This included money drawn down by Departments that will not be spent for months and left on the balance sheet at the end of the year.  This is bad use of the public purse.  We must examine reform.  Government bodies and Departments are drawing down funding at the end of the year to ensure the budget will be retained the following year.  It is bad value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2006 report, and Deputy Broughan earlier in this debate, referred to the Estimates and the lack of opportunity for interaction with Deputies before they are voted on.We must have procedures whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General has greater powers at an earlier stage.  I wish Mr. John Buckley well and hope the role will be extended so that the Comptroller and Auditor General has an input in major projects early on and there is a level of control.Under the 1993 Act, the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General was extended to include value for money, which is critical.  We are in a period where the economy is in slowdown and the spending of money must be adjudicated in a tighter fashion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a worthwhile role to play in terms of his expertise in regard to the systems within Departments and Government bodies.  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about management letters which is, in layman's terms, the identification by an auditor of difficulties in internal controls and instructions to management by letter to act upon them.  This is effectively what happens by way of the annual report.  However, all of this work is pointless if no action is taken.The 2006 annual report highlighted poor and substandard accounting systems within the HSE.  I read the report when published and raised this matter in the House at the time.  While this problem was corroborated by the Accounting Officer from the Department Finance, it took the Government more than six months to respond to it.  The Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has now instigated a review of the accounting systems within the HSE.  It is critical action is taken to address this problem.The Estimates are based on 55,000 house completions.  Every analysis available states they should be based on 30,000 to 35,000 completions, leaving a €2 billion shortfall.  What we need is a proper Estimates process, a proper debate in this House and proper scrutiny of ongoing projects by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Important points were made earlier in regard to large-scale projects such as the e-Government project.  Approximately €420 million was spent on such projects, many of which ran over time and budget.  Some €35 million was spent on the development of a website which allowed public access to information on Government services.  However, the site is not functioning properly and this should have been picked up on earlier.  It is important the Comptroller and Auditor General is called in earlier to scrutinise projects above a certain threshold, for example, in the form of an interim audit, to ensure we are obtaining value for money.Mr. John Purcell took the role of Comptroller and Auditor General to another level.  He examined issues in an in-depth and forensic fashion.  One does not need to be an accountant to understand the 2006 annual report; anyone can read it, which is important.  We should ensure reports continue to be produced this way.  I wish Mr. Purcell and his family well on his retirement.  I also congratulate Mr. John Buckley on his appointment.  I am sure we will have some dealings with him in the future.  I believe the task ahead of him is an onerous one.The Taoiseach must remain committed to public sector reform.  Government Deputies mentioned earlier he is instigating public sector reform.  However, this issue was repeatedly highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General's in his annual reports down through the years.  We need to extend the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to include the introduction of an early warning system which will allow us to identify potential problems and to take the appropriate corrective action before valuable taxpayers' money has been wasted.The Taoiseach needs to give to the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to drive improvements in governance and management systems in State bodies before disasters occur and he should ensure State agencies and public bodies are more accountable to the Oireachtas.  That is critical.  Former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, confirmed at a meeting of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service many of the points made in regard to large-scale projects.  In many cases, large projects within Government Departments are dealt with by people involved in ongoing tasks.  We need to set up specific teams that can do this work Department by Department.  On e-Government, a strong argument has been made for the appointment of a specific team to deal with this work to ensure consistency.I strongly favour a move towards multi-annual budgeting.  We are all aware of Departments seeking to spend money at the end of the year purely to ensure they utilise their budgets.  This is a false economy and poor value for money for the Exchequer.  In summary, we must ensure we have proper public sector reform and that the Comptroller and Auditor General is involved in that reform at the initial and final stages.  Also, we must move towards multi-annual budgeting.I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Martin Mansergh on his appointment as Minister of State at the Departments of Finance, with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, and Arts, Sport and Tourism, with special responsibility for the arts, and to wish my colleague, Deputy Peter Power from Limerick East, all the best on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, with special responsibility for overseas development.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I take the opportunity to congratulate Deputy Martin Mansergh on his new appointment.  I have no doubt he will do an excellent job as he has done in the past.I note a number of accountants have spoken on the motion this evening.  I thought this House was overrun by teachers and barristers.  I am delighted to note we have a number of accountants also, more than we had in the previous Dáil.As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I have had a particular insight into the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I take this opportunity to wish Mr. John Purcell well in his retirement.  He leaves with plenty of life and jizz in him yet.  I know he will have many other things to do with the time spent previously in the office.  I also wish his successor, Mr. John Buckley, every success in his new and difficult role.I am sure when Mr. Purcell compares the amounts of money he audited 14 years ago to those being audited now he will admit there has been a quantum leap in the scale of responsibilities and economic activity in all Departments.  One cannot simply apply the same old methods when the scale of activity changes to this extent.The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General is important in any democracy.  It is important this is set out in the Constitution and that there is all-party agreement in respect of that role.  The Comptroller and Auditor General must not only be independent of Government but of the Dáil in every situation.I wish to be associated with the praise expressed to Mr. John Purcell for his work as Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, we would be a little dishonest if we did not admit to regular mutterings in respect of his lambasting of the Government, Ministers and Accounting Officers.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	202	That depends on which side of the House one is sitting.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I believe such mutterings serve as a compliment to Mr. Purcell.  I prefer that we have an auditor who puts people to the pin of their collar rather than one who produces a clean report year on year.  I am sure many a Government Minister was embarrassed by his reports and this is as it should be.  Many Accounting Officers would have preferred if certain reports had not seen the light of day, which is also as it should be.  Without that little bit of edge between the Comptroller and Auditor General and Accounting Officers, things would become too cosy.  I say this by way of a compliment, not a criticism.  It would be false to state everybody was always delighted with every report.  Reports would not serve much purpose if this was the way because they would end up on a shelf and not be dissected in the way they have been in the past.  Long may it continue that upset is caused by the publication of various reports.The reports published are annual reports with special reports on value for money audits being produced on an intermittent basis.  They have become more frequent in recent years, as, perhaps, has the need for them.  During my membership of the Committee of Public Accounts I have noticed many themes, one of which is the lack of consistency with regard to information technology programmes in various Departments where the final figure is often three times the initial estimate.Another issue highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General is the accusation or implication of overspending on infrastructural projects.  While this was the case in many projects, I am equally adamant there was a significant degree of underbudgeting initially.  I always believe there are two sides to a story.  If people gave a realistic cost, the Minister of Finance might tell the relevant Minister a project was not feasible.  I sincerely believe people submit what is termed in the construction industry a "PC sum" for the building of a railway line, motorway or hospital.  By this I mean they submit a figure which seems reasonable in the full knowledge that it is only the starting point.  This often added to tension.  I hope it has led to better contracts being drawn up because as a result of the examination of these issues, new construction contracts have been approved by the Government.  They reflect the risk being transferred to the private sector as opposed to being carried by the taxpayer.  That is how it should be because if it is going to make profits, it should accept some of the risk.Policy issues are outside the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, his reports highlight matters which must be dealt with.  This includes the fundamental lack of commercial ability within the public service.  It is not the role of civil servants to be commercial managers.  They are ordinary people recruited into the Civil Service.  They work their way up the line and find themselves in a position where they negotiate multi-million euro contracts with people involved in the private sector whose day-to-day jobs are in the commercial world.  Sometimes, it is like sharks and pinkeens competing with each other.  Some Departments do very good jobs and it would be useful for this to be highlighted in special reports in order that others can learn from them.  We all hear about the difficulties but there are also good stories from which people should also learn.We have had a great deal of discussion on the quality of the annual reports which are extremely readable.  I agree.  However, I have always stated I would prefer to see more graphs and charts included in the reports.  I subscribe to the theory that one picture states more than 1,000 words.  A Sunday newspaper in publishing the results of an opinion poll could have column after column explaining the changes in percentages.  However, a chart or graph would show the changes immediately.  People are now far more used to looking at charts than they used to be.  They would find they absorb the detail of the report quicker through graphs.  While the reports are readable, those of us on the Committee of Public Accounts and some members of the public do not have as much time as we should to read them.  Graphs would give us a greater grasp of the information provided.I will always remember the PPARS issue which arose when the Health Service Executive went to computerise the payroll system and other human resource facilities.  It had 2,700 payroll items.  Various hospitals had different regimes for nurses, split shifts, bank holidays and systems under which there was time off to go to mass on holy days.  Amazing things happened.  Due to a lack of commercial expertise in the public service, the HSE tried to sort out this managerial mess without changes and we ended up with a computerised mess.  The project did not proceed as far as it should have.  The lesson learned is that we need to streamline systems before we computerise them.I would like to see more training for Accounting Officers, a number of whom are excellent Secretaries General but they are not all excellent Accounting Officers.  I do not know what training is provided in this regard.  As it is an important aspect of their work, I would like to see further training provided for them.An issue continually highlighted at the Committee of Public Accounts is that people who make decisions are no longer around to answer when a report is published.  They are promoted, move to another Department or retire.  My straightforward view is that if they are still employed in the public service, they should be brought back to answer for decisions they took previously.Everything I state to Mr. Purcell is in good spirit and he will understand my teasing him a little when I state not everybody was happy with everything.  He knows this.  I hope I will be able to state the same if I have been re-elected by the people of Laois-Offaly when Mr. Buckley retires.  I hope there will be an edge to his reports because it is important that everybody in a democracy, in maintaining checks and balances, has someone to keep an eye on them.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  It is my first duty to congratulate Deputy Mansergh on his appointment as Minister of State.  I wish him well in his new portfolio.  He played a major role in Northern Ireland, working with many Taoisigh.  Living in a Border area, I appreciate more than most where we started from and where we are now.  Deputy Mansergh deserves the promotion he received.I pay tribute to Mr. John Purcell who was Comptroller and Auditor General for many years.  The Committee of Public Accounts has done a tremendous job under his guidance and with his involvement.  He has done a tremendous job in highlighting some of the difficulties in the financial area and how various structures are run.I welcome Mr. John Buckley whom I do not know.  If it comes back to haunt me in years to come, I do not want to be blamed for his appointment.  I wish him well.  He has a major job to do.  The amount of money involved is absolutely colossal.  The health budget is €16 billion, which creates many opportunities for saving and wasting money.I want to use my time to speak about spending.  As I see it, in some areas there is no control over how money is spent.  We can examine the Punchestown project as an example.  I sat on committees with the former Deputy, Alan Dukes.  At the time we were advised by a Minister on how useful the project would be but we were not given all of the facts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the absolute abuse and waste of money during that project.The Dublin Port tunnel is a great job but the final cost compared with the initial estimate was vastly different.  It is difficult to understand how somebody can be refused home help for half an hour because money is scarce but millions can be overspent on such a project.  It is extraordinary that while everybody accepts significant moneys were wasted on the project, nobody was held responsible and nobody's head rolled.  A private business would not last very long if that was the practice.The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted many issues in the past and, unfortunately, will have no problem finding issues in the future.  The other problem with the Dublin Port tunnel is that it is not designed for oversized lorries that carry lightweight product.  A company near my home transports plastic containers and the only way to make a trip worthwhile is to extend the lorry and pile the containers high.  The tonnage is extremely light but the economic necessity means the containers must be piled high.  However, these oversized lorries were not catered for in the design of the tunnel, which is crazy.Local improvement schemes are a fantastic means of helping those living in isolated areas to have their lanes tarred and brought up to scratch.  Last year the money was not allocated until late in the year and my county council, for example, decided to proceed with various works because it believed the money would be available.  However, the money did not arrive and the council is being held responsible.  This is crazy because money should be allocated reasonably early in the year in order that it can be spent in a responsible way rather than rushing to find ways and means to use it in the final days of the year.  Lessons should be learned from this.  This issue should not arise every year.I refer to health issues and Monaghan General Hospital.  In his opening address to the Dáil the new Taoiseach said individuals should not get hung up on issues such as county hospitals and that we should grow up and not be naive.  I will outline the history of what has happened at Monaghan General Hospital.  A new operating theatre was built but it is only in use for a few hours five days a week.  A ward was completely refurbished before it was closed two years later and the beds put into storage.  A CAT scanner intended for the hospital is in storage.  A sum of €5 million was spent refurbishing two wards and €1.5 million on a treatment room for accidents and emergencies.  These will all be wound down or closed in the immediate future.  The newly appointed Comptroller and Auditor General will have to investigate these allocations but they are only a few examples of the misuse of taxpayer's money.  These hospitals can provide a proper service which should continue but that will not be permitted.I am frightened about how little is learned from the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mistakes are made and highlighted.  The late Deputy, Jim Mitchell, Deputy Noonan and other Chairmen of the Committee of Public Accounts have dealt with reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General but Departments have not learned.  As the previous speaker said, people move into positions in various Departments without appropriate accountancy or other skills and do not understand how things should be done.  However, no body will be shown by the new Comptroller and Auditor General to have wasted more money than the Department of Health and Children with the support of the HSE.  The previous Comptroller and Auditor General reported that a computer system was supposed to be implemented by the Department to make the health service work.  A total of €150 million was spent on it before it was dropped.  The money was totally wasted.Significant moneys have been allocated to the Department under the current Minister but cutbacks are being introduced in every area where it hurts, including services for the elderly, the disabled and others who need support.  I came across a case recently of a man living in sheltered accommodation.  The HSE sent an official who spent hours with him asking 100 questions to establish his need.  He was in receipt of home help for one hour five days a weeks at the time.  Following this discussion, this was cut to one hour a week.  A few weeks later the man fell and spent three weeks in the local hospital.  He has since spent a further two weeks in another hospital.  This is the type of management we have in the HSE.  I do not envy the Comptroller and Auditor General in his new role as he tries to evaluate the abuse and lack of effort on the part of the HSE to use the massive sum available to it.I refer to the e-voting system which the House was informed would be the be all and end all.  A sum of €55 million was wasted and the machines are lying in storage, yet they cost the taxpayer money every week and there is no prospect of them being used in the short or medium term.  This happened because appropriate research was not carried out on the system and there was no cross-party agreement.  Eventually, this was proved by an independent committee.  The money could have been well spent in dealing with issues I have raised frequently in the House.  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute.

I also thank Members for their kind remarks and contributing to the debate.  Every Member paid tribute to the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General and spoke highly of him.  I would like to be associated with their remarks in paying tribute to Mr. Purcell who has played a defining role.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has an outstanding reputation for the quality and rigour of its work.  As a former civil servant, I know that Departments will go to some lengths to avoid attracting its attention.As Deputies are aware, the effective and efficient management of resources by Departments and agencies, including greater accountability to the Oireachtas and the people for what is being achieved with public money, must be a priority for the Government, not least in the challenging financial conditions we now entering.  There is always scope to do better and achieve more efficient use of public resources.  There is no doubt that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General performs an important public service as part of a system of accountability.  It is needful to achieve the most efficient use of public resources, particularly when they have expanded, one might almost say exponentially, in the past ten years or so.A number of points were raised in the debate with which I will deal briefly.   As regards the need for a greater link between performance indicators, on the one hand, and the Estimates allocations, on the other, this issue has been raised by the OECD in its recent review of the public service, which I look forward to studying more closely.  This will be a priority in the ongoing process of budgetary and Estimates reform, building upon the significant advances and reforms of recent years, as the OECD has recognised.The new annual output statements represent a major shift in the direction of focusing on performance in delivering public service outputs; traditionally the emphasis was solely on financial inputs.  It is a matter for the relevant select committees of the Dáil to avail of these output statements to the fullest degree when considering the annual Estimates.  I note that the role of the select committees in considering the annual output statements has now been written into their orders of reference.  While it is valid to point to performance as a key consideration in assessing how the public service does its business, we should recognise that significant progress has been made in this area and that the building blocks are in place to allow for continued progress on this front into the future.A multi-annual capital investment framework was introduced in budget 2004 which allows a carryover of expenditure, not what was referred to as hurried, wasteful expenditure to keep up budgets.  The issue of multi-annual budgets for current spending is being kept under review within the Department of Finance.  Recent years have seen some far-reaching reforms.  The fundamental issue is whether these reforms should be allowed to bed in and develop further or whether there are advantages to be gained in introducing further more radical measures.Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of more transparent accountability systems.  We should work towards more transparent accountancy systems throughout the public sector, including and, perhaps, especially in the HSE and local government.  One should not have accountability systems which only experts in particularly arcane forms of accountancy are able to follow or critically judge.Deputy Fleming spoke about the lack of sufficient commercial expertise within the public sector.  This can lead to the spending of vast sums on consultancies.  This is a problem that needs to be addressed.  I sometimes wonder whether one of the problems with the PPARS project, as with many computer projects not just here but in other countries, was that people piled wish lists onto a public project that were more than it could bear.I agree with Deputy Crawford on the value of the local improvement schemes.  The Government has implemented a comprehensive value for money framework for capital expenditure.  Departments verify compliance by means of spot checks of a proportion of the capital spend each year.  As an additional control, the evaluation unit in the Department of Finance may also carry out its own checks of a small sample of projects across Departments each year.  To date the spot checks have encompassed projects in the Departments of Transport; Health and Children, including the HSE; the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Education and Science; and Arts, Sport and Tourism.  The comprehensive framework in place applies to all capital expenditure programmes, including the NDP.  NDP expenditure is also subject to ongoing programme evaluation, including a mid-term review overseen by the central expenditure evaluation unit.  Two such programme evaluations have commenced.  One is an evaluation of local and community development programmes, while the other is an evaluation of the science, technology and innovation programme.  The findings of all NDP programme evaluations will be published and submitted to the relevant Oireachtas select committees.The value for money and policy reviews form an important part of a broader approach to move resource allocation away from a narrow focus on financial inputs to a broader consideration of performance and the delivery of outputs and outcomes.  A total of 82 of the 91 reviews scheduled for the 2006-08 round of reviews have either been completed or are under way.  Of these, 54 have been completed or are almost complete, with 37 fully completed.  This represents significant progress, given that there are almost eight months remaining of the 30 during which the reviews were scheduled to be completed.  The then Tánaiste and Minister for Finance introduced the requirement that reviews should be published and presented to the relevant select committee of the Oireachtas in order to facilitate greater engagement with the process by the Oireachtas and its select committees and to further enhance the impact of reviews.  In this regard, he wrote to the Chairmen of the select committees in February to encourage them to ensure time was scheduled to consider the reviews in detail and, where appropriate, to discuss them and their conclusions and recommendations with relevant Departments.As Members have mentioned, it is particularly important that the Comptroller and Auditor General is independent.  In addition to supporting the Oireachtas in holding the Government to account, his office contributes to the public service through objective reporting, on the basis of which the Committee of Public Accounts can make recommendations to improve the management of public services.  The constraint on the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in commenting on Government policy is crucial to the independence of the office and the cycle of accountability for public moneys.  While the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General may touch on issues the subject of public controversy, the independence of his office and accountability requirements demand that policy be the preserve of the Government and that the relationship between the Department of Finance and the Committee of Public Accounts be characterised by co-operation in accounting for the efficient use of public funds and the effectiveness of management systems in the public sector.I wish Mr. Purcell a happy and active retirement.  I also wish the incoming Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Buckley, every success.Cuireadh agus aontaíodh an cheist.

I wish to share time with Deputies Higgins and Ó Caoláin.  I congratulate my constituency colleague on his appointment as Minister for Finance, although I confess I am disappointed he is not available to be here in the Chamber for this first debate on the economy for the new Government.  On a personal level, I wish him well and obviously any constituency would love one of its TDs to be Minister for Finance and Dublin West is no exception.The House devotes far too few hours to economic matters.  We are thankfully coming to the point when policy makers are, however belatedly, responding to repeated wake-up calls from home and abroad about the state of the economy.  It is true our economy has many strong points built up by workers, business people and the public sector.  We have a young, educated and hard-working workforce.  We have a can-do entrepreneurial spirit in this country that has served us well in the past and which will serve us well again in the future.We must stimulate innovative indigenous entrepreneurship.  We can and must re-orientate our economy towards high-tech, high-value-added activity.  We must invest in the infrastructure of education and public transport we need to support this vision of the knowledge society.This Government has been in denial about the impact of the economic downturn on tens of thousands of people across this country.  But the thousands who are losing their jobs, the businesses that are finding the going rough and the home buyers in negative equity know how difficult is the current situation.  Already this year, we have seen the largest monthly increase in the live register since 1967 while 1,600 people are losing their jobs every week and this has happened on Deputy Cowen's watch.  Economic growth is at its lowest level since 1988.  The cost of living is increasing at 4.3%, and three times the rate the Government inherited in 1997.  This is happening on Deputy Cowen's watch.  The ESRI consumer confidence index is at its lowest level since the index was first introduced.  Retail sales are falling for the first time since 2004 and on Deputy Cowen's watch.  The CSO construction employment index is down by 11% in the past 12 months.  Cuts in hospital budgets being imposed this year are, in real terms, the most severe since 1988, all on Deputy Cowen's watch.Four months into the year and the budgetary arithmetic is already under severe strain, as tax revenues have come in €736 million below target, down 6.5% on the same period last year, even when inflation was running at nearly 5% for the year.  The Minister for Finance is praying he will be rescued later in the year when corporation tax and income tax from the self-employed is due.If we extrapolate the latest Exchequer figures for the full year, we could see tax revenue coming in much lower than the target of nearly €49 billion, the revised downward target which Deputy Cowen set on budget day.  Such is the deterioration in the Government's financial position that the Maastricht criteria now loom on the horizon as a further discipline in 2009.  Who would have imagined this as Deputy Brian Cowen promised the world in the run-up to the general election?  We need to see revised economic projections.  I call on the new Minister for Finance to publish revised projections, both for the tax take and for expenditure, as soon as possible.We have already witnessed from Fianna Fáil and the Government the five typical phases involved when a shock or a bereavement occurs.  These are denial, bluster, bargaining, depression, and finally, reluctant acceptance.  If a week is a long time in politics, then for this Government the denial phase lasted an eternity.  Ministers, led by Deputy Cowen, buried their heads in the sand and pretended the problems would go away.  They had a bad collective case of ostrich syndrome.  I am sure many Deputies have read Charles Dickens's novel, David Copperfield.  One of its characters is a loquacious character named Mr. Micawber, a man who owed much, and who earned less.  He was always certain that, “something will turn up”.  For the past year, Deputy Cowen has been more Micawberish than Dickens ever imagined.After denial comes bluster.  Fianna Fáil Ministers are like the New Orleans officials who denied there was anything wrong after Hurricane Katrina, until the water was up to their necks.  These Ministers confidently predicted a soft landing and derided realists for talking down the economy.  Bertie Ahern famously suggested that all the doomsayers should just go and top themselves.Now they are telling us that the worst is over.  Present events, they say, are no more than a necessary correction to an overheated market.  They tell us there has never been a better time to buy, and so on and so on, in even more desperate tones.  They tell us that all will be well in 2009 if only people would stop worrying.  They seem to be waiting in hope for the Celtic tiger's third coming.This Government was happy enough to ride the crest of an economic wave for a decade, taking all the credit when things were going well but are only able to point fingers when things go pear shaped.  They create excuses in their heads as to why something is happening.  There is always someone else to blame, never themselves.  This is what is happening at the moment, but it does not wash.  Psychiatrists could write a whole book on the way Ministers have reacted to the events of the past year.  Now the truth can no longer be avoided.  From the coal face, the redoubtable Owen O'Callaghan warns, "There will be blood".  This is a hard lesson in economics for the many Fianna Fáil slow learners even if his choice of words is hardly very original.  We all know how that film ended.  Greed drove away everything that was dear to the Daniel Day-Lewis character.Profit margins in the construction industry are down from 33% to 20%.  There will be blood indeed.  Let us hope it is the speculators who lose out, not the decent building firms and construction workers working in the industry for the long term.To his credit, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, recently proposed the introduction of windfall charges on speculative land purchases.  This would strike the average person as a common-sense proposal.  However, Deputy Cowen was not having that and he slapped down the proposal.  He also refused to close the section 110 loophole used by property developers to avoid stamp duty and it is clear his priorities have not changed.All economists forecast that things are on the downturn and all this happened on Deputy Cowen's watch as Minister for Finance.We have a housing slump.  Owen O'Callaghan has let the cat out of the bag, advising people to hold off buying for a while yet, so it appears we are not out of the woods.  Thousands of people who bought houses on 100% mortgages over the past year are in negative equity.  The first tremors in the housing market were seen when the Government fuelled speculation about stamp duty reform.  We then saw not one bout of reform but two, a stark admission that the ill-thought out reform had been botched the first time around.  In any asset market, the worst possible course of action is to introduce uncertainty.  This is one part of the problem.  Another part of the problem is that property development was treated by Government as a speculative get rich quick scheme, particularly the land speculation part of it.  They pump-primed the housing market, egging on people to pay more and more for homes.  They fuelled the hysteria about the race to get on the property ladder.  It was a get rich quick scheme all right, for all the property developers who gather for their annual love-in at the Galway races tent.  The people set to lose out are the thousands of mainly young people and families who are now faced with negative equity and years of worry and uncertainty.  Soaring house prices boosted consumer confidence, consumer spending and the broader economy on the way up.  We are reaping a bitter harvest for the Government's short sighted concentration on a purely bricks and mortar economy rather than more balanced economic development.Falling house prices have seriously undermined consumer confidence, now at its lowest in a decade and still falling.  This has hit consumer spending, particularly on big-ticket items like cars and household goods.  Recently we saw the effect this is having, for example, with the closure of Habitat stores.The fall-off in house building is not only leading to job losses in the construction sector, but to job losses across the wider economy.  We have job losses on a scale that most young people have never witnessed and are an unhappy distant memory for everyone else.  We see job losses all around the country and in all sectors, even in the previously robust financial services sector.These cold realities are beginning to strike home and it is not a pleasant sight.  People are beginning to feel the pinch and to tighten their belts accordingly.  Yet, faced with this scale of crisis the Government has flinched from its obligations and has refused to take corrective action for entirely political reasons to do with the recent upheavals in Fianna Fáil.  While the rest of the country was worrying about the economy, Fianna Fáil was worrying about the succession and taking its eye off the ball.I worry about higher food prices.  The price of flour is up 40% in the past year and milk is up 30%.  That affects every family and less well-off families more than others.  Those on low, fixed incomes and on social welfare find it more and more difficult to put dinner on the table.  The Government should show leadership by considering whether its own salaries deserve to jump by up to €38,000 per year, more than many earn in a year.People are worried about the price of fuel.  It is costing more to fill the tank with petrol, the tractor with diesel and the central heating with oil.  Not only are people spending longer stuck in traffic burning fuel, but it is costing them a packet.  Fuel poverty is becoming more of a concern.  Increases in fuel allowances have not kept pace with fuel inflation.  Yesterday, we heard about the proposed increases in fuel prices by the ESB and Bord Gáis.  It is the poor who will take the hardest hit.When the currency is strong, one expects to see a dip in inflation, yet Irish inflation remains stubbornly above the eurozone average.  At a time when our exporters are taking a hit from the weaker dollar and weaker sterling, our consumers are still faced with higher prices.  It has become clear that many retailers are not passing on the benefits of cheaper imports to their consumers.  In many British high-street chains the full extent of this rip-off is evident.  Prices are often marked in sterling and euro side by side.  This makes transparent just how out of kilter are the exchange rates being used.  The remedy for many consumers is obvious.  They go up the road, 90 miles to Belfast, spend their money there, convert to sterling and get much better value.  That is what people from the North used to do when our economy offered value.  Why should people from the South not do it in reverse?The National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority have key roles to play.  The Government must direct these agencies to be more aggressive in protecting consumers from predatory pricing and rip off.  They must insist that all goods are priced in euro, to actively monitor pricing policies and exchange rates to ensure fair play for consumers and to protect against rip-offs.When Labour last left Government, we were creating 1,000 jobs a week.  According to the live register, 1,600 more people lose their jobs every week.  This year we have already seen the largest month-on-month jump in the live register since 1967.  This is the legacy the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, has left to the new Minister for Finance.  The question is what the Minister will do about it.Priority number one for the new Government seems to be public sector reform.  I think all Members agree we need a more effective, efficient and citizen centred public service.  Priority number one for any Government, however, must surely be to get the country working.Our economy and our public finances became too dependent on house building as a direct result of Government policies.  It was not sustainable that we were building nearly as many houses as the UK every year in a country only a tenth of the size.  The question facing the country is what to do now.  The Labour Party has a number of proposals to make.  The Government may not like them all but we expect the Government to come up with some of its own proposals.As an absolute priority we need to implement a programme of education, training and reskilling for all those coming out of the construction and manufacturing sector who have lost their jobs.  Many young men, in particular, are at risk of falling into the unemployment trap if clear pathways are not outlined for them to acquire transferable skills.  There must be a significant focus on retraining and educational opportunities for such workers.  We want to see some of those workers getting a chance to go to university and compete for the high end jobs where there are vacancies particularly among some of the multinationals here.  In fact, we should be ambitious that the people who have worked hard in the construction industry and in manufacturing have genuine alternatives to which to go.An area that will become increasingly in vogue over the coming months and years is the so-called "green-collar" jobs, namely, improving the environmental standards of existing buildings, retrofitting and installing insulation and other energy efficient measures.  This is another area where, particularly if the Government oriented some reliefs and incentives towards home owners, houses could be brought up to standard and made more energy efficient.  In the process, as with Denmark, we could create much good quality employment from going green.For years, there has been serious under investment in the Irish education sector, particularly on the capital side.  It is testament to the quality of the teachers that our education outcomes are so good.  From Donegal to Wexford and from Dublin West to Kerry South there are schools in serious states of dilapidation.  We hear of children having to take classes in converted toilets and the like.  This in a country which purports to have a knowledge economy.We have an opportunity to end this disgrace and use the spare capacity in the construction sector to build schools to a standard of which we can be proud.  With the current fall in the construction sector, the Government should be able to get better value for money through the tendering process in building and refurbishing schools.This is an area where the Labour Party calls for the front-loading of national development plan expenditure for immediate investment in building and refurbishing our schools.  Not only would this provide work for many people coming out of the house-building sector with the right skills, it would also help our education system by ensuring adequate capital investment.Another measure which could have an immediate impact here is the restoration of the summer works scheme.  These are not the long-term answers, but they would help smooth the transition to a more broadly balanced economy.  Investment in education is imperative.  It will be the foundation of our knowledge economy and of the opportunities for future generations.At the weekend I saw that all the profiles of the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance celebrated the fact that he is a Cambridge man.  I am sure the Minister of State in his Cambridge days enjoyed a pleasant punt on the Cann River.  On a day trip to Cambridge, as a tourist, I recall seeing the people from Cambridge punting on the river.  I saw many punters spend their time going around in circles and some going backwards.  Punting can be fun and I am sure it is not as easy as it appears.  It is not preparation for navigating the stormy seas surrounding the economy.  The sea around us may be choppy but those on the Government benches who are in charge of the economy carry on as if they were at a summer picnic.  That is not good enough, the country deserves better.Over the period of the Celtic tiger we built an economy, of which we can all be proud, on the backs of the work of our people, including business people and public servants.  It is a pity to see so much of that effort going down the drain on the watch of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I am pleased to have an opportunity of saying a few words on this motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton.  It is deeply disappointing that so few Deputies from the Government side are present to debate our options as the economy reaches a turning point.  In recent years, one of the most depressing aspects of discussion of the economy was listening to Ministers making statements in the House that were akin to hearing yesterday's rather than tomorrow's weather.  Having reeled off gross figures of expenditure across various headings, their statements were regurgitated for backbench Government Deputies.Many of those observing the economy are deeply anxious about the future and seek an economic debate.  They are badly served by the media which do not comment on the economy but indulge in a type of forecasting of how bad the position will be.  Thus one reads or hears what I describe as populist effusions which have nothing to do with economics.  For example, we have discussions in which bookmakers refer to "breakfast roll man" at a time when serious issues need to be discussed.I will use the few minutes available to me to raise some of these issues.  It is time we spoke directly.  The country is about to pay a horrific price for the close connection between the speculative section of the building industry and Fianna Fáil, the major Government party.  The people who are skilled at building houses and know about space and costs and how to place one brick on top of another did not inform Fianna Fáil Party's policy on housing.  Instead, on every occasion and in every budget more and more resources were made available to create almost a tax-free run at generating speculative wealth.  The invitation from the republican party was not to be ambitious for the Republic or people in general but for oneself.  Thus, conversations revolved around whether people had got a piece of this or that action.  That is what one heard as people ate and drank more and indulged in a sea of excess.As we approach the end of our longest period of economic growth, few commentators are able to make the elementary contrast between the five years of growth between 1995 and 2000 based on manufacturing exports and the five year period thereafter.  The elementary feature of growth based on manufacturing exports is that goods must be made to be sold in a process that creates jobs.  Economic growth during the period from 2000 to 2005, on the other hand, was based on the revaluation of the property base.  Those who gain in that circumstance are those who have been speculating madly in a tax free environment for speculation.Before the previous general election, the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties engaged in blackmail, telling voters they were the parties which had provided the jobs carrying hods and applying plaster.  The expense of the houses built did not matter, nor did whether nurses, gardaí and those on average incomes were forced to live miles from their workplaces.  That is the madness that occurred and those are the unsavoury connections which were responsible for it.  Dr. Bacon produced three reports but the Government threw away those it did not want, simply because they did not suit the speculative clique funding the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties.We must consider the role of the social economy as we enter into a threatening period with the second lowest level of protection in the European Union.  The commentators and Government fellow travellers could not see the contradiction between claiming to be the second richest country in Europe or the world and having the second lowest level of social protection.  Thus the most vulnerable are at the bottom of the pile and have been joined by those who have been made insecure owing to high mortgage repayments.  The banking system, which colluded with this speculative racket that ran through Government policy, is threatening all sorts of people as it seeks repayments of loans.I heard one of the most pessimistic forecasters among Irish economists assert that the engine of growth, the building industry, has disappeared and there is nothing to replace it.  Deputy Burton outlined some areas in which replacements could be found.  For example, a Government which took responsibility for politics would engage in debate on how to use capital expenditure under the national development plan to provide for the infrastructural needs of the social economy.  Deputy Burton cited other examples, including schools.We need jobs in the caring economy.  In most versions of the social economy, one spends money in health not only to cure people but also to care for them to ensure they do not need high levels of expenditure on illness.  Instead of a health strategy, the Government has offered an illness industry.  There are many actions we can take, even with our low and threatened base, to turn the situation around.  We must invest in infrastructure and devise strategies to ensure skills are upgraded rather than lost and new opportunities are created in other forms of the economy.  We have had neither an analysis nor a policy.  It is a disgrace that so many people are interested in publishing gossip about the economy rather than continuing the hard work of economic analysis done since the time of Lord Keynes.I am pleased to note Government representation in the House has doubled with the arrival of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who will be aware of the contribution made by Lord Keynes.  Politicians are elected to offer economic options and discuss, debate and choose between options for the connection between the economy and society.  This debate is absent.  Instead, we have a shabby betrayal of a republic.  The alternative, which would come from a social economy, would be an inclusive republic with an equality of citizenship.  What we got was bits and pieces with speculative ghosts haunting the Government in power.  Occasionally the previous Taoiseach suggested that people volunteer for social purposes some of the shrinking time left to them in a country with the longest commuting journeys in Europe.We can create jobs in many areas, not only in immediate transfer to the capital programme, the caring society and the great opportunities available in green industries, of which the Scandinavian countries have availed.  The connection between society and politics is at the heart of democracy and a social guarantee must be given in health, education and elsewhere that there is a level below which people will not be allowed to sink.  Such a guarantee is not available and thus one has the crude measure under which, for example, the Department of Health and Children has asked the Health Service Executive to recover €100 million, irrespective of from where it secures it.  Thus right across the budgets, people will be threatened for such elementary things as home help.  Do the republicans stand over the cuts in home help and the removal of respite care?  Do the republicans say that people in this great developed republic, the second richest in the world, are not entitled to the most minimal care in their old age?People should ask how they did in the great times when all became so rich.  Who should people trust now when the guff is flying all around the place for the strategy which will enable us to simply survive?  More important, people should vote for a politics which is republican, inclusive and based on equality.  They should lay the foundations for the social economy and support a politics that will build it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of this Labour Party Private Members' motion.  There is very real and justifiable concern about implications of the poor performance of important economic indicators.  However, we need to be realistic about the slowdown we are experiencing and pragmatic about what can be done to sustain the economy in these turbulent times as well as rejuvenate it for the future.  What we need is action from the Government.  We need to see hands-on economic management from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.In recent years, the Government and the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, adopted what can only be described as a hands-off approach to managing the economy.  No effort was made to put the economy on a sustainable footing.  It was allowed to become grossly over dependent on the construction sector.  For the past five years, growth has been driven by domestic consumption rather than exports and nothing was done to address this unsustainable situation.  The Exchequer was allowed to become too dependent on tax both from construction and consumption.  It is no wonder then that tax revenues have fallen sharply over recent months.  The Government was warned about this very outcome, yet it persisted with proposing and implementing further tax cuts, including the reduction in the higher rate of income tax from 42% to 41%.While the Government had the benefit of the largest Exchequer surpluses ever experienced, it failed to use them efficiently and effectively to improve capacity and quality in our public services.  It failed to prepare for the inevitable slowdown in the construction sector.  It did not deliver on time and on budget a fast, modern public transport system.  It has left us as the poor relation in Europe when it comes to broadband provision and IT infrastructure.  These failures have had serious consequences for competitiveness.The increases in the cost of living are now hitting home for many for many families.  Price levels are much higher than in every other European country bar Denmark, averaging at 23% for consumer services and 14% for consumer goods.  Inflation is projected to remain high in 2008 and 2009.Those on low and average income have come under particular pressure over recent years.  The pay increases agreed under the last social partnership agreement Towards 2016 were outpaced by inflation.  Workers are faced with increasing prices in essentials, such as food and fuel, while mortgage interest rates have also gone up significantly.  The rise in food prices is a major concern for those on low incomes.  While the average household spends one eighth of its income on food for lower wage earners, it can be as high as one quarter.  Demands for wage moderation from these workers demonstrates a clear lack of understanding about the pressure they already face.The Government needs to play a role in curbing inflationary pressures by greatly improving public services for workers starting with ending the need for private health insurance by providing a decent public health care service, by providing cheap and efficient public transport and by properly funding schools to take the pressure off hard pressed parents to raise funds for their children's school building needs.The state of the public finances in the face of declining tax revenue is a real concern.  It is important the Government acts responsibly to ensure that revenue is adequate to meet spending demands in the time ahead.  Proposals for further tax cuts should be immediately dropped.  In addition, as the social insurance fund comes under increasing pressure as the numbers of unemployed increase, plans to slash PRSI contribution rates must also be dropped.  The Government must close all tax loopholes, including all those enjoyed by property developers.The Government's greatest mistake over the past six to 12 months has been its total failure to act to protect those at risk of losing their jobs or to ensure increased participation in training and upskilling by vulnerable workers.  It has sat back and done nothing as workers face the prospect of unemployment.  No action was taken to protect the jobs of those in the construction sector.  This could yet be done by embarking on a social construction programme to deliver the 70,000 social houses needed to clear the social housing list.There needs to be a focus on building a sustainable economy.  We should also begin to focus on indigenous enterprise as a means of creating and sustaining jobs in Ireland.  Multinationals bring investment and it is welcome but they have no loyalty to Ireland and are always looking for the next country lower down the scale in wages and entitlements.  That has been demonstrated month after month in recent years.  We cannot compete in that kind of market anymore.  We must attract foreign direct investment because we have the skills base suitable and we must create our own enterprise capable of competing on the international market.It is apparent that Irish firms are struggling to remain competitive as the economy slows.  It is important to note that labour costs are only one aspect of the competitiveness debate and that the cost of employing a worker in Ireland is the 22nd lowest of the 30 richest countries in the world.  Our overall level of productivity is high, the fourth highest in the industrial world, but it can be improved.  More investment in skills, transport and communications infrastructure and public services are key.Ultimately, Irish firms have much to offer the international market but we need to ensure that all relevant business bodies and the Government are working in harmony to encourage, promote and market Irish business both at home and abroad.The response of the Government in its amendment to the motion will not reassure those of us in the Opposition that it is serious about tacking the economic challenges about which I spoke.  While commending itself on the state of the public finances, it gives us no indication of what it plans to do to ensure public finances are adequate to meet spending demands in the years ahead.  Unsurprisingly, it does not mention the fact €927 million or 6.5% less in tax revenue was collected during the first four months of 2008 than in 2007.  There is no indication as to whether the Government plans to drop its untenable plans to cut tax.  In fact, the amendment gives the clear impression that the Government does not adequately comprehend the extent of the economic challenge we face either in terms of competitiveness or the pressure on workers in vulnerable sectors and the low paid.What we need from the Government is a change in its approach to the management of the economy that would see a hands-on approach to managing same.  We need to see real action to increase the numbers of workers being retrained and upskilled to allow them to access alternative employment should they lose their jobs.  We need to see concrete action to improve competitiveness and support the development of indigenous enterprises.  I happily declare my support for the Labour Party motion and oppose the Government amendment.

I welcome especially the opportunity to set out clearly the record of the Government on the management of the economy and the public finances and to outline the prospects for the Irish economy in the short to medium terms.  I welcome the subject put forward for discussion by the Labour Party and thank Deputy Higgins for his good wishes.Over the past decade or so, we have witnessed unparalleled levels of economic success and prosperity.  Ireland is now an international showcase of how a country's economic landscape can be transformed when the appropriate Government policies are coupled with stakeholder involvement, through social partnership.  Since 1997, the rate of economic growth in Ireland has averaged 7.25% per annum.  This strong rate of expansion has brought average incomes per head in Ireland, not just up to, but above those prevailing in most other advanced countries.  Over this period the total number at work has risen by some 700,000, resulting in a fall in the unemployment rate from some 10% to about 5.5% now, although for the most of the past few years it was in the region of 4.5%.  If we consider the situation 21 years ago, employment has doubled since then from just over 1 million to over 2 million, an enormous achievement.  Involuntary emigration has been eliminated and Ireland is now a destination country for migrants, with non-Irish nationals amounting to almost one in every six in the labour force.Over the past year or so, the economic environment has clearly become more challenging and the outlook less benign and more uncertain.  This reflects a combination of both international and domestic factors.  As a small and open economy, global economic developments play a key role in shaping Ireland's economic horizon.The Irish economy is highly integrated into the global economy.  In this context, therefore, the slower growth anticipated this year for our main trading partners, the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom, will have an unavoidably negative impact upon our prospects.  The difficulties in the United States stem mainly from the housing market and particularly from the sub-prime mortgage segment of that market.  These developments have impaired the functioning of international credit markets and, it is fair to say, the problems have persisted longer than had been initially expected.  Given the openness of our economy, recent exchange rate developments are also unhelpful with the euro appreciating against the dollar and, more recently, sterling.On the domestic front, the residential construction sector grew in importance in recent years.  For instance, roughly one third of the housing stock was built within the past decade.  As recently as 2006, we were producing over 88,000 units on an annual basis and last year we produced 78,000 units.  Given our rate of population growth, this rate of output was excessive and an adjustment towards more sustainable levels of output in new house construction was inevitable.  At this stage, it is too early to say with certainty what the level of housing output will be for this year, with most commentators now saying it will be in the 40,000 to 50,000 range, but in any event, housing will exert a negative drag on economic growth.  Also, it is not certain how long it will be before the medium-term sustainable level of activity is achieved.  Where there is an inevitable and natural adjustment, there is no point in trying to behave like King Canute and trying to hold back the tide.Another unwelcome economic trend over the past year or so has been an increase in the rate of inflation.  This too, has largely been the result of external factors, over which we have little control.  For instance, the wholesale price of oil rose to over $120 per barrel recently, while some food prices have reached all-time highs in recent months.  It is worth pointing out, however, that the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, moderated in April, down to 4.3% from 5% in March.  The general view is that a further easing is in prospect during the second half of the year.  It is well to remember that in the domestic context we use a measure which registers higher than measures used in the European context.  The stronger exchange rate and easing of domestic demand should lead to a further moderation in the rate as the year progresses.  I expect that, over time, the stronger exchange rate should lead to a decline in import prices, especially for products such as food.  On an EU harmonised basis, Irish inflation was 3.3% in April, in line with that in the euro area.  In other words, real earnings in other advanced countries are also being affected by global commodity price developments.  I propose to refer to the national pay talks later but it is important to make the point that it would be futile to try to compensate ourselves through wage increases for the fall in the terms of trade which these externally-generated price increases represent.On a more positive note, I am happy to be able to say with confidence that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong.  This will help us to absorb the housing adjustment and external shocks so our medium-term prospects should continue to be favourable.  Among the pillars of this strength are that public finances are sound with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area, especially if one takes the net rather than gross figure; our markets are flexible, allowing us to respond efficiently to adverse developments; we have a dynamic and well-educated labour force; we have a pro-business outward-looking society; and the tax burden on both labour and capital is low.  Not many countries anywhere in the world are facing the current global economic difficulties with such advantages.On another positive note, the Government is giving priority to full implementation of the national development plan and provision for an increase in capital spending of around 12% this year has been made.  In the short term, this will help to absorb some of the slack emerging from the new house building sector.  Throughout the length and breadth of Ireland people are seeing real progress in terms of our infrastructure as the benefits are clearly there.  Whether one lives in the greater Dublin area or further afield everybody is conscious, particularly those undertaking medium and long-distance journeys, of the major improvements in road and public transport.  There is much more in the pipeline and as it comes through it is achieving major improvements.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	253	There is no denying that our fiscal position has weakened from that envisaged at budget time with tax revenue some €736 million behind what was expected at the end of April.  However, it is important to note that income tax and corporation tax are broadly in line with expectations and, as such, are good indicators of the economy.  It is important, however, to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances which I have already mentioned.  It is also important to stress that, despite the underlying strength of the public finances, the Government is determined there will be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy.  This implies that it is crucial for Government Departments to adhere to the significant levels of current day-to-day expenditure provided for their activities this year.As pointed out by the Minister for Finance in budget 2008, we must get back to lower single digit increases in current spending as quickly and as prudently as possible, particularly if we are to maintain capital investment as set out in the national development plan.  The Minister for Finance said: "A measured deceleration is required, not a sudden slamming of brakes, especially when we are entering a period of below-trend growth by Irish standards."  Over the past few months we have managed to avoid shocks to the economy imparted by Government tightening that would have had to take place in previous times but that we have created the latitude to avoid on this occasion.The Government's priorities are clear and straightforward.  They are to protect the weaker in society through maintaining a high level of social spending; deliver better and more effective public services; seek value for money at all levels of public spending; and continue to invest heavily in public infrastructure.  While the increased expenditure of recent years, facilitated by corresponding economic growth, has brought many positive benefits we are now entering a period of lower economic growth.  Therefore, to avoid unnecessary debt and continue to afford the massive capital investment, it is vital for all our futures that we maintain the basic correspondence between the growth in spending and the growth in our resources.Despite the constraints imposed by slower economic growth, the Government's priorities for current spending remain health, education and social welfare which account for almost 80% of total current spending.  The Government is aware that achieving its objectives in these areas is not simply a matter of injecting larger amounts of resources into them.  A key challenge, therefore, for Government now and for the future is to ensure desired outcomes are achieved across the public service with optimum efficiency in terms of resources.The process of public service reform has been under way for over a decade.  It has not been piecemeal and any objective analysis would conclude that the public service has come a long way since the strategic management initiative was launched.  During that time our public services have been expanded, improved and reformed.  There have been significant improvements in the areas of financial management, human resources management, regulatory reform, e-Government initiatives and customer service delivery.The implementation of the modernisation agenda continues to be driven by the various partnership agreements across the public service.  The current partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives as well as improvements in productivity right across the public service.  It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on the achievements of previous agreements.  The Government is committed to developing the modernisation agenda through the partnership process.While there is no doubt that significant progress has been made in the past decade or so in modernising the public service, we must also acknowledge that many more changes are awaited and needed.  That is why the Government asked the OECD to undertake a review of the Irish public service.  The report of this review was published recently and it acknowledges the central role played by the public service in contributing to an economic success story that many OECD countries would like to emulate.  It states we are on a sound trajectory of modernisation but that we could further improve the yield from reforms by renewing focus on their pace and sequencing to make them more mutually reinforcing.  The review marks an important step in the ongoing modernisation of the Irish public service.  The Taoiseach will shortly announce the appointment of a task force on public service reform to report to the Government with a comprehensive programme for action.In their motion which they put down for debate tonight, the Labour Deputies call for various actions to be taken by the Government to address what they call the economic downturn.  While I do not propose to outline all of the Government's policies to address the economic difficulties that we face in the short term, I should comment on some of those which are relevant to what these Deputies have asked the Government to do.On the call for a substantial programme of school building, the Government is already providing for a very substantial school building programme which is aimed at continuing to modernise the stock of school accommodation while targeting the needs of communities that are experiencing rapid demographic changes.  Under the new national development plan, funding of €4.5 billion has been allocated for this purpose over the lifetime of the plan.  This represents the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State.  It is expected to provide 45,000 additional permanent school places in new primary schools and 22,500 additional permanent new places in post-primary schools, together with additional permanent school places and enhanced facilities in existing primary schools. benefiting 40,000 pupils and 60,000 pupils in existing post-primary schools.These projects, when taken with a number of other projects in developing areas involving extensions to existing schools, will provide approximately 7,500 additional school places for September 2008.  In addition, construction is due to commence in 2008 on the first bundle of schools to be procured under public private partnership arrangements as part of the Government's new expanded PPP programme.The Government is strongly committed to supporting investment in high-tech and high-risk ventures.  Two years ago the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched the seed and venture capital scheme for 2007-12 specifically to address the problem of a lack of early stage finance in the market for innovative start-up firms.  Investment by Enterprise Ireland in this scheme is a vital contributor to the development of a more robust, commercially viable and sustainable seed and venture capital industry in Ireland.The Government's commitment to encouraging investment by giving tax concessions to entrepreneurs is also shown by the renewal again of the business expansion scheme, BES, and of the associated seed capital scheme, SCS.  Following an extensive review of the schemes in 2006, the Finance Act 2007 extended the schemes to 31 December 2013 and increased the aggregate amount that a company can raise under the schemes from €1 million to €2 million.  The individual investment limits were increased from €31,750 to €150,000 in the case of the BES and to €100,000 in the case of the SCS.  As the schemes are State aids, these changes required that an application be made to the European Commission for approval.  This approval was received in August 2007 and a commencement order giving effect to the changes was signed by the Minister for Finance in the following month.On housing, the Government is committed to investing €18 billion in housing programmes through the national development plan, with €2.5 billion being allocated to our wide range of housing programmes during 2008.  The supply of affordable housing from these schemes has consistently increased in the past few years from approximately 2,000 units in 2004 to almost 3,600 units last year and further expansion is envisaged under the national development plan in line with Towards 2016 commitments.  To underpin this expansion, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government asked the Affordable Homes Partnership to consider how to enhance the range of existing affordable housing mechanisms.The resulting report, entitled Increasing Affordable Housing Supply, has been published.  The report's recommendations are based on optimising the output from the existing mechanisms and include a proposal to introduce a new affordable housing product based on an equity loan arrangement to be used in conjunction with the existing schemes.  A public consultation on this report was launched recently and will be concluded within a few weeks.  There will also be structured engagement with the social partners, housing practitioners and financiers on this report.  These consultations will address, inter alia, views on the proposed new product, the targeting of affordable housing and the need for affordable renting, and the results of the consultation will inform the further development of affordable housing policy.In addition, the housing miscellaneous provisions Bill, which is expected to be published during the present Dáil session, will include provisions to give effect to the incremental purchase scheme which was signalled in the housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.  This scheme will be targeted at households with an income lower than that required for affordable housing.  Arrangements are also being considered for the piloting of the proposed scheme in certain areas.As regards the call for a major programme of training and reskilling of those losing their jobs in manufacturing and construction, Deputies will be aware that FÁS, the national training and employment authority, has a specific policy in place to deal with redundancies and company closures.  It offers a tailored approach as early as possible to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment.  This applies to workers in all sectors, including construction.  FÁS also has a fast-track redundancy notification system in place with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that a speedy and appropriate response is provided for redundant workers.FÁS is developing a strategy in response to the current slowdown in the construction sector and any anticipated future redundancies.  This strategy will contain a number of initiatives and measures such as working in close collaboration with the Construction Industry Federation and other key stakeholders to encourage redundant construction workers to seek retraining in skills that are in short supply in the economy.  I want to point out that FÁS actively engages with the unemployed after three months on the live register to assist them progress towards employment, training or active labour market programmes.  FÁS also places particular emphasis on the training of low-skilled workers in vulnerable industries to ensure that in the event of becoming unemployed, they will have the skills necessary to make the transition to other employment.In the past two decades social partnership has played a key role in delivering real economic and social benefits.  The concept of social partnership is consistent and compatible with the republicanism invoked by Deputy Higgins.  Among the core strengths of social partnership, which arises from the involvement of the key stakeholders in our economy in the process, is a clear shared sense of the economic difficulties that are emerging and an associated strong sense of realism regarding the nature of the competitive challenge for Ireland.  This realism is needed now more than ever to ensure that competitiveness is restored so that the focus of economic activity can be successfully moved away from residential construction towards export-led growth.In this context the Government is aware of the crucial importance to the economy of a successful outcome of the national pay talks which have recently begun.  The Government has shown leadership by making a decision to defer the increases recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector for Ministers and Ministers of State.  Pay developments in the period immediately ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and must be accompanied by improvements in productivity, not just in the private sector but across all parts of the public service.Achieving a national pay deal that supports competitiveness gains in a globalised economy will be a key element in enabling our economy to ride out any storm.  We know that our economy is flexible and that we have overcome difficulties before.  At the time of the bursting of the dot.com bubble at the beginning of the decade there were fears that it would have a serious impact on the economy, but that did not happen because the economy proved itself to be resilient and emerged with renewed vigour.  While the outlook for the short term is not favourable, we can face it from a position of strength.I am delighted to have had the opportunity to remind the House of the record of substantial achievement in the management of the economy by successive Governments in the past ten years, even in the past 21 years.  I am also delighted to have had the opportunity to present to the House a realistic assessment of the present state of the economy and of its future prospects.  The Government knows that over the short term it faces new difficulties and constraints.  However, it is well equipped to overcome these problems because it has ensured that the public finances are sound and it has identified the priorities to secure future growth while at the same time protecting the weaker in society and deliver on its objectives in these tougher times.  Moreover, it has the competence and experience in implementing the correct policies.The period of high growth that has recently ended began in 1993-94 under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  It was sustained by the rainbow Government and it continued through until 2007.

None of us had the hubris to believe that the economic cycle would be abolished.  Sooner or later, we were bound to encounter factors leading to a downturn.Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke of the multinational companies in a somewhat deprecating manner.  Many of the multinationals in this country have shown a very substantial commitment over quite a long period.  It is wrong to depict them as fly by night in nature.  Large indigenous firms do not necessarily behave in a radically different manner.  An opinion was also expressed that we cannot compete.  It is interesting that the headquarters of a number of firms in London have either decided to move or have contemplated moving to Dublin.Fianna Fáil has shown a substantial commitment to social republicanism in its management of the economy.  For example, close to 40% of the workforce do not pay tax.  The European Commission has often stated that we have the most favourable tax system for low paid workers.  When he was Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach brought a markedly more egalitarian ethos to the management of the public finances and to welfare improvements.  Any tax plans were always conditional on economic circumstances, and the same would have been true if the Opposition parties were elected to Government.  The Taoiseach made it clear that the priority now is to sustain public service and employment, and to make sure that the economy and society come through current difficulties with the minimum of damage.As was stated during the previous debate on the Comptroller and Auditor General, the emphasis must be on improved value for money.  There have been very substantial increases under every spending head over the past few years.  We must ensure we get a better bang for our buck.  Therefore, I commend the Government amendment to the House.

He spoke about a 7.5% rate of economic growth since 1997, but he neglected to mention that it will be as low as 1.6% for 2008.  He neglected to mention that when the new Taoiseach became Minister for Finance, growth was three times this year's predicted rate.  He stated that 88,000 units were produced by the Government on an annual basis, but he overlooked the fact that as Minister for Finance in 2005, Deputy Cowen was told by the IMF and the ESRI that the number of house completions was unsustainable.  Nonetheless, he went out and told everybody to keep building and the banks started to provide 100% mortgages.  The result has been negative equity and a fall in house prices for young couples.  Members of the Government should hang their heads in shame, as this does not stand up.The Minister of State also said that inflation is due to external factors, but the truth is that much of it is due to internal factors, such as Government-led increases across a range of sectors.  In the last seven years, areas regulated by the Government account for half of non-mortgage inflation.  Examples include housing and water, so to say that inflation is due to external factors does not stand up.  When the euro appreciated by 17% against sterling and the US dollar, the Government did absolutely nothing to make sure that the drop in price was passed on to the consumer.  Members of the Government are now taking credit for the small drop in the rate of inflation from 5% to 4.3%.  This inflation mainly affects the less well off.  A young mother trying to feed her family often cannot afford the new prices for bread, milk and so on.  People on social welfare cannot afford these rises, which are around 16% to 17%.  Shame on the Government.Towards the end of his speech, the Minister of State spoke about competitiveness and that there would have to be constraints.  Yet he takes credit for the fact that he and his colleagues are looking to defer the increases.  The Taoiseach should be telling us that Ministers will not take the increases.  The Minister of State also spoke about "finances permitting".  The report of the higher remuneration review group states that the increases are conditional upon the state of the public finances.  He will quote chapter and verse when it suits him, but he ignores it when it does not suit him.  He said that the Government's fiscal management over the past year brought about no shocks.  What about the 9% drop in the price of houses?  Up to 40,000 people have gone on the live register since the start of the year.  Economic growth is down to 1.6%, yet the Government was budgeting for 3%.First, Ministers must state that they will not be taking pay rises.  Second, they must introduce real public sector reform.  There should be a 2% cut in administrative services across all Departments, but not in front-line services.  Third, the Government must bring down the rate of inflation below the average rate in the eurozone.  Competitiveness is the key and we must get back to being a competitive country.  Our inflation rate in the past 28 months has been higher than the average rate in the eurozone.  Deputy Brian Lenihan has been appointed as Minister for Finance.  He must state that he will not sanction any inflationary increases in stealth taxes or Government charges.  He could examine a practical measure that Fine Gael proposed, namely, to merge the National Consumer Agency with the Competition Authority.  He should give the new body some teeth to make things competitive.  I support the Labour Party motion.  The speech of the Minister of State does an injustice to the House and to those finding it difficult, who are feeling the shocks.I congratulated the Minister of State on his appointment but it is nothing more than a smokescreen for what is happening in the economy.  There will be further appointments in coming week but that will also be a smokescreen.  The body politic and the people know that the Government made a mess of the finances.  We face an Exchequer deficit of €7 billion to €8 billion.  As Deputy Burton stated, we come perilously close to breaching the stability and growth guidelines set by the EU.  This was not mentioned in the speech of the Minister of State but it is relevant.  Inflation must be reduced and the less well off must be looked after.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I thank and congratulate the Labour Party on this motion.  The issues referred to by previous speakers were well known and well heralded over the past five years.  It was known to all economists and those studying the markets that this economy was running into difficulties, that we were becoming uncompetitive and losing jobs to lower cost economies.  Donegal, for instance, lost 3,000 jobs and this is a matter for the new Tánaiste to get her teeth into.  When the question of why this was happening was asked, the reply was that we were a high wage economy, trading in the top drawer.We should recall the second Boston tea party some years ago.  There were a succession of Boston tea parties but we have forgotten about the original.  The second took place when we were basing ourselves on Boston instead of Berlin.  Obviously, we failed to recognise that we were living in Europe.  In the intervening period, every constituency has lost jobs.  We have lost jobs not only to low wage economies but to competitive economies.The reason is that our economy was driven by one thing.  We have all spoken of this — why was nothing done?  Nothing was done because the Government gained in revenue.  Every time a house increased in price, the Government got more in VAT and stamp duty.  Everything in the garden was rosy and it was happy.  The Government reminded me of a hang-glider who had soared to the highest peaks.  Suddenly, the thermals were no longer there and everything is frozen.  We are now in a serious situation where young people in our constituencies seek housing to rent or buy.  They cannot afford to buy at today's prices and this applies to a whole generation.  I have not seen that for at least 15 years.  A large group of people cannot afford this and they will not buy because they recognise the pitfalls.The Government decided to place all its eggs in one basket.  When everything in the garden was rosy, it was fine and the Government had billions of euro in surpluses.  The Government did not know where to spend it; at least, we do not know where it was spent and it is all gone.  We have a shortage of school places and hospital beds, despite co-location and other antics to deflect public attention from reality.The lending industry inflated the economy more, much as it did to the agricultural economy in the 1980s.  In the 1980s we ended up with negative equity on all kinds of farm property.  After ten of the best years the country experienced in terms of growth, we end up with the possibility that the bubble could burst completely.  We look at locked up housing estates in the countryside where development has ceased.  The economy cannot sustain that for too long.  There must be movement in the market.  If that means prices must drop, this should be done but let us not delude ourselves.When the Government should have taken action, it could have taken action on credit control.  The yarn has been put out that, because of the EU, the Government could do nothing, and that property became attractive because of low interest rates.  That did not stop — and does not now stop — Governments in member states from introducing credit controls.  There is no reason why people could not expect to buy a house at reasonable value, instead of being ripped off.It is not very wise for people to suggest that holding on to the houses for long enough will result in someone paying for it.  It does not work that way, nor should it.I refer to some of the daft notions that visited the Government over the past number of years.  Let us consider e-voting as an economic example.  Where would one get a lunatic scheme like that?  Not only did the Government introduce it, it stuck with it.  Deputy Noel Dempsey was the father, then poor Deputy Cullen was the surrogate father who pursued it afterwards.

He is thinking that it is not his fault, he was not there and did not do it but in his heart and soul he knows that nobody should do these things and nobody should be allowed to walk away without taking the blame.When the economy takes a dip, it is important to have good quality houses.  There is no excuse for not having good quality houses or particular categories of house.  I have had countless people coming to my advice centres looking for a three bedroom house.  It is almost impossible to find one.  They find a single bedroom, a bedroom and a half, two bedroom but not three bedroom unless they pay a massive amount of money.  Everything is calculated to force the buyer to a particular area.  It is outrageous behaviour.  The Minister of State is a reasonable man and studies form all the time.  He knows full well that this is the daftest carry on.  As a newly appointed Minister of State we wish Deputy Mansergh well in his sojourn but I urge him to intervene with the powers that be.  For God's sake stop codding the people and do something positive for a change.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I wish to raise with the Minister of State the wide disparity in average waiting times in the Dublin area for 4,136 children who urgently require speech and language therapy services which vary from as low as three months in Dublin North-Central to 31 months in south Dublin and 32 months in Dublin west.I have been following up on this matter now for more than 12 months.  The situation in the south Dublin area, which includes my constituency, is going from bad to worse.  It is extraordinary in that in the Dublin area there are 4,136 children urgently seeking speech and language therapy.  The number involved is frightening when one considers the consequences for each child who does not receive early attention.The Bacon report, published six years ago, recommended that the number of speech and language therapists be increased four-fold to 100 per annum to attain a total of 12,085 therapists by 2015.  Those who have qualified are not being employed on the basis that they have no experience.  I do not understand how a person can gain experience without being given the opportunity to do so.  As a consequence, a number of young children in particular are waiting substantial periods for treatment.I raised on the Adjournment in January or February this year the situation in respect of a five year old child living in my constituency.  I contacted the HSE about this child on 10 November last and was told that having waited 12 months for assessment he had been assessed as an urgent case but that it would be at least a year before he obtained treatment.  Children are having to wait one year to be assessed and, having been assessed as in need of urgent treatment, must wait another year for it.In April, I decided to follow up on the matter to get the latest position in respect of this child.  I received a reply which stated that things were worse and that it would be at least another 12 months before got treatment.  Despite this child having been assessed as an urgent case, he will have to wait 18 months for treatment.In Dublin North-Central, there is a three month waiting period for assessment with 207 children on the waiting list.  In south Dublin, which includes Dun Laoghaire, there are 598 children on a waiting list and the waiting period is 31 months.  These figures were supplied to me by the HSE.  I cannot understand this.  In Dublin west, for example, the waiting period is 32 months.  Surely, something can be done about children five years old and upwards having to wait for up to 31 months at a minimum before they receive treatment.  I hope the Minister of State can explain to me this evening on what basis such disparity exists.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I take this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.I emphasise the Government's commitment to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment in disability services in recent years.  The national disability strategy launched in September 2004 reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities and provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities.  This strategy, together with the enhancement of other key support services, are key factors in building the additional capacity required to ensure that services best meet identified needs.The strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in equality legislation.  It puts the policy of mainstreaming public services for people with disabilities on a clear legal footing.  The main elements of the strategy are the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, EPSEN Act, sectoral plans published in 2006 by six Departments, Citizens Information Act 2007 and the multi-annual investment programme 2006-2009 for disability support services.An integral part of the national disability strategy is the multi-annual investment programme, MAIP, announced in the 2005 budget, which gives a commitment to a cumulative capital and revenue programme of €900 million with the bulk of this funding being spent on health services for people with a disability during the period 2006 to 2009.  These commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism in each of the years covered by the programme.As the Deputy is aware, an additional €50 million was allocated by the Government for the provision of disability services in budget 2008 of which €9.8 million was allocated for the provision of 140 additional therapy posts.  These 140 posts are being allocated to disability services in 2008 to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability and in particular with reference to the implementation of the Disability Act for children under five years of age, which commenced on 1 June 2007.By the end of the current multi-annual investment programme in 2009, it is expected that 1,235 new residential places, 398 new respite places and 467 new day care places will have been commissioned for intellectual disability services in addition to 380 new residential places and 1,150,000 extra personal assistant-home support hours for people with physical and sensory disabilities.With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy on the Adjournment, the HSE has informed the Department of Health and Children that speech and language therapists are concerned with the assessment, diagnosis and management of communication and swallowing disorders.  Children referred to speech and language therapy services undergo an initial assessment to identify the existence and severity of the need for ongoing therapy.  The priority for ongoing intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder, following assessment.The HSE has consistently endeavoured to prioritise the provision of speech and language therapy to children with speech and language delay or disorders.  The development of additional primary care services, through the establishment of primary care teams, has led to the creation of several additional speech and language therapy posts.  In addition, funding allocated for the development of disability services in line with the multi-annual investment programme and the national disability strategy also allowed an increase in speech and language therapy resources.  This prioritisation of speech and language therapy is evidenced by an increase in the number of speech and language therapists employed by the HSE and by agencies funded by the HSE from 498 in December 2004 to 724 in February 2008.  However, the HSE states that notwithstanding the 45% increase in speech and language therapy posts, some individual local health office areas have experienced difficulties in replacing staff members who have left the service.In addition the complexity of service delivery, including the way in which services have been managed by a range of agencies and funded across different care groups, has not resulted in a cohesive approach to service provision.  These factors have a bearing on the waiting times for services as raised by the Deputy in this Adjournment debate.  As part of its transformation programme, the HSE is developing co-ordinated early intervention services in each local health office.  This will ensure that all resources available to each local health office, including those in non-statutory agencies, work as part of a cohesive single service to address the needs of all children.The HSE states that it is also planning to improve the range and effectiveness of services to children from five to 18 years.  These plans are being developed in co-operation with the Office for Disability and Mental Health in the context of preparation for the implementation of the EPSEN Act and the extension of the Disability Act for this age cohort.  The Office for Disability and Mental Health was established in January of this year with a remit, inter alia, to facilitate the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with a disability.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with the opportunity to raise this important matter regarding the uncertainty about patient care for the people of Monaghan in light of the commitment of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm to wind down services at Monaghan General Hospital.  On Saturday, at least 5,000 people met in Monaghan Church Square to protest regarding their fear for the future.On Saturday morning, my colleague and Fine Gael health spokesperson, Deputy James Reilly, together with Senator Joe O'Reilly and myself, paid an arranged visit to Cavan General Hospital to see for ourselves what preparation, if any, has been made to cope with the downgrading of Monaghan General Hospital and the further proposals to take Monaghan General Hospital off call.  It was blatantly obvious that no such structure is available or likely to be available for the foreseeable future.  While some planning was explained to us, it was made clear that no additional budget has been granted and funding is already under severe pressure.We subsequently visited Monaghan General Hospital and met with the consultants and GPs to see at first hand the facilities available in Monaghan accident and emergency treatment room.  However, we were advised that no more than three patients are allowed to remain on trolleys in Monaghan under the so-called "protocol" whereas they can be transferred to the trolley system in Cavan or Drogheda, mostly against the wishes of the patients.  The treatment room at Monaghan General Hospital is fabulous and equal to none.The consultants in Monaghan have made every effort to work within the system to provide a safe and quality service to our patients.  An independent survey has shown that their delivery of service is of an extraordinarily high nature and better or as good as any other in the country.  I will quote a recent letter to the programme manager for the north-east transformation structure from the consultants who made it clear that "it is apparent to us following our meeting with the Cavan consultant physicians, that the availability of a critical care bed for a patient from Monaghan Hospital cannot be guaranteed.  We believe therefore, that the Protocol outlined is intrinsically unsafe and we hereby formally put that on the record."They also made it clear that:no extra resources have or will be provided at Cavan General Hospital to provide for 3,000 extra patients from Monaghan.  It is also apparent to us from our contact with our General Practitioner colleagues that no extra resources have been provided for care in the community.They further state: "if you discontinue the coronary care/acute care facility at this hospital you are compelled to show provision of a similar quality service elsewhere to which our patients can have recourse".I will provide the Minister of State with the full content of the letter sent to the HSE by the four Monaghan General Hospital consultants.  It is clearly one of a series of letters being sent to the Department and the HSE.  The situation in Monaghan General Hospital is at crisis level where the knowledge and ability of consultants is being ignored and ambulances are being advised to travel directly to Cavan by administrative staff rather than to Monaghan, in spite of the fact that the patients are almost certainly likely to finish up on trolleys.With a clear indication that no money is available for the necessary restructuring and provision of services in Cavan or elsewhere, it is vital that the Minister for Health and Children uses her influence to stop the lunacy of withdrawing an excellent service until, as she has previously promised, a better or as good alternative services is available.  This has been put on the record several times but it has been completely ignored.At least 17 people lost their lives unnecessarily as a result of Monaghan General Hospital being off call on a previous occasion.  If similar happens again, I will personally hold the Minister for Health and Children responsible along with the Taoiseach and those who support them.  I do not mean this as a threat but I want to make it absolutely clear.  Mr. Finbarr Lennon, a consultant at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, was a special adviser to the health board.  Once again, he has written to the HSE explaining how unsafe the situation is and begging it to step back
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I will take the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.The teamwork report, prepared for the Health Service Executive, has helped to inform the approach being adopted with regard to the transformation programme.  The report clearly indicated that the current service configuration in the north-east region is unsustainable and recommended a reconfiguration of hospital services across the existing five hospital sites to ensure the highest level of patient safety.  The report also identified a future role for all five hospital sites in the provision of acute hospital services.The transformation programme for the north-east region involves widespread and fundamental change and is designed to build a health system in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  In progressing the programme, the HSE has repeatedly emphasised its commitment that existing services in the region will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services.  The overriding aim of the programme, which has the full support of the Minister, is the need to improve safety and achieve better standards of care for patients in the region.The transformation programme is approaching the end of its initial phase of detailed planning and is moving towards detailed design and implementation.  The initial focus of the programme has been to have acute and complex care transitioned from five to two hospital sites by 2010.  In determining the future capacity of each hospital in the region, the HSE will need to have regard to the findings of reviews which it commissioned and which highlighted the potential to use the existing bed complement in a more efficient manner.  The reviews confirmed, for example, that acute hospital admissions and length of stay could be reduced if access to a range of support services is improved.

This interim report addresses many of the key short and medium-term planned service changes in Cavan and Monaghan together with a number of the initial changes proposed for Louth and Meath and lists the supporting changes that need to be in place in advance of or parallel with the centralisation of acute care.  These include enhanced ambulance services, medical assessment units——

In its draft capital plan, the HSE proposes to spend approximately €100 million additional capital funding up to 2013 in the north east to progress the transformation programme.  The HSE intends to make a capital allocation available in respect of each of the five hospitals in the region to meet the cost of interim infrastructural works necessary in each facility.The HSE envisages that the role of Monaghan General Hospital in the future will be to provide a range of diagnostic, outpatient, day cases and some in-patient treatment services within clinical networks.  Significant developments have also taken place with regard to the provision of surgical services across the Cavan and Monaghan hospital interface.  Emergency surgical services on a 24-hour, seven day basis are provided on the Cavan site while significant elements of diagnostic, outpatient and day case services are provided on the Monaghan Hospital site.  This has resulted in lower waiting times for out-patient appointments and in-patient elective services.  Since the reconfiguration of Cavan and Monaghan surgical services, patients can be seen by the visiting consultant surgeon on the day of referral by the GP.

This view was confirmed in the teamwork report and also in the north-east transformation programme.  The reconfiguration of services in the north east in a way which demonstrably delivers safer and more effective services for people in that region will continue to have the full support of the Minister.

The section is required without delay to fulfil the State's responsibility to children known by the HSE to be at serious risk of abuse or neglect, or being abused and neglected but who are receiving no assistance because of the recruitment embargo and the restrictive appointment controls.Last night's "Prime Time Investigates" programme revealed the horrific extent of the child protection crisis in this State.  Children are being abused and neglected or left at risk of abuse and neglect, even though their files are in the hands of the HSE and they are known to be in these situations.  We were faced in that programme with the chilling prospect of dozens of files on children at grave risk in filing cabinets with no action being taken because there are not enough social workers to deal with the massive caseload.  This is the devastating result of the cap on recruitment implemented by the HSE, for which the Government is ultimately responsible.  The report confirms the repeated warnings from social workers and others working with children and for children's rights that the under-resourcing of child protection services, social work, community care, family support and psychological and therapeutic services is having terrible consequences.  To make a bad situation worse, the current regime of cuts is being imposed by the HSE.We are all too familiar with waiting lists in our health services, but the waiting list of children in need of immediate intervention in crisis situations must surely be the worst.  It is appalling that there are waiting lists of more than a year for access to child mental health services and family support services.  The Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW, stated that its members are concerned, angered and frustrated that the right of children to effective protection and community care is being infringed.  On many occasions it has warned that children are at huge risk because of HSE failures.  The association said the programme drew attention to the realities faced by social workers and families attempting to access social work services.Many social workers experience stress, burn-out and exhaustion as they struggle to respond to an ever-increasing need with inadequate resources.  I join the association in its call on the Government and the HSE to act immediately to lift the current employment controls on social work posts and to fully resource community care social work teams throughout the country.  Declan Coogan of the IASW stated:Children at risk of abuse and neglect are among the most vulnerable group in our society, yet judging by the lack of provision of funding for community care social work services, little consideration is given to their welfare.  We demand that the HSE fully resource community care social work child protection and welfare teams and fully resource community mental health services.  No child should have to wait for essential social work and therapy services because someone somewhere has said there is no money.  It seems that the protection of children is at the bottom of the list of priorities of those who make decisions about funding but are remote from the consequences of these decisions.The Government cannot credibly claim that it did not know the extent of the problem as again and again  it has been warned.  For example, last December the Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, attended the launch of Barnardos' 2006 review, which stated that 91% of the children who came to Barnardos had family and relationship needs ranging from family discord to domestic violence.  The response to this crisis by the new Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, on "Morning Ireland" this morning can only be described as totally inadequate.  He was in automatic defence mode and he could not possibly have fully briefed himself on this crisis in the short time since he was appointed.  I am also disappointed at the response of the Taoiseach in the Dáil today.  Neither he nor the Minister of State treated the matter with the sense of urgency that is required.  They seemed not to recognise the justifiable outrage among people throughout the country that the most vulnerable of children in our society are being let down in such an appalling manner.I urge the Minister of State strongly to take immediate action to address the crisis to ensure that essential social workers are appointed and to ensure that those children most at risk are assisted with all possible speed.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Barry Andrews, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.In all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, the HSE responds immediately and takes appropriate action.  All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment, aimed at providing appropriate interventions.  Legislative mechanisms are in place which also allow for additional responses from the Garda.Increases in resources for child care and family support services have continued in recent years.  The HSE informed the Minister of State that a significant number of additional social work posts have been created since 2005 and funding of family support services has increased by 79%, from €45.7 million in 2003 to €81.8 million, in 2008.  This reflects the commitment of the Government and the HSE to the ongoing implementation of the national children strategy and, most recently, the overarching policy of the Office of the Minister for Children and the agenda for children's services.  The HSE has made significant advances in many areas of children's services.  For example, a well managed national approach is in operation in regard to special care and high support, dealing with the most needy children in HSE care.Developments in services provided through the HSE have, in more recent years, refocused on community-based family support sector targeting children and families at risk.  In many cases this is done in partnership with non-governmental agencies where the focus is building capacity in vulnerable communities.  This reflects the Government's policy of emphasising a preventive and supportive approach to child welfare.  The shift in emphasis towards community-based services and the increase in the HSE's staff complement in respect of new service developments are to be welcomed in this regard.  In addition, the inter-agency work promoted by the Office of the Minister for Children has led to improved co-operation in the delivery of children's services.The HSE's budget for 2008 is €14.2 billion, an increase of 8% on 2007.  Employment in the health sector must reflect the funding available and the HSE is responsible to live within the funding voted by the Oireachtas to deliver its service plan commitments.  As regards employment control issues, the HSE has received ministerial approval for a revised ceiling of 110,600 for the end of 2007, with an additional 1,050 posts for new developments announced in budget 2008.  Within this overall employment ceiling, it is the HSE's responsibility to deploy resources in line with priorities identified in its service plan.  Total numbers employed at end March 2008 are 110,156 compared to the ceiling of 111,650.  The temporary pause in recruitment, initiated as part of the HSE's financial break-even plan, ended on 31 December 2007.  Posts vacant since 1 January 2008 can, therefore, be filled subject to the provisions of the HSE's employment control framework for 2008, which provides for an assessment of the vacancy by HSE area monitoring groups, the protection of employment in frontline services and the reconfiguration of employment to meet the primary objectives of integrated service delivery and a fundamental shift in the delivery of health and personal social services from the hospital sector to primary, community and continuing care.  In this regard, 47 social worker vacancies are in the process of being filled by the HSE.The HSE successfully intervenes with children and families at risk on a daily basis.  There remains a concern that any diminution of public confidence in the child protection system, for any reason, could result in individuals being reluctant to report child protection concerns.  There is an onus on us all to ensure this does not happen.  In this regard, it is imperative everyone is aware of their own and the HSE's responsibility under Children First — the National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  My colleague, the Minister of State and his office will continue to work with the HSE to monitor and review services for children and families and to ensure the available resources are applied to greatest effect, leading to improvements in child welfare and protection services.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The need for the establishment of a working group to examine legislation for the regulation of dog breeding establishments is borne out of a concern for an area that falls outside mainstream animal breeding, which is open to much abuse.  In the same way as turkey and brussels sprouts farmers, many of these people see Christmas as the golden time to sell.  We see what happens when dogs are given to children as Christmas presents and end up on the road, in the wild or in animal welfare pounds by the middle of January.With that in mind, a working group was set up in October 2004.  It brought together many of the people involved in dog breeding establishments to try to bring to heel those who abuse animals purely for unscrupulous commercial purposes in the same way as dog fighting, which was carried out in the past and probably continues under the radar in the black economy.  The group held four meetings over a two-year period and came up with draft recommendations.  Since the autumn session, I have asked the Minister when he was going to publish those recommendations and his own recommendations.One thing was clear.  In its deliberations, there were areas that were outside the terms of reference which came up for discussion, one of which is the need to introduce microchipping to assist gardaí and dog wardens in identifying animals.  This may present problems for legitimate breeders who want to sell their animals abroad.The group identified the need for but did not have the authority to recommend that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government carry out a review of the Control of Dogs Act and that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carry out a review of the Protection of Animals Act and the duty of care associated with that in the same way as for mainstream farming.  It also identified the need for better education.  This goes back to the Christmas or birthday buzz people get from buying their children a dog they are unable to take care of.  It also looked at ways of reducing the number of animals that must be put down annually by way of spaying and neutering and highlighted the need to encourage that.We do not want to see this legislation brought in purely on foot of the recommendations because it is not the complete picture.  This area is to be transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  In reality, that may not happen before these regulations are put in place.  This must be brought back before the House to be debated because all of those other areas must be brought into the pot before we get proper legislation.There are people out there who have large-scale puppy farms with thousands of animals.  I am not exaggerating.  If this was implemented as legislation, it would not be possible to control these people.  The ISPCA says that it cannot take the animals into its care, while the gardaí say it is the responsibility of the ISPCA, which does not have the resources.  If there is an outbreak of disease or other animal welfare issue affecting large animals, we are able to organise a cull for the greater good of animals and animal welfare.We must bring the recommendations of this committee back to the House for further discussion to try to fine tune them and make it a comprehensive piece of law before it is put on the Statute Book.  Is it the aim of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring it back here to be discussed?  What is the timeframe for transferring responsibility in this area to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  Will the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government set up an interdepartmental think tank because that is needed?  Will this happen before legislation is introduced?  We do not want to see these regulations published one day, which the Minister seemingly has the right to do, without coming back here to be discussed as primary legislation.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank Deputy Andrew Doyle for raising this issue.  The role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government relates primarily to dog licensing and controls on dangerous dogs in the interest of the protection of the public and other animals, i.e., the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 along with associated regulations.In the light of a number of reports about substandard "puppy farms", the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government undertook in 2006 to consider regulation of dog breeding establishments in the interest of animal welfare.  A working group was established to review the management of dog breeding establishments nationally.  The group, which included a cross section of people with professional and welfare involvement with dogs, produced a majority report for the then Minister with a set of recommendations.  However, three minority reports were also presented by bodies represented on the working group.  In light of that, a period of public consultation followed and while there was not universal agreement with the recommendations, the then Minister concluded that there was sufficient agreement that they should be implemented.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is currently finalising a set of draft regulations in accordance with current control of dogs legislation which will give statutory effect to most of the recommendations contained in the majority report of the working group.  This majority report contained a set of recommendations which are set out as follows.  It was recommended that dog breeding establishments be defined based on the number of female dogs with breeding potential present on the premises.  A dog breeding establishment would be defined as "a premises containing more than five female dogs, aged over four months, with breeding potential".  In respect of the funding of the regulatory system, it was recommended that the new regulatory regime be self-financing and be funded by increasing the general dog licence fee for dogs kept in breeding establishments.  In respect of permanent identification, it was recommended that all dogs kept in breeding establishments, including their offspring, be electronically microchipped to ensure traceability and assist the enforcement of the registration system.  The group also recommended that greyhounds be exempted where they have already met the Irish Greyhound Board's identification requirements.  In respect of the transportation and export of dogs, it was recommended that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food implement regulations for the transportation of consignments of dogs within the State and for export.  These regulations would cover transportation standards, minimum space requirements, ventilation, route plans, journey durations, feeding and watering intervals.  It was agreed that every dog owner and dog breeder has a "duty of care" in respect of animals kept by them and it was recommended that this be enshrined in all animal welfare legislation.  In respect of lead-in time, it was recommended that the new dog breeding registration system be introduced on a phased basis using an improvement notice model to avoid the creation of a surplus of dogs caused by the closure of substandard dog breeding establishments.Since the working group's report was issued, the Department has undertaken extensive consultation with relevant central and local authorities and a large number of interested organisations.  In finalising the regulations, a comprehensive round of discussions took place between the Department and a range of veterinary, dog welfare and other interested bodies.  Guidelines will also be introduced in conjunction with the regulations which will focus strongly on the welfare requirements of dogs in these establishments. These guidelines have been extensively informed by discussions with, and valuable input from, leading veterinary and animal welfare organisations.Certification of registration of dog breeding establishments will be undertaken by local authorities as part of their dog control responsibilities.  It is intended that a registration fee graded in accordance with the size of the establishment will apply in order to finance the scheme.In general, while there remains some opposition to the recommendations, there is general support for regulation in this area.  It is a complex area with a very large and diverse number of interested parties and stakeholders.  It is not considered practical to introduce interim arrangements for the regulation of puppy farms in advance of these new regulations and I understand that it is the Minister's intention to finalise matters in the coming weeks.  The regulations represent one aspect of reform in regard to dog control.  Other issues raised in the course of discussions with interested parties will be examined with a view to introducing additional reforms in the future.

It is my belief that the arts are critical to the health of society, to enhancing the life of local communities and to giving expression to place and identity.I recognise that the benefits of the arts for the individual are greatly increased if exposure to the arts takes place during a person's most formative years and, for that reason, it is important that the arts be embedded in our education system.  For this reason also it is important that initiatives aimed at involving children and young people are prioritised.The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; andto assist in improving standards in the arts.In 2008 the budget for the Arts Council is €82.102 million.  The Council will disburse €4.6million of these funds to young people, children and to education — in and out of school.  €3.9m of this is allocated to organisations and projects that focus on work exclusively with children and young people.  A further €700,000 will be provided to festivals, venues, local authorities and to education programmes of the Arts Council's clients that offer programmes to children and young people as part of a wider remit.  Taken together these figures represent a 26% increase on 2007.In addition the Department has provided funding for the Creative Engagement arts projects in schools.  The initiative is run by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.Last year, a special sub-committee of the Arts Council produced the Arts in Education Report.  I have yet to study this report in fine detail and when I have received a report from the Interagency Group on Implementing the proposals in it, I will pursue the issue as a matter of priority.In recent years, the Ark Cultural Centre for Children has been awarded €1,387,738 in Capital funding by the Department.  In 2001, a grant of €1,269,738 was made towards the project, in 2007, the Ark was awarded €118k towards the purchase of equipment for the theatre, workshop, gallery and office, and front of house works.In addition current funding of €100,000 was awarded in 2006 towards the 2007 EU Year of the Child, and a further €100,000 was awarded in 2008 towards the 2008 EU Year of Intercultural Dialogue.

It recommends a series of initiatives aimed at supporting increased participation in the arts and on creating a more inclusive and cohesive society.Such complex and cross-cutting proposals require to be dealt within an imaginative and robust manner.  I am aware that plans have been formulated to implement the Government decision on the formation of a high-level implementation group.  As part of this procedure, the Cultural Institutions within my Department's remit have been asked to comment on the recommendations of the Report and on how they could assist in their implementation.  When these comments have been received I will examine the best way to progress the recommendations of the report including the establishment of the implementation Committee.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The decision by the Government to provide financial assistance for the development of the new stadium at Lansdowne Road was in response to a joint proposal from the IRFU and the FAI.  As the ownership of the stadium was not, and is not, jointly shared between the IRFU and the FAI, that particular aspect did not form part of the Government's consideration of the proposal.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.Since 1998 the Programme has allocated over €675 million to over 6,700 projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breath of the country.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.While the Sports Capital Programme does not give any priority to jointly owned facilities, the Programme has given very generous funding to multi-sports facilities that accommodate a number of different sports in one integrated venue.  Under the 2007 programme, over €5m was allocated to large municipal multi-sport facilities.  When the amount allocated to community based local multi-sport facilities is added to this, over €15m was allocated last year alone to multi-sport facilities.  This is against a backdrop of sustained sports capital investment in this sector since 1998.  In the period 1998-2007, sports capital funding of over €126 million was allocated to community and municipal multi-sport projects.  These projects include sports facilities built by local authorities, community sports facilities and multi-sport clubs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Agreed Programme for Government commits to the roll out of the Local Sports Partnership programme on a nationwide basis to provide for the development of sport at local level.  The Irish Sports Council has a statutory role in the promotion and development of sport, including initiatives such as the Local Sports Partnership network, through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and coordinated.The Local Sports Partnerships are charged with increasing participation at a local level, ensuring that local resources are used to best effect and making sure that the experiences of participants in sport are positive.Following an independent review of the LSPs by Fitzpatrick Associates in 2005, the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, gave approval to the ISC to extend the LSP network from 2006 on a national basis.  Accordingly, funding has been provided to the ISC to facilitate continued extension of the network.The ISC has informed me that there are currently 29 LSPs fully operational, with coordinators in place, and the remaining four sites are finalising recruitment arrangements.  All 33 LSPs should be fully operational by July 2008.The Irish Sports Council provides support and advice to the LSPs and is working to create productive relationships with the local sports coordinators, including the creation of a coordinators network.  The ISC has provided training to the LSPs and will continue to provide regular information and training updates.  The ISC is also involved in the development of specific programmes, courses and resource materials for the LSPs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I am well aware of the positive role which participation in sport and the arts can have on young people, including in drugs prevention.  Such participation has a positive impact on character formation and development and acts as an antidote to social misbehaviour.The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by the Department, has a statutory role in increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC's basic philosophy is, therefore, one of inclusion and its Statement of Strategy recognises the potential of sport to be a driver for social change dealing with issues such as exclusion and social inequality.The increased funding provided to the ISC, from €13 million in 2000 to more than €57 million in 2008, has enabled a number of significant interventions for the benefit of children and young people.  Examples include the Local Sports Partnership (LSP) network, the Buntús programmes for pre-schools and primary schools in LSP areas (involving children in sport from a very young age) and the Youth Field Sports Initiative.In particular relation to young people and sport, the ISC, through the LSPs, continues to roll out the Buntús programme in primary schools and child day care centres.  The Programme aims to support the primary PE curriculum by providing equipment, resource cards and training to primary school teachers and childcare workers and allows them introduce sport to children in a safe and fun way.  In addition, there are five sport specific Buntús programmes currently available to primary schools: soccer, rugby, golf, basketball and badminton.Furthermore, with the support and cooperation of the Department and Pobal, additional funding has been allocated to the ISC to support various grant schemes including the funding programme "Sports for Disadvantaged Youth".  This programme, with funding amounting to almost €2 million, is administered by the ISC and delivered through the existing LSP structures and local authorities where an LSP is not yet in place.  Its aim is to increase participation in sport among 12-19 year olds in disadvantaged areas.Funding is also made available, under the Youth Field Sports Initiative, by the ISC to increase participation among young people in the three main field sports: Gaelic games, rugby and soccer.  Separate funding allocations are made to the GAA, IRFU and FAI in this regard.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by the Department, sports projects that are located in and endorsed by the Local Drugs Task Force are prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications.These applicants are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available (10% as against the normal 30%) towards their project, and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process under the level of socio-economic disadvantage criterion.Last year, €12.78 million was provisionally allocated to projects based in Local Drugs Task Force areas under the Sports Capital Programme.In relation to the arts, my policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The general functions of the Council include stimulating public interest in the arts, promoting knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts and assisting in improving standards in the arts.The underpinning rationale for Arts Council policy in relation to young people extends to considering the specific needs of children and young people, as part of a contemporary and future public, so as to ensure their entitlement to access and respond to high quality artistic and aesthetic experiences.I look forward to the opportunity to put forward the observations of the Department as part of the review of the National Drugs Strategy.

This programme which is being overseen by the Office of Public Works comprises 9 separate phases and includes the upgrading of the security and sprinkler systems in various buildings, the refurbishment of the former National College of Art and Design and the redevelopment of No. 4 Kildare Street as the Library's administrative offices.  The proposed new Repository will contain the Library's valuable book collection and manuscripts.  The Repository will house active collections that the public use and require access to every day from the Library's reading rooms.  The new Repository will act as a Book Store and also as "a bridge" as it will link the disparate buildings of the NLI.Funding of the Repository for the National Library of Ireland falls within the funding allocated to the National Development Plan.  Under this Plan  €470 million capital funding has been allocated to the Cultural Sub-Programme in respect of capital projects for the non-commercial National Cultural Institutions.  The annual capital funding for these institutions, which is provided to my Department under the Estimates process, is subsumed into the NDP.The NDP programme for the non-commercial National Cultural Institutions seeks to provide improved/redeveloped facilities that will enhance the display and safe storage of the valuable paintings, artefacts and documents of national importance held in the Collections of these bodies.  The badly needed improvements proposed under the NDP will provide a valuable national resource, which will enable Ireland to celebrate its history, to foster its literary and cultural legacies and to enhance the lives of its citizens through access to the national cultural collections held in care by these bodies and they will assist in the establishment of Ireland in the international cultural tourism market.  The National Library of Ireland is a vital component of this programme.

As part of the contingency planning for the repossession of the Centre, the Authority established a subsidiary company, NSCDA (Operations) Ltd., to operate the Centre.To date it has been necessary to provide both operational and capital subsidies to meet the costs of a comprehensive "health check" carried out on the Centre following repossession from the previous operators together with a maintenance programme required to bring the facility back to standard.Following the first full year of operation under the new arrangements, a clearer picture of the operational needs of the Centre is emerging.  I am encouraged by the significant increase in both visitor numbers and income which have already been achieved.The Authority has arranged for a financial assessment study, which will benchmark the National Aquatic Centre against other equivalent facilities, to be carried out.  This work is now nearing completion.  When the consultants report comes to hand it will be evaluated by the Authority who will advise me on the issues involved.  This exercise, together with the Centre's performance since it reverted to the direct control of the Authority, will inform my decisions on the funding requirements of the Centre in the longer term.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I propose to take Questions Nos. 94 and 101 together.I am aware that the draft report prepared by the Special Committee on Arts and Education, jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Education and Science, has been under consideration by our two Departments with the Arts Council in recent months.  I should point out however, that the publication of the report is in fact a matter for the Arts Council.The Committee's remit was to advise the Council on how best to align the Council's strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.  This draft report represents the first study of this nature and deserves a practical and reasoned approach in considering its recommendations, which reflect the result of the wide-ranging and in-depth research that was conducted by the Committee and for which they are to be congratulated.In this context, officials of my Department have organised a series of meetings with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council to consider the recommendations of the report.  This interagency work group is currently in the process of identifying ways of giving practical effect to the crucial recommendations of the draft report and is drawing up specific actions designed to respond effectively and efficiently to its conclusions.I would also like to point out that it is due in no small measure to the massive investments made in recent years by this Government to the capital and everyday costs of the worthwhile various arts entities throughout the country that we are in a position to have had such a study carried out.In the past five years, for instance, my Department has allocated a total of €86 million towards the cost of providing vital arts and cultural infrastructure and venues for communities to present the arts in all its forms.  Complementary to this the Arts Council has seen its resources increase exponentially from €47.67 million in 2002 to its present allocation of over €82 million in 2008, an increase of over 72%.  The Arts Council in turn has at all times pursued a policy of engaging with young people, whether through its specific programmes or by its support of existing organisations that specialise in arts in education interventions, such as The Ark and Team in Dublin, Graffiti Theatre in Cork and Cups and Crowns Educational Theatre in Galway.  These are signs of a maturity in our arts role and the integration of the arts into every aspect of our society.The outcome of the Special Committee on Arts and Education will be a further piece in the jigsaw of this exciting and wide-ranging arts and education spectrum.  I look forward to realising, as far as practicable, the conclusions of this work.  This is an issue with which I will be familiarising myself over the coming weeks to form an approach in dealing with the recommendations of the report.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I refer the Deputy to my predecessor's reply to Parliamentary Question reference number 31505/07 on the 29th November, 2007, and Parliamentary Question reference number 10973/08 on the 13th March, 2008, which outlined the background to the Heritage Fund.A very positive review of the governance and operation of the Heritage Fund, which is now virtually depleted, has been completed.As the existing legislation does not allow for the replenishment of the Fund, new primary legislation will be necessary to enable a new Fund to be established.  Preparatory work in relation to this legislation has been undertaken in the Department. I intend to progress this legislation in 2008.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The amount of funding available for spending on sport in 2008 is €336 million which demonstrates a clear and substantial commitment to investment in sport by this Government.  In 2008 my Department has allocated €57.631 million to the Irish Sports Council, an increase since the last Olympic year of €26.9 million, or 87%.One of the ISC's primary functions is to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and the achievement of excellence in competitive sport.  In this regard the ISC works in partnership with the Irish Institute of Sport, the Olympic Council of Ireland, the Paralympic Council of Ireland and the relevant governing bodies of sport in the preparation of Irish athletes for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  I am informed by the ISC that significant progress has been made to date by all the agencies in preparation for the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games.The Olympic and Paralympic Councils of Ireland are the agencies responsible for the organisation and participation of the Irish teams at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The Irish Sports Council provides annual funding to both Councils for administration and programme costs aimed specifically at preparation for the Games.  The OCI and PCI have responsibility for a number of areas including:(i) team selection (following nominations from governing bodies of athletes that have reached qualification standards);(ii) selection of support personnel;(iii) team manager training programmes;(iv) preparation visits to Beijing by key personnel;(v) heat and acclimatisation strategy;(vi) the organisation of multi-sport camps in advance of the Games;(vii) all logistics at Games time: and(viii) liaison with the organising committee and the International Olympic Committee.Primary responsibility for the preparation and performance of individual athletes rests with the relevant National Governing Body or, in the case of Paralympic sports, the Paralympic Council of Ireland.I am assured by the ISC that planning has been comprehensive and well funded, with plans implemented by top quality professionals at every step.  The ISC has defined success as meeting its target of six finalists at the Olympics.  This target is still in place and I hope it will be achieved.In February 2008, the ISC announced the allocation of €9 million in High Performance Support.  15 focus sports received over €5.9 million for their high performance plans, athletes and teams received over €2.2 million under the International Carding Scheme and the Institute of Irish Sport received €935,000.  This brought the total to €30.06 million invested in this Olympic and Paralympic cycle.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The funding of the Irish Sports Council and the Arts Council, as with all Departments and State agencies, is a matter for consideration under the annual Budget and Estimates process.  Under this process, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.  My Department, like all other Departments, is provided with its annual expenditure budget through the Estimates process.Since 2002, when my Department was founded, funding for the Arts Council has increased by 72% from €47.7 million in 2002 to €82.1 million in 2008.  Over the same period funding for the Irish Sports Council has increased by over 100% from €28.7 million in 2002 to €57.6 million in 2008.  The Government's commitment to both arts and sport is evidenced by these substantial increases in funding.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Deputy will be aware that the Report in question contained a number of recommendations.  While some of these recommendations were relevant to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism (and Agencies under the Department's remit), there were a number of recommendations which come under the remit of other Government Departments, including the Department of Education and Science.The Irish Sports Council (ISC) has a statutory role in the promotion and development of sport, including initiatives such as the Local Sports Partnership (LSP) network, through which sports initiatives at local level are delivered and coordinated.The LSPs are charged with increasing participation at a local level, ensuring that local resources are used to best effect and making sure that the experiences of participants in sport are positive.I understand that recently the Irish Sports Council has announced that the national LSP network is complete and will be fully operational by July 2008.  In relation to Buntús, the ISC have indicated that the number of primary schools involved in the Buntús programme should be increased when the roll out of the national network of LSPs is completed.With regard to the recommendations in relation to the Arts, I should point out that responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; andto assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council has consulted with the National Council for Curriculum Assessment (NCCA) in relation to the arts curriculum in schools and has also prepared guidelines for people in the arts working with children and young people — "Guidelines for the protection and welfare of children and young people in the arts sector".Much work has been done by the Arts Council to develop the arts at a local level, not necessarily based on the Local Sports Partnerships, which are a specific model of practice.  The Council has worked strategically with local authorities for 23 years in developing the arts at local level and the focus was more on embedding arts expertise at the heart of the local authority service.  Each of the 34 local authorities in Ireland employs a full-time Arts Officer.  In many instances local authorities lead in providing a broader Arts Service, employing several specialist arts staff in addition to the Arts Officer.Throughout this time the Arts Council has enjoyed a unique partnership with local authorities in developing the arts and cultural landscape at local level throughout the country.  Originating in 1985 with a strategy to place professional arts expertise directly within the local authority, this has been an area of exponential growth and development over the past two decades.In 2007 Local Authorities, spent in excess of €36m on the arts, demonstrating the huge commitment that is being made at local level to arts development.  Under a provision of the Arts Act 2003, local authorities are required to prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas, and in so doing to take account of government policies on the arts.  Many local authorities had already established a track record in planning for the arts and, in several cases, are now on their third such strategy.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I understand that a levy of €1 per bed per night is among a number of measures considered by Dublin City Council to raise revenue in the context of a submission to the Commission on Taxation and that this has been included in the Council's proposals to the Commission on Taxation, which falls under the aegis of the Minister for Finance.The tourism industry, including hotels, already contributes very significantly to the funding of local authorities through commercial rates, as well as through local charges for water and for waste disposal.  Hotels also contribute to the overall tax base, and hence indirectly to local authorities, through corporation profits tax, VAT and income taxes.Recent turmoil in financial markets and international economic difficulties will increase the challenges facing the tourism industry.  The strengthening of the euro against the dollar and sterling gives rise to additional challenges in two of our key markets — the United States and Britain.  In my view any measure that drives up costs to tourists visiting Ireland and threatens the competitiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination should be avoided, if possible.I do not believe that additional taxes or other costs should be imposed without full consideration of the implications for a key sector of the economy, such as tourism.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 104 together.Since the National Museum of Ireland became an autonomous statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 on 3rd May 2005, the Board of the National Museum is statutorily responsible for operational matters concerning its collection and I, as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, do not have a statutory function in respect of operational matters.This Department is in discussion with the Museum regarding the resources which are required to implement the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report on the National Museum of Ireland.In 2008, this Department provided the National Museum with a funding allocation of in excess of €19 million.  Within the overall allocation, funding was specifically provided to commence the establishment of an inventory control system and the introduction of extended opening hours, which were two key recommendations in the report.A number of key issues relating to the storage of the national collection held by the Museum are to be addressed in the context of the funding provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 to meet storage requirements for the national cultural collecting institutions and in the context of the development of the new Centre Block galleries in Collins Barracks, which will offer significant options for the display and storage of key elements of the national collection held by the Museum.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Funding for the Arts Council has increased by over 72% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €82.102 million in 2008.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers' money in any context and have transformed the arts sector, increasing access to and participation in the arts for all our citizens.  The Government's commitment to the arts is evidenced by these substantial increases in funding.This level of funding has enabled the Arts Council to dramatically increase the number of organisations it supports and the level of funding it provides.The funding of the Arts Council, as with all Government Departments and State agencies, is a matter for consideration under the annual budget and Estimates' process.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.The Sports Capital Programme is the primary vehicle for the development of sports facilities across the country.  The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.Since 1998 over 6,700 projects have been allocated over €675 million under the Programme, including over €107 million for the development of Croke Park.  In this regard, demand for funding under the Programme continues to be very strong, for example, in 2008 funding totalling €292 million is being sought by over 1,450 projects.This funding must be seen in the context of the equally significant levels of current funding being provided through the Irish Sports Council.  The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and for increasing participation in recreational sport.All sports organisations funded by the ISC, including National Governing Bodies and Local Sports Partnerships, are encouraged to target all sections of society in seeking to increase participation in sport.The funding provided to the ISC, which has increased from €13m in 2000 to more than €57m this year, has enabled a number of significant interventions to increase participation in sport.  In this regard, examples include the Local Sports Partnerships network and the Buntús programme for primary schools in LSP areas involving children in sport from a very young age.The Government is making very significant investment in addressing participation in sport through both current and capital funding streams.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	299	It is my belief that the arts are critical to the well-being of society, enhancing the life of local communities, and giving artistic expression to place and identity.  Much work has been done to develop the arts at a local level, not necessarily based on the Local Sports Partnerships, which are a specific model of practice.  The Arts Council, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which is funded by the Department, has worked strategically with local authorities for 23 years in developing the arts at local level and the focus was more on embedding arts expertise at the heart of the local authority service.

The national cultural institutions currently occupy buildings and locations, which are of great aesthetic, historical and cultural significance.  The State has invested considerably in the development of these locations and is continuing to do so. The National Development Plan 2007-2013, includes an extensive programme of major capital developments in the national cultural institutions.  This programme includes the development of the Centre Block exhibition galleries at the National Museum in Collins Barracks and the redevelopment of the Natural History Museum, the development of a new National Concert Hall and a new National Theatre, the major extension of facilities at the National Library, the National Gallery, the Chester Beatty Library, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the redevelopment of the National Archives.

This paper is currently under active internal discussion and once this has been completed it is intended to develop a more precise strategy in relation to encouraging philanthropic support of the arts.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information.  Phase one, which focuses on national and regional sports facilities, has now been completed within my Department.  Phase two of the audit, which is a more complex undertaking to establish a record of existing sports facilities at local level and identifying the need for future provision, will be undertaken during 2008 with the assistance of Local Authorities.  Guidelines have now been issued to Local Authorities to assist them in carrying out the audit.The audit is part of a wider exercise to put in place a more strategic approach to the provision of sports facilities in Ireland.  Work on the National Sports Facility Strategy is currently underway in my Department.  An inter-agency steering group was established to oversee the development of the strategy and consultants, involving both national and international experts in the area of sports facilities, were engaged to assist in the preparation of the strategy.  The consultants report is being finalised at present and will then be appraised by the steering group.The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the facilities requirement for sport so that participation at a reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport at either amateur or elite level.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 300 together.The Government has provided an amount of €149m in the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013 for the development of a National Sports Campus at Abbotstown.  In November 2005 the Government approved the commencement of Phase One of the development of the National Sports Campus on the basis of a Development Control Plan prepared by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company Ltd. — the predecessor of the National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA).  These facilities will be designed to meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons who compete at national and international levels and will also provide for the needs of the local community.The Government decision for this stage of development also included agreement to relocate the headquarters of the Football Association of Ireland to the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown.  Work on the building has been completed and the FAI took possession of the building in December last year.It is also intended to provide a headquarters for the Irish Institute for Sport by refurbishing the former Central Meat Control Laboratory building on the site.  Planning permission for the refurbishment has been secured and it is expected that this work will be completed by end year.The NSCDA recently completed the signing of contracts with a Project Management team and a Design Team.  These teams have already commenced a consultation process with the relevant National Governing Bodies of Sport on their detailed requirements on the Campus.  It will be the task of these teams to prepare the planning applications and it is anticipated that planning permission will be sought by end year.  With a projected construction period of 3 to 4 years, the first phase of the project is expected to be completed in late 2011.The Abbotstown facilities, when completed, will provide a much needed range of training and competitive facilities for our finest sportspersons.

The ACCESS scheme is a key element in the Government's regional arts strategy and has greatly improved participation in the arts for large numbers of people, including community groups, nationwide.  The scheme has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces.Under the scheme, funding is provided towards integrated community art centres, theatres and galleries as well as art studios and other arts production, creative and performance spaces.A total of almost €86m has been granted to 120 projects across the country under the scheme, many of which were community based arts groups.  All of the available funds under the current round of the ACCESS scheme have been fully allocated.  The Department is currently examining the option of a third round of ACCESS.Applications for any new round would be invited by public advertisement.  Applications are assessed on the basis of clear and transparent evidence and advice and take account of the views and expertise of the Arts Council.  Any group, including community based arts organisations, that meets the eligibility criteria, will be welcome to submit an application under any new scheme.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) includes a question on the nationality of the usual residents of the households selected.  Based on the responses to the question, the results can distinguish the labour force characteristics of Irish and non-Irish nationals. This is done in Tables A1 and A2 of the QNHS release.The QNHS also allows immigrant and emigrant flows to be distinguished.  Immigrants are analysed by sex, broad age group, country of origin and nationality while emigrants are analysed by sex, broad age group and country of destination.  The results are contained in the annual population and migration release.Capturing the details of emigrants gives rise to greater difficulty than reporting on immigrants because the former have already departed and therefore reliance has to be placed on some of those remaining in the household to report the details.Complete households emigrating pose a particular difficulty.  Because of this and the level of uncertainty surrounding the measurement of migration flows the published net migration figures are preliminary and subject to amendment once the results of the next census become available.Notwithstanding these difficulties, the CSO accepts that the nationality of those who have emigrated needs to be distinguished and advises me that it is currently examining what additional measures might be possible to strengthen the available data in this respect.The CSO regrets that the correspondence addressed to it by the national organisation (details supplied) was not replied to in a timely manner.  This arose because the correspondence was addressed to an officer who is on long-term sick leave.  I understand that a reply has since issued addressing the points raised and that the organisation is happy to accept the CSO's apology in respect of the unintentional oversight.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The initial application for a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, is made to the Senior Medical Officer of the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area.If the Primary Medical Certificate has been refused in this case, the named person may appeal the refusal to the Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.  I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.

This incorporates the carrying out of minor maintenance works, such as weeding,  twice a year.  Litter bins are provided by the local Tidy Towns group.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	317	This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the amounts due in this case are based on tax returns submitted by the taxpayer.  These returns indicate liabilities as well as credits due to the taxpayer.  Contact is being made with the person concerned, through his agent, to clarify the situation regarding these liabilities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The position is that the activities of tidy towns organisations may be regarded as being established for charitable purpose under the category of benefit to the broader community.  The other categories of charitable purpose are the advancement of religion, the relief of poverty and the advancement of education.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a number of tidy town organisations already enjoy charitable tax exempt status.There are two key requirements which have to be satisfied for a body to attain charitable status for tax purposes.  The first is that the body must be established solely for charitable purposes.  This would normally be stated in the body's governing instrument.  Secondly, the body must apply its funds solely for charitable purposes.  This means that on an ongoing basis, the body must conduct itself in accordance with its governing principles and failure to do so will result in a removal of charitable tax exempt status and access to the associated tax exemptions.Full details in relation to the application process (including the application form) are contained in information booklet CHY1 "Applying for Relief from Tax on the Income and Property of Charities" and can be obtained online at www.revenue.ie or by ringing Lo call 1890 666 333.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund's statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.  This framework has given the Commission the freedom to develop, outside of the political process, a long-term investment strategy primarily based on a diversified portfolio of real assets.Given this commercial investment mandate, the investment portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund does not include financing for micro-credit schemes in the developing world.  However, the Deputy will be interested to know that a number of Non-Governmental Organisations funded by Irish Aid — which is responsible for Ireland's official overseas aid programme — are active in the area of micro-credit.  In 2007, Concern Worldwide directed over €1.1 million of Multi-Annual Programme Scheme (MAPS) funding towards micro-credit schemes.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	320	If what the Deputy has in mind is the taxation at 10 per cent of portions of the bands currently taxable at 20 per cent, the full-year cost to the Exchequer, by reference to the income tax year 2008, is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be about €690 million.  This cost is estimated on the basis that the thresholds for the proposed new tax bands would not alter the existing standard rate cut-off point applying to single and widowed persons, lone parents and married couples.If, however, the existing 20 per cent bands were to apply in addition to the 10 per cent bands suggested by the Deputy, the cost would be substantially higher, and is estimated by Revenue to be in excess of €1.5 billion in a full year.Given the current band structures, there would be major issues to be worked out as to how, in practice, such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.  These figures are provisional and subject to revision.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The cost of answering a Parliamentary Question will vary according to the nature, and phraseology of the question asked and this inevitably involves differences in the costs among Departments and indeed within a Department from time to time.  Replies to such questions are treated with the utmost seriousness by Departments and Ministers and accordingly considerable care is taken with the replies.  Regulation of the manner in which questions are submitted and answered is a matter for the House itself.  I would be happy to consider any proposals the Oireachtas Commission may consider in this context.I would suggest that some information sought in Parliamentary Questions could be obtained less expensively if Deputies made fuller use of the information already available, requested it directly through the information offices of the Departments and other bodies concerned and exploited more fully the research facilities provided by the Oireachtas Commission through the Oireachtas Library and Research Services.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Section 110 of the Finance Act 2007 made provision for a charge to stamp duty where license agreements and other such arrangements are used when land is purchased for development without conveyance or transfer.  The provision ensured that these arrangements will incur a Stamp Duty charge where a landowner receives a payment amounting to 25% or more of the market value or consideration concerned.  Section 110 is subject to a commencement order on the basis that it would be prudent to consider the state of the housing and property market before the provision is put into place.For this reason, an independent study of the potential effects that such a provision may have on the market was commissioned.  The Report is available for download on my Department's website at http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/reports/2008/S110Report.pdf.As these transactions, under current law, do not involve a liability to Stamp Duty, there is no requirement to present any documentation to the Revenue Commissioners for stamping and there is therefore no specific data on which to accurately estimate any revenue gains from commencing the provisions.The Report also makes the point that there are no official data sources on the value of development land sales; therefore, it gives an indicative estimate of the total value of the development land market in 2006 at c. €7bn to €8bn.  Based on a technical assumption of 40% of land transactions using these arrangements, the Report estimated a potential revenue gain in 2006 of c. €251m if the provisions had been in place at that time.  However, this estimate is based on the historic levels of activity in 2006 and is not indicative of the revenue gain that would occur following commencement of the provisions at a later date.  A more realistic figure for the revenue accruing from the provisions is in the order of €50m per annum.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost of reducing the current 9% rate of stamp duty on commercial property to 8% is estimated at €133 million, based on Budget 2008 projections.  As this cost is a function of the actual and estimated number of transactions, and the price levels at which these transactions take place, it is therefore sensitive to cyclical changes in the commercial property market.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	324	While the increase in the price of fuel and in particular the disproportionate increase in the price of auto-diesel compared to petrol is not tax driven, the Government continues to monitor price developments.  I understand that the current increase in the price of auto-diesel is evident throughout the EU and some explanations that have been put forward include:shortage of diesel at European refineries; European diesel demand has far outgrown production,stock levels of petrol in the US are higher than anticipated which has contributed to the disproportionate increase in the price of diesel, andincreased demand for aviation fuel has also had a limiting effect on diesel production.Excise duty rates in Ireland for both auto-diesel and petrol are €368.05 and €442.68 per 1,000 litres of fuel respectively.  These rates are around the EU average and are less than our main trading partners particularly our nearest neighbour, the UK.  I would point out that the excise rates for both diesel and petrol have not been increased in the last four Budgets.It should be noted that the VAT content of purchases of auto-diesel is a deductible credit for businesses in the Irish VAT system.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.The position is that all homeowners who hold a qualifying loan with a qualifying lender may fully benefit from mortgage interest relief.Tax relief at source in respect of mortgage interest was introduced with effect from 1 January 2002.  Since that date a borrower is not required to be earning a taxable income to be eligible for mortgage interest relief.It is not clear what the Deputy has in mind regarding the cost of replacing mortgage interest relief with a tax credit.  The position is that, subject to limits, mortgage interest relief at the standard rate is granted on a qualifying loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of a principal private residence.  Tax relief at the standard rate is effectively operated in the same manner as a tax credit.The increased first-time buyer's limits of €10,000 for a single person and €20,000 for a married couple, announced in Budget 2008, equate to tax relief of up to €2,000 for a single person and €4,000 for a married couple that can be offset against qualifying interest.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the data requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of people who have paid preliminary tax and the number who have been charged interest as a result of non-payment in the last five years could not be compiled within the timeframe available.  Information on the lines requested by the Deputy will be forwarded to him by Revenue as soon as it is available.I am further advised by Revenue that prosecutions have not been taken for failure to pay preliminary tax in the past five years.  Where a person fails to pay the correct amount of preliminary tax by the due date, the full tax debt for the year becomes due on that date, and all subsequent late payments will be subject to an interest charge.  Revenue has focused its actions in response to preliminary tax non-compliance on the charging of interest as a more effective remedy in getting customers to become compliant.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	327	An implementation steering group has not been established.  However, many of the Study's objectives can be pursued by the Local Authorities from within their own resources.  Progress at a national level is dependent on provision of funding through the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	328	As the Deputy may be aware the new Office for Older People was established on 30th January 2008.  The resources of the new Office, which is currently staffed by officials from the Department of Health and Children, will be strengthened by the addition of staff of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  Legislation to disestablish the Council is being prepared.A key function of the new Office is to develop a new Strategy for Positive Ageing. The initial preparatory work for the Strategy has commenced.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The Slán Abhaile Scheme, now known as the Home Care Package Programme, formally commenced in 2006, following a pilot programme in 2005.  Home Care Packages are an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are used to maintain an older person at home via additional supports and therapy services.  They are designed to be flexible and are particularly targeted at those at risk of admission to long-term care, inappropriate admission to acute hospital or requiring discharge home from acute hospital.Very significant funding of €110 million was provided over the years 2006 and 2007 to develop Home Care Packages. In 2007, the Health Service Executive had put in place 4,350 packages, which benefitted in excess of 10,500 clients.In Budget 2008, an additional €10 million was allocated to provide 360 extra packages this year, which should benefit in the region of 800 additional people.  The Government specifically highlighted community based services for older people, and the expansion of Home Care Packages in particular, as a priority for development funding in the Budget. The total projected provision by the HSE is over 4,700 packages for this year, benefiting approximately 11,000 people.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	330	In accordance with the Health Service Executive's Medical Card/GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines, persons in receipt of the following allowances/benefits for a period of 12 months or more can retain their medical card for a period of three years from the date of taking up full-time employment:Job Seekers Allowance;Job Seekers Benefit;One Parent Family Payment;Illness Benefit;Disability Allowance;Blind Pension;Employment Incentive Schemes or Educational Opportunity Schemes.Such persons taking up part-time employment can retain their medical card for a period of three years from the date their income exceeds the relevant medical card guideline figure.Persons participating on the following Government Schemes retain eligibility for a medical card for the duration of the scheme:Back to Work Allowance;Back to Work Enterprise Allowance;Back to Education Allowance;Revenue Job Assist;Community Employment;VTOS;Job Initiative;Rural Social Scheme;Education, Training and Development Option;Community Services Programme;Part-time Job Incentive;Part-time education Option;FÁS (Non-craft courses);Youthreach;Local Employment Services Courses;Fáilte and Teagasc Courses;Wage Subsidy Scheme.A person moving from one scheme to another will retain eligibility to a medical card as long as they remain on one of the above schemes.Adult and child dependants of persons who retain their medical card either through receipt of specified allowances/benefits or participation on the above Government Schemes are also eligible for a medical card.The Programme for Government commits to allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years.  My Department is at present considering the most appropriate approach to the implementation of this commitment.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 215 together.The estimated additional cost of the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change' the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy is €150m over 7-10 years.  A total of  €51.2 million has been allocated since 2006 which represents over a third of the overall requirement.  In addition to the extra funding required to finance ‘A Vision for Change', existing resources need to be remodelled and reallocated.  It is clear that the implementation of the report is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources, than on new additional funding.  It is also clear that additional investment must be phased in parallel with the reorganisation of mental health services and resources.  In view of the significant additional investment in 2006 and 2007, it is necessary to pause and review the situation in 2008, to ensure consolidation of the investment to date.Substantial resources have been invested in mental health services.  Estimated expenditure in 2006 and 2007 was €984 million and €1 billion, respectively.  It is also important to bear in mind that some 90% of mental health services are provided at primary care level.  Expenditure on these services is not captured in the above figures.The Department of Health and Children has been advised by the HSE that €24 million of the €51.2 million development funding was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its overall Vote.  As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed; however, some of the mental health services funded in 2006 and 2007 will be put in place in 2008.  These include:the provision of 8 additional child and adolescent mental health teams; andthe provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents  at St. Anne's, Galway, St. Vincent's, Fairview, and St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork, to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008.The implementation of ‘A Vision for Change' will be a key priority for the recently established Office for Disability and Mental Health.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Statistics in relation to cancer incidence are collated by the National Cancer Registry.  My Department has asked the Director of the Registry to examine these matters and to reply directly to the Deputy.Statistics in relation to cancer deaths are collated by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  My Department has asked the CSO to examine these matters and to reply directly to the Deputy.Last September, the Government endorsed the establishment by the HSE of a National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) to manage, organise and deliver a national programme for the entire population, in line with the National Cancer Control Strategy approved by Government in June 2006.  Prof. Keane took up his post as National Cancer Control Director on 19 November 2007.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Tom Keane is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) was established on 1 January 2007 and will deliver both programmes nationally.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  BreastCheck commenced roll-out in the Western Region last May and in the Southern region last October.The roll out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer. The NCSS is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis and is in the final stages of preparations.The National Cancer Control Strategy does not recommend the introduction of a population based screening programme for prostate cancer as there is currently insufficient evidence available.  This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources.  The EU proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.  My Department and the National Cancer Screening Service will keep emerging international evidence under review including the results of randomised trials that are currently being conducted internationally.Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country.  Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.Cancer Research Ireland is an autonomous body within the framework of the Irish Cancer Society.  My Department does not have details of funding provided by Cancer Research Ireland.  However, I have been informed by the Health Research Board (HRB) that it co-funds a number of projects with the Irish Cancer Society as part of the Medical Research Council's co-funded research scheme.  In 2007 the HRB provided funding of over €800,000 to the Irish Cancer Society for nine projects, including two projects specific to prostate cancer.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) established an Expert Group on Colorectal Screening to prepare advice on the introduction of a national colorectal cancer programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, the type of test required and the requirements for a quality assured and well organised cost effective symptomatic service.The Expert Group was informed by screening programmes in place or planned in other countries, including the UK and Northern Ireland.  The Board has received this report and has commissioned a second report on options for service delivery, clinical cost effectiveness and the elements of a well organised and quality assured treatment service.  The Service has also requested the Health Information and Quality Authority to conduct a Health Technology Assessment on a colorectal screening programme.When the Board has assessed all of this advice it will report to me before the end of the year, at which stage I will consider the matter further.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The roll out of a national cervical screening programme is the most efficient population approach to preventing and controlling cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) is planning to roll out such a programme on a national basis and is in the final stages of preparations.  The service will be available free of charge to all eligible women in Ireland aged 25-60.  A national programme will provide screening in a primary care setting every three years for all women aged 25-44 years and screening every five years for women aged 45-60 years. The priority is to establish a national quality assured, organised cervical screening programme and it will be implemented in line with best international practice.All elements of the programme will be quality assured — call and recall, laboratory testing, colposcopy and will be managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  A cytology procurement process is underway. This process commenced in December 2007 and the outcome of this will be finalised shortly.The vital emphasis of the procurement process has been and will be on quality of the national programme and the necessary entry criteria in choosing a cytology partner included accreditation status and a laboratory dealing with a volume of a minimum of 25,000 smears per annum. These criteria were chosen in line with international acceptable criteria for cervical screening programmes.  The NCSS will ensure that the laboratory elements will be delivered in an efficient and cost effective manner and with high quality and acceptable turn-around time for results and so avoid unacceptably long delays for routine cervical smear test results as a priority.In advance of offering contracts to medical practitioners in primary care settings, the NCSS published a draft NCSS/Smeartaker contract and invited views and feedback concerning the contract on a non-privileged basis by the end of February 2008.  Many GPs, Smeartakers and representative bodies participated in this process and provided feedback.  The NCSS is in the final stages of discussions on agreement of this contract.

My Department is developing an appropriate regulatory framework for Assisted Human Reproduction services. This work involves, inter alia, examining the approaches to regulation in other jurisdictions — including the one mentioned by the Deputy — and considering the ethical and legal issues that arise. It will also take into account the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on this area — when completed — and any judgment of the Supreme Court in the RvR (frozen embryo) case.In addition, the European Communities (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations (Statutory Instrument No.158 of 2006) came into law on 7 April, 2006.  The Regulations apply to tissues establishments that are involved in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells intended for human applications.  Further Regulations (Statutory Instrument No. 598 of 2007) were signed on 31st August 2007 in respect of human tissues and cells traceability requirements, notification of serious adverse reactions and events and certain technical requirements.The aim of the Regulations is to ensure a high level of protection of human health.  The Regulations include criteria for assessing the status of prospective donors, inspection and control measures, traceability of donations and qualifications and training for persons working in tissue establishments.Fertility clinics are tissue establishments under the Regulations.   They must be inspected and authorised by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), which is the competent authority under the Regulations, to ensure that they meet quality and safety standards. The Regulations, which were made under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, gave effect to EU Directives 2004/23/EC, 2006/17/EC and 2006/86/EC. Regulations made under the 1972 Act cannot materially exceed the scope of the relevant Directives: the extension of the IMB's remit to include inspection of ethical or other matters similar to those which come within the remit of the United Kingdom's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) would require primary legislation.

It is intended that measures to tackle obesity and to promote good health will be advanced through the IDG.  My Department will be publishing our first National Nutrition Policy later this year. Recommendations will focus, primarily, on the nutrition needs of the 0-18 year age group.My Department and the Department of Education and Science have been involved in developing healthy eating guidelines for schools. Guidelines for preschools and primary schools are already developed and appropriate healthy eating training by community dieticians with preschool and primary school staff is currently underway.  Post-primary school guidelines will be launched in the coming weeks.  Guidelines on levels of physical activity are currently being devised by the Population Health Directorate of the Health Service Executive.The Chronic Disease Framework, which I launched on the 10th April 2008, acknowledges the burden of chronic disease and the need for an integrated approach on prevention to tackle lifestyle factors including obesity. The Cardiovascular Health Policy Group, due to report this summer, will also be advising on measures to tackle lifestyle issues like obesity, at population level as well as in the primary care setting.The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the recommendations of The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity, for which it has the lead responsibility.  A sum of €3 million was allocated for this purpose in 2006.  This in addition to the annual spend of €25 million on health promotion activities, €5 million of which is utilised in anti-obesity initiatives.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The government is taking a twin-track approach to tackling alcohol related harm, involving policies and interventions targeted at vulnerable populations and policies targeted at the population at large to reduce the overall level of alcohol misuse in society.  In this regard, initiatives are being taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to licensing laws with a view to reducing public disorder and further restrictions on advertising and marketing are also being introduced.  In addition, a working group, which includes the social partners, has been established to progress Action 80 of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 in relation to potential synergies between the alcohol and drug areas; it is anticipated that the working group will complete its report during the summer.In regard to drug misuse, the HSE is identified as the lead co-ordination agency for the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation published by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in May 2007.  The HSE's addiction service prioritises those under 18 years of age and, as resources permit, the HSE is implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Treatment for Under 18 year Olds Presenting to Treatment Services with Serious Drug Problems.In recent times, the HSE has re-oriented its addiction services to address the needs arising from changing patterns of drug use in the population e.g. poly drug use — including cocaine use.  While the Programme for Government indicated that two cocaine specific treatment centres would be opened, the available evidence indicates that many approaches already in use in general addiction services work well with cocaine misusers; accordingly, further consideration is being given to this issue.The HSE is also involved in developing community based stand-alone stimulant intervention services which includes additional training for its staff on issues such as cocaine and it is also re-engineering existing addiction services to meet emerging needs.The HSE is committed to implementing the rehabilitation strategy and will proceed this year to create and fill one post of senior co-ordinator for drugs rehabilitation.  This will enable the National Drug Rehabilitation Implementation Committee to be established and other preliminary work to commence which will build on existing drugs rehabilitation initiatives.The planning and development of a minimum of 25 detox. residential beds recommended in the Drugs Rehabilitation report will be addressed in conjunction with the recommendations contained in the HSE Report of the Working Group on Residential Treatment and Rehabilitation Services which addressed the needs for addiction and alcohol services on a national basis.  The planning for these beds, as revenue and staff are made available, will be carried out in the context of the mapping and analysis of existing services; prevalence data/trends; the phased priority planning of future service needs including taking account of the capacity of the voluntary sector and in the context of the HSE transformation programme.The HSE currently makes €91 million available for its drugs services overall: this includes an additional €6 million which was allocated for key priorities in Budget 2007.  In addition, the government also makes significant funding available through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for addiction-related initiatives of the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces and for the Young Person's Services and Facilities Fund.  This year approximately €64 million has been made available — an increase of 25% on the revised 2007 allocation.  The Young Persons Facilities and Services Fund, which has recently been expanded to include four additional urban areas (Dundalk, Arklow, Wexford and Athlone), has received an allocation of €24 million in 2008.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The launch of the National Recreation Policy last September highlighted Government's commitment to the development of youth cafés.As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth cafés in operation around the country. Funding for these existing initiatives is provided through a number of bodies including local City/County Council and Health Service Executive. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs also operate a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.At this stage, my focus is to bring better coherence to the approach taken to date, retaining the strong inter-agency element and identifying an appropriate model(s) for youth cafés for future developments. Since September my office has undertaken a small survey of some of the existing cafés looking at mission/objectives, management and organisation, service levels and the role of young people.  It also requested the National Children's Advisory Council's advice on the development of a youth café model and research work has been commissioned by the Council in this regard.  I am anticipating the Council will be in a position to report to me shortly.  This work will guide government in ensuring that funding is targeted and co-ordinated most effectively on a model or models of youth cafés which meet the needs identified by young people themselves. Discussions are also underway with my Cabinet colleagues regarding a youth café programme and appropriate funding mechanisms. I am considering which agency could best lead on the programme and how to ensure any funding which might be made available augments, without displacing, the existing inter-agency resources.

In November 2006 my Department established an Implementation Group in order to progress implementation of the 29 actions, across a range of sectors, identified in this Report. The purpose of the Implementation Group was to monitor and report on progress on the implementation of the actions identified in the Working Group's Report.  The Implementation Group met throughout 2007 and in early 2008 and its Report is due to be published shortly.  The Report of the Implementation Group will outline the progress made to date and identify where continued progress is needed in order to deliver on the commitment in the Programme for Government.

Insofar as the Health Sector is concerned, the Health Service Executive is developing protocols for the roll out of brief intervention programmes to detect high risk and harmful drinking in individuals before or shortly after the early signs of alcohol related problems on a pilot basis in the acute hospital services. The HSE is also working with the Irish College of General Practitioners in building capacity for general practitioners to use brief intervention programmes.

(The Regulations reduced the level of fluoride in public water supplies to between 0.6 parts per million (ppm) and 0.8 ppm). This baseline study, which will be carried out with the assistance of the HSE, will facilitate the undertaking of the study which is referred to in the Programme for Government.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists in 2006 made recommendations on strengthening the regulatory environment for complementary therapists including voluntary self-regulation for the majority of therapists and statutory regulation for Acupuncturists, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners and Herbal practitioners.To support the development of robust voluntary self-regulation, the Report of the National Working Group outlined guidance for professional associations and provided examples of codes of ethics and good practice, including grievance and disciplinary procedures.  In addition, this Department has facilitated the provision of work days.  The purpose of these days is for different therapists to come together to undertake a process of harmonisation and development with regard to common basic standards of practice, education and training.  In addition, these facilitated work days provide a forum for greater cohesion within each therapy.  Work days were organised in 2007 for a number of the higher risk therapies as categorised in the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists i.e. acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, herbal medicine, aromatherapy and homeopathy.In addition to the above, an Information Guide for the Public has been produced offering guidance for members of the public when choosing to see a complementary therapist.The certification of complementary therapy training courses was also recommended in the Report of the National Working Group on the Regulation of Complementary Therapists.  In this regard, I understand that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) are developing standards for complementary therapy education courses.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 219 to 221, inclusive, together.In September 2005, "Reach Out" — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched. The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The actions identified in this strategy are consistent with the commitments in the Programme for Government.The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children regarding the "High Levels of Suicide in Irish Society" which are consistent with the actions identified in "Reach Out".One of the key components of the overall strategy aimed at reducing suicide include the implementation of measures aimed at high risk groups, provision of information and training on suicide prevention to relevant professionals and organisations, research on suicide prevention and the improvement of services which would benefit those at risk of suicide and those who attempt suicide.Additional funding of €1.85 million was provided in 2007 for the implementation of the Strategy bringing the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.Initiatives funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention include developing and implementing national training programmes, completing the availability of self-harm services through A&E departments, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services, eleven dedicated suicide officers, supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention and developing mental health awareness campaigns.The promotion of positive mental health contributes significantly to combating ignorance and stigma which often surrounds mental illness.  In 2007, two national mental health awareness campaigns were launched.  In October 2007, Minister Devins launched the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention's Mental Health Awareness Campaign "Your Mental Health".  The main aim of this campaign is to influence public attitudes to mental health and is specifically designed to alter negative attitudes and to promote positive attitudes and a greater understanding of mental health.  In addition, in December 2007, Minister Devins launched the National Disability Authority's advertising campaign "Challenging Attitudes to Mental Health", which is designed to challenge negative perceptions about people with mental health problems.The NOSP Annual Report includes details on initiatives and statistics etc. including research activities funded.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 to 195, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, I established a Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in January last year.  The overall objective of the Commission is to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure the quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system.  The Commission has been asked to develop proposals for ensuring clear responsibility among senior management and clinical leaders within the health system for performance in relation to quality and patient safety.  In addition, one of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services.Membership of the Commission is made up of medical and nursing representatives, management representatives and representatives of patients and carers.  The Commission is due to report on its proposals by July 2008.As part of the process involved in considering the proposals of the Commission, a legislative review of the area of patient safety and quality will be undertaken to establish what changes may be necessary to give effect to the Commission's recommendations.  The Commission is also examining and making recommendations on the participation of patients and carers and support staff in engaging with health care providers on health services planning and the quality of care received.  In line with this engagement with patients and carers I intend to ensure that the safety of patients and the delivery of high quality in healthcare services will be at the forefront of any legislative change.

The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.Out-of-hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  The HSE, which has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, has advised that almost €37 million is available to fund the operation of GP out-of-hours services in 2008.  This figure does not include the fees of the participating doctors.A review of the GMS and other publicly funded schemes involving general practitioners is being conducted by the HSE.  The review will have regard to the relevant commitments in the Programme for Government.

This includes operational responsibility for the establishment of Primary Care Teams.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

A Steering Group has been established which is expected to complete this work in autumn 2008.  It is my intention to then consider how best to progress the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to medical card eligibility.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	382	In 2001 the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145, based on returns to the Department (11,374 in-patient beds and 771 day places).  The provisional number of acute hospital beds recorded by the Health Service Executive for 2006 was 13,771(12,574 in-patient beds and 1,197 day places) based on a total bed complement.This represents an increase of over 1,600, an average of some 325 new bed and day places per year, a very high level of annual increase by historic standards.  The figures indicate the number of in-patient beds alone has increased by 1,200, an average of 240 per year over five years.The Government in 2001 made a commitment, in the context of the Health Strategy Quality and Fairness, to increase public acute hospital bed numbers by 3,000 over ten years.  This commitment included both acute in-patient beds and day places.  With current plans and developments since 2001, it is substantially on target to be met.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds.  About 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location initiative and the balance through the HSE's capital plan.  The co-location initiative aims to make available additional acute beds for public patients through the transfer of private activity from public hospitals to co-located private hospitals.The Board of the HSE has approved successful bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals at the following six hospitals:Waterford Regional Hospital;Cork University Hospital;Limerick Regional Hospital;Sligo Regional Hospital;Beaumont Hospital;St James's Hospital.The Project Agreements for Beaumont, Cork and Limerick Hospitals have recently been signed.It is expected that the signing of the Project Agreements for the other three sites (Waterford, Sligo and St. James's ) will be concluded shortly.Connolly Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, which are also participating in the co-location initiative, are at an earlier stage of the procurement process.  A tender in relation to Connolly Hospital is under consideration and it is expected that the invitation to tender (ITT) for Tallaght Hospital will issue in the near future.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to provide detailed information to the Deputy regarding the provision of the additional acute beds under the Executive's capital plan.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 and 204 together.The National Patient Treatment Register is an online register of patients on in-patient and day cases, compiled and maintained by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  Patients, general practitioners and hospitals can access up-to-date information on the waiting-time for some 7,500 procedures through the PTR website www.ptr.ie.  The NTPF has informed me that it will be undertaking further work in 2008 to develop and manage this information source.The NTPF has made significant inroads into lowering waiting-times.  For the most common procedures, the median waiting-time is now down to 2 to 4 months for adults and 2 to 5 months for children.  The overall median wait time for all specialties is 3.5 months. The NTPF continues to work to reduce the waiting-time for surgery and a particular objective in 2008 is to eliminate the cohort of patients waiting longer than 12 months.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 to 207, inclusive, together.Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services continues to be a high priority for this Government.There has been considerable improvement made in the delivery of services in Emergency Departments over the past two years.  The average monthly number of patients awaiting admission fell from 179 in 2005 to 92 in 2007.  While there has been some increase in the figures to date in 2008 it should be stressed that the remaining difficulties are largely confined to a number of major hospitals.  The HSE is working closely with these hospitals to bring about further improvements.  The HSE focus is on improving and streamlining hospital processes and patient pathways to ensure that care is provided in a more timely, appropriate and efficient manner.The Programme for Government contains a number of new commitments designed to further improve the delivery of Accident & Emergency services.  These are to:Increase the number of A and E consultants available around the clock in A and E departments;Further develop chest pain and respiratory clinics to ease pressure on A and E;Establish a national network of Local Injury Clinics.The 100 + Scheme was introduced last year by the HSE to reward hospitals with Emergency Departments operating in line with established performance targets.  Phase 1 of the Scheme involved the announcement last August of 60 consultant posts to be distributed across 24 hospitals and including posts in emergency medicine, radiology, general medicine, general surgery and geriatric medicine.  An additional 20 Consultants in Emergency Medicine have been approved to support the delivery of A and E services since 2003.  This represents an increase of 61% over the past five years in the emergency consultant numbers.  A further 2 posts were advertised in April and the Health Service Executive expects to progress more emergency consultant posts during 2008 in the context of the 100 + Scheme.In addition, the proposed new Consultant Contract provides for greater flexibility in the rostering of Consultants in Emergency Medicine and the consequent availability of consultant-provided services in line with clinical need.  The new Contract includes provision for an extended working day to 12 hours Monday to Friday (8 a.m. to 8 p.m.), provision for rostering on-site at weekends and public holidays and by agreement, more flexible arrangements, including 24/7 rostering.Significant capital provision has been included by the HSE within its Draft Capital Plan 2008-2013 for the enhancement of A and E facilities in line with the recommendations of the Emergency Task Force.  The funding will be targeted at upgrading and extending existing departments and will also include provision for new departments.Chest pain assessment and respiratory services are provided at existing Emergency Departments. However, there are dedicated practice examples where GP referrals are assessed by cardiology services in units such as the chest pain assessment units in the Mater Hospital, Connolly Hospital, Cork University Hospital and South Infirmary. Dedicated respiratory clinics are, for example, conducted at the Mater Hospital and Connolly.A number of the new A and E Departments have provision for minor injury clinics, including Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Cork University Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, St. James's Hospital and South Tipperary General Hospital.Outside of Dublin, funding was provided for the expansion of minor injuries services at St. John's Limerick, and the provision of a minor injuries unit at Waterford Regional Hospital.  These services are fully operational.In line with the recommendations of the Teamwork Report "Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards", the HSE is also committed to the development of Minor Injury Units in local hospitals in the North East.  The first of these units is to be developed at Monaghan Hospital. Other units are to open at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 to 212, inclusive, together.Tackling all Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).The HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  Work has already been advanced on producing and promoting guidelines on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals and it is planned that this will be extended, in due course, to community and primary care settings.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.At a European level, the European Antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) was established in 1999 in response to the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance in Europe.  EARSS comprises a network of over 800 microbiological laboratories serving some 1,200 hospitals in 30 countries that collects routinely generated antimicrobial susceptibility testing data on invasive infections caused by seven important bacterial pathogens.  As of final quarter of 2007, 44 Irish laboratories serving 65 acute hospitals (public and private) participate in EARSS representing 100% coverage of the Irish population.In quarter 4 of 2007, 28.8% of Staphylococcus Aureus isolates were Methicillin resistant compared to 40% in quarter 3 of 2007.  This is a statistically significant difference.  The annual trends indicate that the portion of MRSA in Ireland levelled off at approximately 42% between 2002 and 2006.  In 2007, preliminary data indicate that this has dropped to 38.5%.If the trend for 2008 remains downwards, it will indicate that our policies relating to control of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in Ireland are having a positive impact.In 2006, 52 posts were approved by the HSE to enhance infection control in the country's hospitals.  These posts included Senior Pharmacists, Senior Infection Control Nurses and Surveillance Scientists.  To date, a total of 34.5 WTE (whole-time equivalent) positions have been filled.  Efforts are being made to fill the remaining 17.5 infection control staff posts as soon as possible but the availability of suitably qualified people for specific locations is proving somewhat more difficult.A new National Surveillance System has recently been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor HCAIs in our health system:1. Staphylococcus bacteraemia (blood stream infections);2. Antibiotic consumption;3. Alcohol gel use;4. MRSA Surveillance in Intensive Care Units.The HSE intend to publish available data on the above for 2006 and 2007 in the near future and then quarterly thereafter.The availability of isolation facilities is another important factor in the overall solution to the issue of reducing incidence of infection.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract HCAIs and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.  New environmental building guidelines have also been prepared by the HSE to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments.  It is expected that these guidelines will be published in June.The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertook a comprehensive review of hygiene in our acute hospitals in 2007.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  The review provided a detailed assessment of performance across the entire range of areas that impact hygiene.  This allows individual hospitals identify strengths and areas for improvement.  Hospitals generally performed well on hygiene in the service delivery area, however the results on governance were poor. While good hygiene practice of front-line staff highlighted in the report is vital, real improvement in this whole area also depends heavily on good leadership and a system of governance to ensure that efforts at identifying, managing and reducing infection are sustained and successful over time.  HIQA is following up on this review to ensure that deficits identified during that process are rectified and the Authority will be undertaking a further national review this Autumn.In addition, HIQA, in conjunction with major stakeholders, is currently in the process of producing infection prevention and control standards.  It is hoped that these standards will be ready for publication by mid-2008.  When completed these, along with the national hygiene standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to help reduce the spread of infection and improve the quality of our health care.In relation to financial incentives for achieving excellence, while it is a matter for the Health Service Executive to decide on funding priorities, I favour, of course, the allocation by the Executive of resources to best ensure the delivery of high quality services.I expect to receive the report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance in July which will comment on, amongst other matters, licensing.  It will be appreciated that I am not in a position to comment on the report until I receive its recommendations.

I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static units in Galway and Cork last December.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Southern region covers counties Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the West covers counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.An additional €26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of the two new clinical static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of €15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is underway.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	387	A capital sum in excess of €500m has been provided for the implementation of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology, through a mix of traditional procurement and Public Private Partnership.The implementation of the National Cancer Control Programme is a key priority for Government.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant realignment of services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.Rapid developments are taking place in the field of Health Technology particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging which provides a better biological and molecular understanding of diseases including cancers.  The HSE allocates capital funding targeted at providing new equipment such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners and additional MRI and CT scanners as identified by need assessments.  In addition, capital funding is also provided to upgrade and replace diagnostic equipment such as MRI, CT scanners, radiology equipment etc.  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy with further details relating to individual capital projects.In relation to the BreastCheck breast screening programme, an additional €26.7 million capital funding was provided for the construction of the two new clinical static units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  There are now 4 static units, 2 in Dublin, with the others in Galway and Cork.A key part of the National Cancer Control Programme is the National Radiation Oncology Project, which consists of: four large centres at St James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and Galway University Hospital and two integrated satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick to be managed by the Cork and Galway Hospitals respectively.

The Executive, therefore, is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	389	To qualify as a clinical psychologist, a post-graduate qualification in clinical psychology must be completed after an initial undergraduate degree in psychology.Post-graduate students are sponsored by health agencies and spend time over three years in clinical placements in different specialities; course work and a thesis must be also satisfactorily completed.For some years the Health Service Executive has been committed to developing the number of postgraduate training places for clinical psychology nationally.  In 2003, the total training places available nationally was 54.  At that time, clinical psychology training opportunities were available at UCD and TCD only.  Since then, facilitated through a partnership initiative involving the HSE and four National Universities — TCD, UCD, UL and NUIG — the number of clinical psychologists in training has doubled to 110 training places.Within the HSE, a Working Group continues to examine the issue of training places and I am advised that the Executive aims to bring the total number nationally to 150 by the year 2009.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	390	A Vision for Change — the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy,  provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  Recommendations in the Report are consistent with the commitment in the Programme for Government.The Report proposes a holistic view of mental illness and recommends an integrated multidisciplinary approach to addressing the biological, psychological and social factors that contribute to mental health problems.  It recognises that responding to children's mental health needs can be conceptualised at different levels, ranging from early intervention and health promotion programmes, to primary and community care services and specialist mental heath services for the treatment of complex disorders.Implementation of  A Vision for Change is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  A total of €11.2 million funding has been provided to the HSE in 2006 and 2007 for the development of child and adolescent mental health services.  It is noted that the HSE has prioritised the development of child and adolescent services in 2008; these developments include the recruitment of 8 additional Child and Adolescent Community Mental Health teams.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The scheme referred to by the Deputy would not fall under the direct remit of my Department.  However, the National Development Plan which gives effect to many of the commitments contained in ‘Towards 2016' recognised older people as one of the main groups at risk from social exclusion.The supports for minimising social exclusion among older people relates to a wide range of measures in the National Development Plan, including for example the Social Inclusion, Social Infrastructure and Human Capital Chapters.  The key initiatives insofar as my Department is concerned relates to the Living at Home Sub Programme which provides for some €4.7 billion investment over the period of the Plan.  In this regard, the recent Budget provided €22 million for a range of expanded community-based services  this year including Home Care Packages, Home Helps and Respite Care.I have referred the Deputy's question to the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy with the current position in relation to these measures.The recently established Office for Older People intends to progress the Strategy on Positive Ageing and would be prepared to assist in whatever way appropriate on issues relating to combating social isolation.

The legislation is complex and requires careful drafting in order to ensure that the interests of older people requiring residential care are fully protected.  In the course of progressing the legislation, the Department has received legal advice in relation to a number of matters.  Some of these matters are still the subject of consideration in the context of finalising the Bill. It would not be appropriate to comment further until the Bill has been brought before the Government for approval.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Under the Programme for Government, the Government has committed to removing the regional disparities in the provision and funding of palliative care, and to ensuring that the needs of all those who require palliative care are met. Funding is being used to improve palliative care services in consultation with the newly established Regional Development Committees and in line with the recommendations made in the report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (October 2001).Additional funding totalling €18 million was provided by the Government in Budgets 2006 and 2007. Budget 2008 provided a further €3m for enhanced service provision covering Multi-Disciplinary Teams; Specialist Palliative Care Beds; Home Care; Day Care; Acute Palliative Care Services, etc.  Particular emphasis will be placed by the HSE on addressing parts of the country where services need most improvement (South East; Midlands; North East; West).On the 14th September 2007, officials from the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive met with representatives of the Irish Hospice Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Association for Palliative Care. At that meeting it was agreed to develop a five year implementation framework for the delivery of palliative care services. Work towards developing this framework is currently being progressed by the HSE with significant involvement from the voluntary sector. It is intended that it will be complete by the middle of the year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	394	The provision of third-level medical education, including undergraduate medical school places, is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe T.D., advised by the Higher Education Authority.Government policy, based on the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training (Fottrell) and the Report of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Group (Buttimer), published in February 2006, provides for the number of medical school places for EU students to be increased from 305 to 725.  This will be made up of a new graduate entry stream, which will provide an additional 240 EU medical school places per annum on the basis of 60 per year over a 4 year period, and increasing the number of EU undergraduate places to 485 on the basis of substitution of 180 non-EU places.A total of 170 extra medical school places have been provided between 2006 and 2007 for Irish/EU students in the existing undergraduate courses and in the new graduate entry programme (110 undergraduate places and 60 graduate entry places).  A further 95 places (35 undergraduate places and 60 graduate entry places) will be made available in 2008 with the remaining 155 places (35 undergraduate places and 120 graduate entry places) coming on stream over the next 2 years.The reforms in medical education which have been agreed with the universities and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland include a new entry mechanism to undergraduate medical education to be introduced from 2009 to replace the current selection system.The plan, approved by Government, provides for an expansion of intern posts from 2011 to accommodate an eventual 240 EU places from the new graduate entry stream.  There are currently sufficient numbers of intern posts in the health service to place any Irish/EU students graduating in the next 3 years.The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides the statutory basis for many of the reforms proposed in the Buttimer Report including phasing out non-consultant hospital doctors posts of limited training value.The Health Service Executive Medical Education, Training and Research Unit (HSE-METR) has been co-ordinating the funding flow and implementation of the Buttimer Report recommendations in the area of postgraduate medical education and training since 2006.Progress on the reform of postgraduate medical education and training includes: two research scholarships awarded by the HSE in 2007 to medical trainees; eight scholarships under the HSE's newly established programme of training abroad for specialist registrars and senior registrars (the "HSE-Dr. Richard Steevens Scholarship"); the 13 postgraduate Training Bodies have begun the process of developing generic modules and team working in a multidisciplinary context; the postgraduate Training Bodies are investigating international best practice to develop competency-based assessment, as opposed to time-based progression.  This will assist in addressing the duration of training as well as affording greater opportunities to those in posts with limited training value; a capital audit of medical education and training facilities has recommended that any investment in facilities should provide for appropriate multidisciplinary use of on-site and off-site facilities, to maximise value-for-money.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator K.P.M.G. and McCann Fitzgerald.The HSE has advised my Department that there are a number of reasons for successful appeals where initially  a lower amount had been offered and a higher amount was issued on appeal.The HSE has advised my Department that in some cases it is because applicants bring forward additional relevant information during the appeals process which would not have been in the possession of the scheme administrator when processing the original claim.  In other cases either the records contained information in relation to the payee rather than the patient. In a very small number of cases, the absence of official records with regard to patient stays which created challenges for the processing of claims have been resolved through the appeals mechanism.As of 2 May,  11,108 claimants are deemed  to be outside the scope of the repayment scheme and of these, 2,285 have appealed the decision of the scheme administrator. 13,578 offers of payment have issued under the scheme and of these, 650 have appealed the amount offered.  A total of 2,935 appeals have been lodged, which represents approximately 12% of processed claims.Of the 1,293 appeals dealt with to 9 May, 122 of the decisions issued by the appeals office disagree with the scheme administrator's decision to reject the claim and 171 disagree with the amount offered by the scheme administrator.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 231 together.The national disability strategy, which was launched in September 2004, provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities. The Strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in several pieces of equality legislation. The main elements of the Strategy are: The Disability Act 2005; The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004; Six Outline Sectoral Plans published by Government Departments; The Citizens Information Act 2007; A Multi-Annual Investment Package, totalling some €900 million over the period 2006-2009.The Disability Act 2005 is one of the central elements of the Strategy. Part 2 of the Act sets down a range of statutory entitlements which are designed to underscore the engagement of people with disabilities with everyday life. In particular, Part 2 provides a statutory entitlement to: An independent assessment of health and education needs; A statement of services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide; Pursue a complaint through the Health Service Executive complaints process if necessary; Make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June 2007. This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. The arrangements for Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 cannot be considered in isolation from the arrangements for the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004, which is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science, and which provides for educational services for people with disabilities.The Department of Education and Science has informed the Department that it is envisaged that all sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 will be implemented over a five year timeframe, with the assessment process as provided for in the EPSEN Act 2004 due to commence in 2010. It is proposed that Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act 2004. In preparation for its implementation, health related support services for children aged 5 to 18 and adults will continue to be enhanced to enable the Health Service Executive to meet needs identified for this group.The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be extended to adults as soon as possible, but no later than 2011.A Cross-Sectoral team comprising the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education was established and meets on a regular basis and continues to address issues arising in relation to the implementation of both Acts. A sub-group of this team was set up in January 2008, in order to plan for the commencement  of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 in respect of children aged 5 to 18 and adults.

It also provides assessments for wheelchair and mobility aids and vocational training programmes involving a wide range of social, personal and work related skills. In addition, the hospital has a 12 bed hostel which enables patients from outside the Dublin area to access day services at the hospital and attend the vocational training unit.The Programme for Government committed to increasing the existing rehabilitation capacity in addition to redeveloping the NRH.  I understand that a Project Team is working with an appointed Design Team to develop the new hospital. The design will be submitted for planning in mid 2008 with an expected completion date for the hospital of 2012. When built, the new hospital will provide additional treatment and diagnostic capacity.In addition the Health Service Executive has also informed my Department that plans have been prepared to develop a satellite unit of the National Rehabilitation Hospital attached to Beaumont Hospital, linking the rehabilitation expertise of NRH with the neurological services in Beaumont.  This new proposed unit will provide acute medical rehabilitation services and early rehabilitation for those suffering from brain injury who access the National Neurosciences Unit at Beaumont Hospital and who currently have to access services at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.A key Government initiative in the area of rehabilitation is the commitment by the Department of Health & Children and the HSE to the development of a national strategy for the provision of medical rehabilitation services.  A number of issues will be considered as part of this including: an assessment of the need; the structure and location of facilities and services; and the nature of the rehabilitation facilities, that is, whether they should be hospital type, step down, or preparation for independent living.Preliminary meetings in relation to this strategy will be held in the coming weeks.

This will be made up of a new graduate entry stream, which will provide an additional 240 EU medical school places per annum on the basis of 60 per year over a 4 year period, and increasing the number of EU undergraduate places to 485 on the basis of substitution of 180 non-EU places.A total of 170 extra medical school places have been provided between 2006 and 2007 for Irish/EU students in the existing undergraduate courses and in the new graduate entry programme (110 undergraduate places and 60 graduate entry places).  A further 95 places (35 undergraduate places and 60 graduate entry places) will be made available in 2008 with the remaining 155 places (35 undergraduate places and 120 graduate entry places) coming on stream over the next 2 years.A new medical school has been established at the University of Limerick, bringing the total number of medical schools to six.  The programme of graduate entry to medicine, which commenced in 2007, has provided 30 EU graduate entry places at the University of Limerick.  An additional 20 EU graduate entry places will be provided in 2008 with a further 45 EU graduate entry places planned over the next 2 years.  This will bring the total number of EU graduate entry places that will be available in the University of Limerick to 95.The plan, approved by Government, provides for an expansion of intern posts from 2011 to accommodate an eventual 240 EU places from the new graduate entry stream.  There are currently sufficient numbers of intern posts in the health service to place any Irish/EU students graduating in the next 3 years.Appointments of doctors to work in the Irish health service are made by the Health Service Executive and the public voluntary hospitals concerned.  Vacancies for medical personnel are advertised in the public press and in the appropriate medical journals, including the classified section of the British Medical Journal.

In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.The assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is statutorily a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and, with the exception of persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card, is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

Luas Line BX runs from St. Stephen's Green to O'Connell St., while Luas Line D is the onward extension of the line from O'Connell St. to Liffey Junction.I recently mandated the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to proceed with planning the delivery of Line BX/D, based on the Agency's preferred route for Line BX and the use of the Old Broadstone railway alignment for Line D.It will not be possible to fully construct Luas Line BX at the same time as construction of Metro North because of the traffic management implications which would arise in the city centre.  The RPA is developing a construction strategy for Luas Line BX, in close co-operation with Dublin City Council, which includes use of Metro North construction sites and recognises the traffic management requirements of the city centre.In addition, the RPA is currently exploring the options for optimising the design of the connection of the two lines.  This is being done on the basis that Line D will be developed contemporaneously with Line BX.  The RPA is engaging with Dublin City Council on the basis that it is its intention to make a single railway order application for the combined Line BX — D to An Bord Pleanála in the latter part of next year.I understand from the RPA that public consultation on Line D route options will commence this summer, with identification of a preferred route option likely later this year.

Generally, congested airports will be designated as ‘co-ordinated' which means that a carrier cannot operate a landing or a take-off at such an airport without being allocated a slot.  A more flexible regime can be operated at ‘schedules facilitated' airports where capacity is not so constrained.The key point is that slots are allocated to carriers and carriers are free to decide what routes to operate using the slots which have been allocated to them in accordance with the Regulation except in the specific case where slots are assigned for the purpose of operating a route which is the subject of public service obligation.The application of Regulation (EEC) No. 95/93 in Ireland is concerned only with the allocation of slots to carriers at Irish airports and Dublin airport is the only airport in the State that has been designated as a ‘co-ordinated' airport by the Commission for Aviation Regulation which is the competent authority for the Regulation in Ireland.  The slot allocation process at airports in other Member States is entirely a matter for the authorities of each individual Member State.One of the most substantive clarifications in the European Commission's Communication is that secondary trading of slots between air carriers is acceptable under the Regulation.  This clarification is based on an acknowledgement that secondary trading in slots has been taking place at a number of congested airports in the Community and the Commission has stated that if it becomes apparent that, for competition or other reasons, revision of the existing legislation is required, they will make an appropriate proposal.When Aer Lingus was publicly floated, specific measures were introduced into the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company to make provision for shareholders to have a role in any proposed disposal of slots at Heathrow airport.  In effect these provisions provide for the possibility that a sale of Heathrow slots can be blocked. The operation of these provisions is not changed as a result of the Commission's communication.

The ultimate capacity will be 20,000 passengers per hour based on 30 trains per hour.DARTFollowing refurbishment of the fleet later this year, the capacity of the DART will be 9,800 passengers per hour northbound and 8,400 per hour southbound. The northbound figure is based on 7 trains per hour, each train having a capacity of 1,400 passengers. The southbound figure is based on 6 services per hour.  Following completion of the Interconnector project, the capacity southbound will increase to 22,400 passengers per hour based on 16 trains per hour and the northbound capacity will increase to 14,000 passengers per hour based on 10 trains per hour.In comparing the capacity of each mode, it is important to recognise their different characteristics. For example, the DART's capacity is constrained by the fact that it is sharing line capacity with intercity and outer suburban services. The Luas capacity is constrained by on street operation with other traffic. Metro North, on the other hand, is completely separated from other road and rail traffic and can therefore currently provide a higher capacity than the other two modes.

This function was transferred to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) on its establishment in December 1993.The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has advised me that they assess applications for planning permission in order to protect the safe operation of aircraft. In the event of any development impinging on air navigation safety, the IAA would recommend to the relevant planning authority against the granting of planning permission.

Funding provided to these groups in 2006 totalled €239,000, while a total of €304,000 was provided in 2007.As part of a process to extend the Rural Transport Programme on a phased basis funding has also been provided to the Inishowen Partnership to support them to develop a transport project plan for the Inishowen Peninsula.Under Transport 21, Donegal regional airport will receive €3.8 million for projects aimed at providing enhanced levels of safety and security.  In addition, major investment has also been made in the national roads programme in the county including the N15 Ballyshannon — Bundoran Bypass, which forms part of the Atlantic Road Corridor, and the N56 Mountaintop to Illistrin.However, under Section 19 of the Roads Act 1993 allocation of funding in relation to the construction or maintenance of national roads is a matter for the NRA.Further investment in road improvements on other parts of the N15 and the N56 will be made during Transport 21.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 270 together.The Government continues to attach the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States. The former Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahern T.D., strongly emphasised this commitment during his address to the US Congress on 30 April.During the visit of the former Taoiseach to Washington, my predecessor, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D., participated in his meetings with President Bush, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Edward Kennedy. On 1 May, Minister Ahern had a further series of meetings with key Congressional and Administration figures to press the case for finding a solution for our undocumented. Among those he met were: Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Chair of the House Sub-Committee on Immigration; Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Congressman Jim Walsh and Ms Paula Dobriansky, Under-Secretary of State and Special Envoy to Northern Ireland.My predecessor also had a constructive and forward looking meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I look forward to working closely with ILIR on this important issue.Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative options.However, achieving progress on immigration reform at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. The political reality in the United States is that immigration has become a divisive political issue. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 12 million undocumented.Despite these considerable political challenges, the Government will continue to press for change. We will work closely with our friends in Congress, with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, and with the many organisations who have worked hard on behalf of the undocumented in the Irish community, with a view to trying to find a way forward which would remedy the very difficult situation in which our undocumented find themselves.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I am aware of the reports of recent prison riots in Colorado, U.S.A. According to media reports, guards at a high-security penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, shot and killed two inmates at a federal prison on 20 April 2008 after up to 200 inmates battled with homemade weapons in a fight that appeared to be racially motivated. One of the group known as the Miami 5 is detained in this prison. However, he was not involved in the riots.The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9th August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Following an appellate hearing on 14 February 2006, a 10-2 decision to uphold the 2001 convictions was issued on 9 August 2006.It is my understanding that a number of appeals lodged on behalf of the defendants remain under active judicial review within the framework of the US domestic legal system. As the Deputy has been advised previously, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to pursue this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I am deeply concerned by the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis in Burma/Myanmar on 2 and 3 May. The scale of destruction is almost unimaginable. Completely accurate figures are not available, but there are estimates that more than 100,000 people have perished, with tens of thousands more missing. One and a half million people are without adequate shelter and are facing shortages of basic foodstuffs and water.The Government of Burma/Myanmar has requested international assistance to deal with this catastrophe. The international community has moved quickly, with UN agencies on the ground, including the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as teams from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and a number of NGOs.However, this positive international response has been severely hampered by restrictions imposed by the Burmese government. I am deeply concerned at the delays this has caused in the receipt of aid where it is most needed. I would strongly urge the Burmese Government quickly to facilitate access for international relief agencies, to ensure that all the people affected by this catastrophe can receive the assistance they urgently require. I would also appeal to those countries which have influence on the Burmese Government to urgently make this case. In this regard, Ireland has urged concerted action within the EU vis-à-vis Burma’s neighbours.The Government has made an initial pledge of up to €1 million for emergency relief in Burma/Myanmar. This will be channelled through established partners in emergency response, such as NGOs, UN Agencies and the Red Cross. It is important to work through agencies that are already on the ground as they have the experience, contacts and local information to be most effective. Clearly, we are ready to respond further and quickly.In addition to the pledged funding, Irish Aid humanitarian supplies — plastic sheeting for temporary shelter, mosquito nets, kitchen sets and blankets — to the value of over €62,000 sent from our pre-positioned supplies in Brindisi, Italy, landed in Yangon on 11 May. We stand ready to provide more supplies, if requested by our partners on the ground and if access arrangements permit. Our Rapid Response Corps has also been put on stand-by for deployment.Ireland is a strong supporter of the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Red Cross Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). Both Funds have released money to facilitate a speedy response to the current crisis in Burma/Myanmar. In 2008, Ireland contributed €22.6 million to the CERF and €2 million to the DREF.Officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with our partners who have a presence on the ground in Burma in order to obtain regularly updated information on the extent of the crisis and the needs of affected communities, and to keep me fully briefed on the developing situation.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Unemployment has increased by only 15,200 in the three-year period since 2004 and must be seen in the context of the substantial increase in employment by 242,500 in the same period.  The number of people currently in employment is 2,138,900.  It is generally accepted that the strong rate of growth experienced over the past few years could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.Over the period of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, the Government will invest €7.7 billion in public funds to support training and skills development. This is a significant increase when compared with the level of spending over the previous seven year period (2000-2006) of €5.9 billion. The current level of investment reflects the importance the Government attaches to developing and maintaining an educated, skilled and adaptable work force in Ireland.As part of this strategy, FÁS provides a range of services to the unemployed with particular emphasis on those who may have difficulty in accessing the labour market such as people with disabilities, women returnees and early school leavers. The focus is on the provision of training and employment programmes, which will assist these groups to enter or re-enter the labour market or progress to further job-related training.In addition, FÁS provides an integrated support service for anyone made redundant. This involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/retraining courses and job placement.  In the delivery of these services, FÁS liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the City/County Enterprise Boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  FÁS also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I am committed to working with my counterparts in Northern Ireland to implement North/South initiatives where there is mutual economic benefit. The North/South Ministerial Council provides the opportunity to work with my counterparts in Northern Ireland to advance initiatives for the North West and the all-island economy.There is well-established co-operation between my Department and its agencies with their Northern counterparts to enhance economic development. The North West Gateway Initiative is a major joint response to the development needs of the region, which includes enhancing the skills and infrastructure to attract inward investment and foster the growth of the indigenous enterprise sector. A significant joint initiative between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland is the North-West Business and Technology Zone, which is receiving substantial INTERREG funding to develop a world-class environment for technology-oriented enterprises in Letterkenny and Derry. Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland are also jointly running a Cross Border Enterprise Incubation Programme known as the Transform- Ideas into Businesses Programme.FÁS and the Northern Ireland Department for Employment and Learning have developed ongoing cooperation at both official and project levels through a variety of cross-border initiatives. For example, these initiatives include the North West Workforce Development Forum, which was set up to examine the skills needs of the North West's economy, identify growth sectors and develop a strategy for the region. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and the Northern Ireland Skills Expert Group intend to produce an All-Island Statement of Skills Demand and to organise an All-Island skills conference this year. I understand that work is progressing well on both these initiatives.A ‘Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy', which was completed in 2006, identified a number of areas where co-ordinated North/South policy intervention would prove beneficial to both jurisdictions on this island. The areas identified included co-operation on trade and investment promotion, research and development and the development of the knowledge economy, education and training systems to enhance human capital, and co-ordinated provision of key transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure. The National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out a detailed and specific agenda for progressing such co-operation. Work is underway to progress these initiatives, which will also enhance economic development in the Border counties.The North/South Ministerial Council meeting in Plenary Format on the 17 July 2007  noted the Irish Government's intention to make available a contribution of €580 million to help fund major roads programmes providing dual carriageway standard on routes within Northern Ireland including the route serving the North West Gateway. This is a very significant development for the North West and will help enhance the region's vital transport infrastructure.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	439	In March 2008, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012. Administrative burdens include the cost of e.g. form filling, returns, applications, retaining records etc as required on foot of regulations.This target was set in response to the invitation to Member States by the European Council to set national targets in line with the European Commission's 25% target reduction in the burden of EU regulations.My Department is responsible for devising the methodology to be used across Government, for coordinating the work across Government Departments and Agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.Initially, all Government Departments will be required to list the Information Obligations which their regulations impose on business. From that listing, Departments will assess which requirements are the most burdensome and will then measure the actual cost to business of the most burdensome requirements. At that point the most appropriate approach to achieving the overall 25% target will be re-examined, including the appropriate target for individual Departments and Agencies.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Department of Social and Family Affairs maintains the Live Register.  The total number of people recorded on the Live Register for April 2008 is 195,598.  The number of people signing on the live register in Portlaoise in April 2007 was 935 while the number signing on had increased to 1,593 in April 2008, a year-on-year increase of 70.4%.  The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the Central Statistics Office.  The most recent Quarterly National Household Survey, Quarter 4, 2007 (September-November) indicates that employment has increased by 66,800 in the year.  The unemployment rate is currently at 4.5%.The increase in the live register figures, while unwelcome, must be seen in the context of the major increase in employment over the last number of years, with the anticipated period of adjustment now being experienced.  The predictions for the medium term are for continued employment growth, albeit at a slower pace than that experienced to date.FÁS, as the national training and employment authority, has the remit to provide a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes, to assist individuals remain in and return to the labour market.  The Agency also promotes workforce development by upgrading the competencies and qualifications of individuals and by providing and facilitating targeted training programmes and services to both employers and employees.  FÁS provides its services in Co. Laois through the FÁS Employment Services Office in Portlaoise and Clinics in Portarlington, Mountmellick and Rathdowney.  The estimated FÁS expenditure on services in Co. Laois during 2008 is €9.05m.FÁS has a fast track redundancy notification system in place with my Department, to ensure a speedy and appropriate response is provided to redundant workers.  Each response is tailored on a case-by-case basis.  Since January 2008, FÁS has been advised of two collective redundancies in Co. Laois — one in the construction sector and the other in the services sector.On receipt of official notification, FÁS made contact with the HR Manager of both companies and offered the full range of services including; intensive interviews, individually and/or in groups, with affected workers.  These interviews outlined the range of supports and services available.  Ongoing support and action is provided by FÁS to keep redundant workers in touch with the Labour Market. Preparation of a ‘Skills Analysis Report' based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities.  Referral of redundant workers to jobs, upskilling/retraining courses/training courses or where necessary FÁS established special or customised courses.  FÁS also liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the City/County Enterprise Boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.FÁS is currently developing a strategy in response to the current slowdown in the construction sector and any anticipated future redundancies.  This strategy will contain a number of initiatives/measures such as working in close collaboration with the Construction Industry Federation and other key stakeholders to encourage redundant construction workers to seek retraining in skills that are in short supply in the economy.The Laois County Enterprise Board provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The Board supports individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Such supports include business related training courses for owner-managers and their staff, one-to-one mentoring provided by business specialists, in company training and start your own business courses.  In 2007 194 people availed of such training programmes run by the Laois CEB.  During 2008 Laois CEB will continue to support enterprise development throughout the county and will continue to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximize entrepreneurial development in the region.Finally, the IDA is investing in the physical infrastructure required to attract new FDI to County Laois, this includes investing €3.2m in a quality flagship Business Park in Portlaoise which is now an integral part of the agency's international marketing programme.  The Park has a modern 17,000 sq ft advance office building, which is available for marketing to inward investors.  The necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband. IDA has received planning permission for 2 x 25,000 sq ft advance technology buildings.  In addition, the OPW on behalf of the Department of Agriculture & Food approached IDA Ireland to provide 9 acres of land for the development of the Departments new National Headquarters on the IDA flagship Park in Portlaoise.  These developments will help to absorb some of the excess capacity that is emerging from the new house building sector.While the slowdown in new house building has resulted in an increase in unemployment, overall employment is forecast to continue to grow, albeit at a reduced rate than heretofore, thereby providing new job opportunities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 281 together.Under the Programme for Government, A Blueprint for Ireland's Future 2007-2012, my Department is committed to putting in place a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities which will help people into work in all sectors.  This strategy is a key component of the sectoral plan for my Department, which was published in 2006 pursuant to the Disability Act 2005.  The most significant elements of this plan are as follows:The enhancement of the effectiveness of employment programmes and vocational training for people with disabilities;Further developing supports to the open market employment of people with disabilities; andIncreasing the participation rates of people with disabilities on Community Employment over the period of the plan. Significant progress has been made in implementing the sectoral plan to date.FÁS offers a number of schemes and programmes aimed at assisting people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Supported Employment Programme, the Job Interviewer Interpreter Grant Scheme, the Workplace Equipment and Adaptation Grant Scheme, and the Personal Reader Grant.  Reviews of the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme are currently being carried out.  The findings of these reviews, which are expected to be finalised shortly, will inform future actions that might enhance these programmes.With regard to the commitment in the Programme for Government to ensure that people with disabilities have full access to accessible vocational training, this is currently being progressed as part of the policy of mainstreaming labour market services provided by FÁS for people with disabilities in line with best practice internationally.  In this context, people with disabilities who are interested in exploring training options to prepare them for open employment are encouraged to register with their local FÁS Employment Services Office and meet with an Employment Services Officer who will provide them with information and occupational guidance on alternatives in their area.  The Employment Services Office is the access point or gateway for all FÁS training courses and employment programmes.All FÁS Training Centres are accessible to people with disabilities.  In addition, FÁS will endeavour to put in place any additional support or assistive technology that a trainee with a disability might require to assist him/her to complete their training successfully once prior notice has been given at registration.  While FÁS encourages people with disabilities to consider mainstream training options wherever possible, specialist training programmes are also available for people with disabilities should they require a greater level of support than might be available in a mainstream setting.  These programmes have similar FETAC certification as mainstream training programmes.The participation limits for persons eligible for Community Employment based on a Social Welfare disability-linked payment have been increased by 1 year.  The participation limit for people with disabilities under 55 years of age is now 4 years while the limit for people with disabilities over 55 years is now 7 years.  These measures were introduced in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Wage Subsidy Scheme provides financial incentives to employers outside the public sector to compensate the employer for any deficit in productivity occasioned by an employee's disability.  The FÁS budget for the Wage Subsidy Scheme in 2007 was €10.5m and the actual spend was €7.6m.  Just under €7m was spent in 2006.  There are currently 522 people with disabilities in open employment being supported by the Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Considerable efforts have been made to date to increase the take-up of this programme by both employers and jobseekers with disabilities.  My Department has commissioned Goodbody Economic Consultants to carry out a review of the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the findings of this review, which is due shortly, will inform future actions that might enhance this programme.The Workplace Equipment and Adaptation Grant Scheme is available to employers and employees who require premises or equipment to be adapted or for the purchase of specialist equipment to assist employees with disabilities to carry out their employment tasks.  The budget for the Workplace Equipment and Adaptation Grant Scheme in 2007 was €234,000 of which €142,000 was actually spent.  The actual spend in 2007 represents a decrease on the €217,000 spent under the Scheme in 2006.  The issue in relation to these Schemes is not the lack of budget but rather the low take-up by both employers and people with disabilities, despite considerable awareness raising and promotional activities.These programmes represent just two of the employment supports that FÁS has developed for people with disabilities.  Others are the Job Interview Interpreter Grant Scheme; Personal Reader Grant; Employment Retention Grant Scheme and the Supported Employment Programme.  FÁS promotes these supports in line with its mainstreaming agenda and to ensure that people with disabilities can access employment opportunities on an equal footing with their peers.Any person with a disability with any queries about these supports or who is interested in exploring avenues that would help them to access employment is encouraged to register at their local FÁS office and meet an Employment Services Officer.  These officers are highly experienced in career guidance and have undertaken disability awareness training.

There are two Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) in place for the construction industry; one of which deals specifically with the issues raised by the Deputy, namely pension, assurance and sick pay.  Separately, there is also a Registered Employment Agreement in place for the electrical contracting industry covering all terms and conditions of employment in that sector, including pension and sick pay.Information in relation to these REAs is disseminated to employers and workers via a wide range of structures and organisations, all of whom have an important role to play in ensuring compliance by employers with the pay and conditions requirements in those sectors.  To begin with the Labour Court publishes notification of the registration of such agreements in the National newspapers and on its website.NERA, the National Employment Rights Authority, provides information to employers and employees on its website and through its call centre in relation to employment rights and responsibilities generally, and this would include responsibilities arising under REAs.  This would include providing detailed advice if requested.  Other bodies that play an important role in disseminating information on the terms of the REAs to employers and employees include the trade unions representing workers in the sectors, the Construction Industry Federation and IBEC.There are specific mechanisms in place in the construction and electrical sectors to monitor compliance and disseminate information in relation to the relevant REAs.  In the construction sector, the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency's (CIMA) role is to ensure that employers in the construction industry register their employees in the Construction Workers Pension Scheme, and pay the weekly contributions on their behalf.  For the electrical sector, EPACE advises electrical contractors of their responsibilities under, and ensures compliance with, the REA.Having regard to the foregoing, I am satisfied that there are sufficient mechanisms currently in place to ensure adequate notification to interested parties of the respective entitlements and obligations of both workers and employers under the REAs in question.

The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 386 of 2006), which is enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, places obligations on employers and employees to ensure that the risk of exposure to asbestos is eliminated or reduced to a minimum and that any remaining residual risk is adequately controlled in accordance with the legislation.I understand that under the Occupational Injuries Scheme operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs benefits may be payable in respect of insured workers affected by contact with asbestos.

It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.The Programme aims to foster an integrated and planned approach to developing sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the country.  In particular, its objectives are to:assist voluntary and community organisations to develop high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation;prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities;encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport.Since 1998 the Programme has allocated over €675 million to over 6,700 projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland and has allowed the development of sports facilities across the length and breath of the country.  These facilities have dramatically increased the opportunities for all people to engage in a wide variety of sports.  The level of funding available for spending on sport in 2008 is €336 million, which will serve to further enhance and develop the sports sector.  Furthermore the National Development Plan 2007-2013 includes a commitment to provide €991 million for sport infrastructure during the period up to 2013.The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and in increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC's basic philosophy is, therefore, one of inclusion and its Statement of Strategy recognises the potential of sport to be a driver for social change dealing with issues such as exclusion and social inequality.  All sports organisations funded by the ISC, including National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs), are encouraged to target all sections of society in seeking to increase participation in sport.   The increased funding provided to the ISC from €13 million in 2000 to more than €57 million this year has enabled a number of significant interventions for the benefit of all groups, including those not traditionally involved in sport.

Access to this service is available free of charge and has proven to be very popular already with up to 17 million hits on the web site in its first month of operation.In relation to the availability of the pre-1900 Church Birth, Marriage and Death records, in 2006 an Advisory Group was established by this Department to examine the computerisation of these records and their eventual availability through an on-line web site.  Officials from this Department have been working towards the implementation of the report's recommendations.A key recommendation in this report was that priority should be given to computerisation of the Dublin City records.  In 2007, Dublin City Public Libraries, with funding and support provided by this Department, completed the computerisation of almost all transcribed (i.e. on index cards) church records (totalling approximately 730,000 records) relevant to the Dublin City area.  Consideration is being given at present to how the un-transcribed Dublin City Records (estimated to be in the order of 800,000 records) can be computerised most effectively and in the most financially advantageous way.  Discussions have also taken place between this Department and a number of local genealogical centres with a view to securing a copy of their computerised records in the context of future Departmental funding.A copy of all the computerised Dublin City records, together with those of other centres to which this Department provides funding, will be lodged with the National Archives of Ireland.  This Department intends to develop an on-line research service to provide free of charge access to this genealogical data and initial discussions with the National Archives have taken place to achieve this.The Irish Family History Foundation (IFHF), a private umbrella organisation for the majority of local genealogy centres throughout the island of Ireland, launched its own on-line genealogical research service recently, full access to which is subject to a charge.  The IFHF does not receive any direct subvention from my Department.  However, my Department have informed the IFHF that potential future funding to complete the computerisation of the outstanding Church Birth, Marriage and Death records from pre-1900 will be subject to compliance with the Advisory Group report including the placing of a copy of the computerised records in a single web site repository and that a guarantee must be given that free public access will be given to the data on this web site.

In total 781 worthwhile projects throughout the country, including a number of GAA clubs, are benefiting from grants ranging from €500 to €10,000.  A variety of sporting and recreation activities for disadvantaged young people are being supported including funding for coaching, training, purchase of equipment, hire of facilities and outings to activity centres.My colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has overall responsibility for dormant accounts spending and the funding through my Department is an element of a larger set of economic and social disadvantage funding measures.  My Department also provides significant funding for sports in disadvantaged areas through the Irish Sports Council and the Sports Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool Programmes in addition to these special measures under the dormant accounts funds.

The Initiative operates by supporting existing and new festivals and cultural events throughout the regions which can best assist in achieving Fáilte Ireland's objective of providing new and enhanced attractions for visitors both from overseas and from within Ireland.Under the Festivals & Events programme, Fáilte Ireland has introduced a tiered investment model that enables it to offer multi-annual funding to key festivals across many regions of the country.  After the acclaimed success of the re-Joyce and Beckett Festivals, in 2007 the Department supported the 50th anniversary of the Dublin Theatre Festival.  This year it is supporting the centenary of the Hugh Lane Gallery, the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Gate Theatre, the quadcentenary of the Flight of the Earls, and the Bicentenary of Thomas Moores' Melodies.In light of their value to cultural tourism I propose to continue funding appropriate and commemorative cultural initiatives in the future.  For instance, the Department is currently providing seed funding for a major visual arts festival in Dublin in 2010 under the broad aegis of IMMA.

The Review includes a range of measures and initiatives to grow tourism business from these markets and confirms that visitors from the Asia-Pacific region will be increasingly important for Irish tourism.  The Review sets out ambitious targets for both visitor numbers and revenue earnings over the period to 2013.Work on the implementation of the measures proposed in the Review is progressing.  In this regard, I am scheduled to meet the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, Nigel Dodds MP at a North South Ministerial Council meeting in Tourism Sectoral format at the end of this month in which progress on the Tourism Ireland Business Plan for 2008 will be discussed.

Recent major events supported under the initiative include the Ryder Cup Matches, Rally Ireland, the Volvo Ocean Yacht Race and the Solheim Cup.The issue of Gaelic Games and Tourism has been discussed between GAA and Fáilte Ireland.  The GAA from its most senior administrative level and throughout the regions and local areas, will be encouraged to become more aware of the tourism potential of our national games and work with the Tourism agencies on issues of information and access.  Fáilte Ireland, in association with the Heritage Council, has also been engaged in discussions with the GAA in connection with the future development of the GAA museum.

Two new programmes of accelerated training for chefs have recently been introduced.To support the quality of the customer experience when engaging with front-line staff, a new programme in customer care has been designed and piloted across 30 tourism enterprises in the west of Ireland, and will be rolled-out nationally in 2008.Agreement has been reached between Fáilte Ireland and the Irish Tour Operators Association (ITOA) in relation to the design and introduction of a new tour guide programme which will support the recruitment of multilingual tour guides to work in the coach tourism sector.The Strategy made sixteen specific recommendations which were to be actioned by Fáilte Ireland in the period to 2010.  To date thirteen of these have been fully implemented and a fourteenth is currently underway and will be concluded by the end of 2008.   The remaining two (which relate principally to research programmes in the labour market) will be actioned in 2009.An independent mid-term evaluation of progress against the targets set out in ‘Competing Through People' was completed at the end of 2007.  The review is being used by Fáilte Ireland to identify areas of best practice and areas where significant progress has been made in the implementation of the strategy together with areas where further progress is required.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I am informed by Fáilte Ireland that a partnership of the Town and County Homes Association (TCHA) and Irish Farm Holidays (IFH) has come together, with the encouragement of Fáilte Ireland, to develop a number of theme-based holiday packages.  Over 30 B&B owners in 14 counties have been selected and have agreed their specialist areas.  The owners participated in a series of workshops between November 2007 and March 2008.Following an evaluation of the concept, Fáilte Ireland is committed to working with the sector to encourage all operators to develop specialist packages as part of the Irish Home experience.  I understand that a national steering group will be convened in June 2008 to develop this initiative further and roll it out nationally.  This will be underpinned by a market communications and promotions campaign for 2009.  Irish Home Operators are being encouraged to become members of regional activity hubs.  To date an adventure hub has been established in Cork/Kerry, a family-friendly hub in the South East, and a rural activity hub in the Glen of Aherlow.Fáilte Ireland has, as part of its support service to the wider Irish tourism sector, developed ebusiness seminars and workshops. Emphasis is placed on motivating and convincing operators that doing business on-line is not only desirable but increasingly essential to remain viable.  The focus is on allocation management and e-distribution, so that the participants are aware of and capable of using various options for selling accommodation and specialist packages on-line.  I further understand that ebusiness programmes are currently being implemented on a regional basis to encourage operators in this sector to seek more on-line business.  A further set of ebusiness programmes will take place in Autumn of 2008.  A number of workshops designed to encourage operators to provide quality evening meals for tourists are taking place throughout the country at present.  These are the latest in a series of such workshops.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Maintaining and enhancing competitiveness is a major issue for Irish tourism as it is for the economy as a whole.  In addressing that issue, it is important to bear in mind that competitiveness is about more than price and costs.  It is generally agreed that Ireland cannot and, indeed, should not attempt to compete on the basis of costs with mass tourism destinations.In considering the competitiveness of any industry, a key measure is the extent to which it can maintain and increase market share. We have been fortunate in recent years to enjoy record growth in numbers of overseas visitors and associated revenue.  The Central Statistics Office figures for 2007 show that we welcomed over 8 million overseas visitors to the Republic of Ireland, with associated foreign revenue earnings of almost €5 billion.With regard to the future, I am pleased that the tourism agencies are forecasting that the Irish tourism industry will show further growth.  Tourism Ireland's Corporate Plan for 2008-10  contains ambitious and challenging targets for tourism growth for the island of Ireland over the next three years.  It aims to increase overseas visitor numbers by  between 4.2% and 5.1% per year, which, if achieved, would mean total overseas visitors to the island of Ireland of over 10.5 million in 2010.  The plan also sets tourism revenue annual growth targets of between 6.6% and 7.1%, which, if achieved, would mean that overseas tourism would generate up to €16 billion in tourism revenues for the island of Ireland in the three-year period.While the targets are ambitious, there is little doubt that global economic factors such as currency and oil prices are likely to impact on the number of outward travellers from some of our most important markets such as North America and Great Britain.  Whereas we have little influence in relation to such global economic factors, our agencies monitor market performance during the year and adjust their marketing campaigns as appropriate.The tourism agencies will continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness as a tourism destination and will assist the industry in responding to changing conditions through a variety of programmes in marketing, human resource development, quality enhancement, product development and productivity improvement.  By doing this I am confident that the ambitious targets can be met.

The original date set by the DIG for the decentralisation of the Department to Killarney was the 2nd quarter of 2007.  As there was some delay in securing a suitable site for the new offices of the Department, it was decided to send an advance group of staff to temporary offices in Fossa, Killarney, Co Kerry.To date, 70 staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in two tranches, 45 staff in September 2006 and 25 staff in July 2007.  It is expected that a further 14 staff currently in the Department's Dublin Offices will transfer to Killarney towards the end of this year.  The objective is to complete the decentralisation process early in 2009 by which time the Department will be operating from the Department's new purpose built offices in Killarney.

It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €400 cost of education allowance is payable.  This will be increased to €500 from the beginning of the academic year 2008/2009.To qualify for participation an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.  In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant Social Welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.However, people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the BTEA scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In addition, people who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process may qualify where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends that pursuance of a third level course of study is essential to the enhancement of the individuals employment prospects.Under the NEAP, people aged 18 and under 64 who are approaching certain durations on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or offer of training.  All new claimants are currently selected for referral on reaching 3 months on the Live Register.  They remain on the Live Register while engaged with FÁS under the NEAP until they take up offers of employment or training. If they do not attend for interview or with FÁS or, having engaged with FÁS, decline offers of employment or training, their cases are referred back to the social welfare local office for review to determine if they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments.The National Development Plan (NDP) provides for the Social and Economic Participation Programme involving an investment of €50m in an Activation sub-programme over the lifetime of the plan.  The objective of the sub-programme is to promote participation and social inclusion through activation measures aimed at people of working age.  The aim is to facilitate progression regardless of the circumstances that led the person to require income maintenance. This wider activation programme will build on my Department's existing experiences in cooperation with other relevant agencies such as FÁS, VECs, HSE and other local agencies.   At present there are some 40 facilitators engaged locally in the activation process across the department's eight regional areas.  An additional 30 Facilitators are being recruited to support the Activation process.My Department and FÁS operate under a memorandum of understanding which is updated periodically and is currently under review.  Senior department officials hold regular joint meetings with FÁS and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment on policy and operational matters.  There are also regular meetings between the Department and FÁS at regional and local level.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.In this case the person concerned is over 66 and has a free travel pass. As he has a married person's pass his wife may travel on the same journey with him at no cost to them. The person's wife is under 66 and is not in receipt of a qualifying payment, so she does not qualify for a free travel pass in her own right. She must be accompanied by her husband in order to avail of free travel. The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. The purpose of allowing pass holders to be accompanied while travelling is to facilitate further this mobility. The extension of the scheme to allow the pass holder's spouse to travel alone would not be in keeping with this objective.The operation of the free travel scheme will continue to be reviewed with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.

He contacted his local Social Welfare office on 1 May 2008 and is in receipt of the allowance from that date.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	469	It is a fundamental principle of the social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions. In the case of contributory pensions, this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate. The state pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system.In 1999 provision was made to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension. The pension is paid at half the maximum rate and the person must have paid a minimum of 260 contributions to qualify for it.The objective of this measure was to provide pensions for people who could not receive payments under standard qualifying conditions, while having due regard to the contributory principle underpinning entitlement to social welfare payments generally.In 2006 a number of improvements in relation to the means test for the state pension (non-contributory) were introduced. These included an increase in the amount of capital disregarded and an increase in the general means disregard from €7.60 to €20 per week. This general disregard was subsequently increased to €30 with effect from January 2007. The effect of this is that the first €30 per week of all means is not taken into account. Budget 2008 provided for an increase of €12 per week (6%) in the rate of all non-contributory pensions, bringing the weekly rate of pension to €212 per week with effect from January 2008. These measures are of considerable benefit to many thousands of non-contributory pensioners.Increases in rates and other improvements in pensions over many years have been among the major achievements of the Government. Since 2002, the level of the state pension (non-contributory) has increased by over 58% from €134 to €212. This improvement has had a marked impact on the living standards of older people enabling them to face the future with a greater sense of security and dignity. The Government is determined to maintain and improve on the progress we have made in improving pensioners' incomes. It is committed to achieving a pension of at least €300 per week by 2012.With regard to pensions generally, the Green Paper on Pensions, which was published in October 2007, includes a discussion on a range of issues affecting social welfare pensions, including the position of people receiving reduced rate payments, or no payment. The Green Paper is at present open for consultation and will remain so until the end of this month. Submissions are welcome on all aspects of the system. Submissions can be made through the Green Paper website ( www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie ), by email: pensionsgreenpaper@welfare.ie, by fax: 01-7043457 or by post. Submissions received are published on the Green Paper website.The Government is committed to developing the framework for future pensions policy by the end of 2008.

In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for occupational injuries benefit under the Social Welfare Acts. Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme. Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.

She appealed this decision.  However, the Appeals Officer was not satisfied that she was available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work on a sustained and consistent basis and accordingly upheld the Deciding Officer's decision.  An Appeals Officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts, or fresh evidence.Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

As a consequence, the rent supplement payment was reduced. If the person concerned is not satisfied with this decision of the community welfare officer, it is open to her to lodge an appeal against the decision.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The main conditions for receipt of Respite Care Grant are that the person or persons in respect of whom the application is made must require full-time care and attention and that the applicant must be providing that care. The legislation provides that a person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where they require continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or to avoid danger to themselves.The person to whom the Deputy refers submitted an application for a Respite Care Grant in respect of his mother and his brother. In relation to the applicant's brother, the Deciding Officer refused the application on the grounds that the care being given is in the nature of help around the house and farm which does not constitute the care and attention envisaged by the legislation.In relation to the applicant's mother, the application was refused on the grounds that the Deciding Officer was not satisfied that the level of care he was providing was consistent with that envisaged in the Respite Care Grant legislation. Also the Deciding Officer was not satisfied that her condition is not such that she requires the level of care envisaged by the legislation. The Deciding Officer in coming to this decision had regard to the advice of the Department's medical assessors, who reviewed all the medical evidence submitted by her General Practitioner.The above decisions were appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The Appeals Officer, who is independent in coming to a decision, examined all the evidence submitted, including that adduced at an oral hearing, and upheld the decision of the Deciding Officer. The decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive under the legislation and may only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence not already presented.The provision of full time care and attention to a person in need of such care is the fundamental qualifying condition for the scheme. Unfortunately, the person to whom the Deputy refers was deemed not to satisfy that condition and was therefore not eligible for the Respite Care Grant.  It is open to the person concerned to make an application for the 2008 Respite Care Grant, if he feels that he may qualify.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	475	My Department provides a number of employment and training incentives to encourage and facilitate people, including people with a disability, to take up available work or training options. These include the back to work and back to education allowances.The back to work allowance provides a monetary incentive for people who are long term dependant on social welfare payments, including illness or disability related payments, designed to make return to work financially attractive and viable. The scheme is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce.The back to education allowance is an educational opportunities scheme for long term unemployed, lone parents and people with disabilities in receipt of particular social welfare payments. The objective of the scheme is to enhance the employability skills of groups who are distant from the labour market.There are also certain exemptions applying to the qualifying conditions for illness benefit and invalidity pension schemes to facilitate people to undertake employment of a rehabilitative nature. In the case of disability allowance and blind pension, prescribed levels of income from employment are disregarded in the assessment of means for those schemes.The National Development Plan 2007-13 provides for a Social and Economic Participation Programme aimed at promoting participation and social inclusion through activation measures aimed at all people of working age including people on illness or disability related payments. Engagement with customers will have progression to employment as the desired outcome. The programme will build on the existing experience and income maintenance relationship with the people concerned, in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as FÁS, VEC, HSE and other local agencies.An additional 30 facilitators will be assigned during 2008 to enhance the existing network of 40 facilitators who operate locally across the department's 8 regions.The Department has also secured funding under the European Social Fund Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007 -13 to undertake an activation programme in the Border Midlands and Western (BMW) region aimed specifically a people with disabilities. A high level objective of the programme is to develop and test a comprehensive employment strategy based on individual case management of people with disabilities. The project will bring together key organisations such as FÁS, the VEC and HSE in providing support for people with disabilities to enable them access education and training programmes. It is anticipated that the project, to be located in Mullingar, will be operational by mid summer 2008.I regard these measures as positively addressing the need to engage with people with disabilities in pursuing real opportunities to progress to training and employment.

It is neutral vis-à-vis  the employment status of the child’s parents and maximizes choice for parents. Child benefit is paid monthly in advance to 582,600 families is respect of over 1,118,000 children.At present there are no plans to move child benefit to a twice monthly payment. It should be noted that CB is paid in advance and if payments were made on a twice monthly basis the recipient would receive some payments at a later date than is now the case. A move to twice monthly payments would also have significant administrative implications, including additional costs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	477	There are two main commitments in the Agreed Programme for Government, which relate to pensioner qualified adults. These are as follows:i. Complete the scheme introduced in Budget 2007 to provide a personal pension payment for pensioner spouses in receipt of the Qualified Adult Allowance. The payment will be set at the level of a full rate Non-Contributory State Pension and the income limits will be improved to enable more people to qualify for it.:ii. Extend the Age Allowance to Qualified Adults over 80 years old.In Budget 2008, the first of these commitments was prioritised and significant progress was made in this regard. The pensioner qualified adult payment increased by €27 (15.6%) per week, bringing the payment to €200 per week, or just €12 short of the level of the State Pension Non-Contributory. This measure will cost approximately €52.8 million in 2008 and ensures that we are well on the way to completing this Government commitment. Beneficiaries of this special increase include contributory pensioner qualified adults aged 80 or over.This is the first year of the Programme for Government and good progress has been made in addressing a wide range of issues set out in the programme. Any further progression of these commitments will be considered over the lifetime of the programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 and 337 together.The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the Homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.   The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.   However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension.The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. These conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying for pensions have had an adequate and sustained commitment to the social insurance system as well as to uphold the contributory principle that underpins the qualifying conditions for all social insurance payments.The operation of the homemakers scheme is subject to review in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until 31 May 2008.  Once the consultation process is completed, work on developing the framework for future policy will commence, and I expect to have the framework completed by the end of 2008.It should also be noted that people of working age who are no longer liable for PRSI contributions may opt to protect their pension entitlements by applying to become a voluntary contributor.  In order to be admitted to the voluntary contributions scheme, a person must have a minimum of 260 weeks of PRSI paid in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of the end of the tax year during which they last paid PRSI or had a PRSI credited contribution. The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme is essential in that it ensures that the requisite minimum number of paid contributions required is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.Improvements in the area of qualified adult payments are also helping to improve the pension position of women. A qualified adult increase is payable in respect of a spouse or partner who is wholly or mainly maintained by a claimant. Since 2002, pensioner couples can opt for a payment to be made to a spouse or partner by requesting that the qualified adult portion of the pension be paid direct to the spouse or partner.  Many spouse partners without their own pension entitlement have received a direct payment in this way.These arrangements were further enhanced from the 24th September 2007 when direct payment of the qualified adult allowance was made mandatory in respect of all new pension claims.  Couples may opt to receive a single payment but only where the qualified adult indicates that she/he does not wish to receive a direct payment.  The Government has committed itself to complete the process, begun in Budget 2007, to bring payments to qualified adults up to the level of the State pension (non-contributory) over a period of three years. In Budget 2008, an increase of up to €27 per week in the qualified adult rate was granted where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over. This brings the maximum rate to €200 per week which represents 94% of the target. It is my intention to complete the process of aligning the rates in question.The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to extend payment of the over 80 allowance to qualified adults, which will benefit some 4,500 people who are receiving support as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner and improvements in this regard will be considered in a Budgetary context.  Further reforms and improvements will be considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions and the framework for future pensions policy which will follow later this year.

Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and can be beneficial to the individual. The Green Paper on pensions includes an examination of the issues surrounding retirement age and the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment.In the context of the Green Paper on pensions and the Agreed Programme for Government, I will be seeking to introduce flexibilities into the social welfare pensions and social insurance systems to encourage and facilitate longer working. However, changes to social welfare pensions represent only one aspect of the responses which will be needed in this area. In order for changes in the pensions area to have an impact we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees. At the workplace level employers must seek to retain older employees and create the working conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers.These issues, together with the questions of allowing employees choices in relation to the age at which they retire, and issues of age discrimination in the workplace, are matters for my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	480	An earnings disregard of €100 per week was introduced in September 2006 where the non-contributory pensioner and/or spouse or partner is in employment. The disregard was intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce. In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government the disregard was increased to €200 per week with effect from January 2007. Any further improvements will have to be considered in a Budgetary context, having regard to available resources and other measures for pensioners.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The development of a National Carers' Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" and the Programme for Government. A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, has begun work on developing the strategy. My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive. To date the working group has held three meetings, in February March and April.Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen's Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority. A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March. The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008. There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are currently being examined."Towards 2016" commits the DSFA to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies. Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008. Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and bodies attended. The theme was the National Carers' Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy. It is intended that a further meeting with carer groups will be held in early summer.The commitment to the development of a National Carers' Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners. An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February. The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008. Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care. It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist. Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income. This new payment is currently being developed in my Department, taking into account the various issues raised in the consultation process which has and continues to take place. Any proposed new payment scheme can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other relevant Departments and Agencies. This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of childcare, education, training and activation measures.The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny. These studies focused on identifying and resolving any practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced. These studies took place between November 2007 and February 2008. The studies allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and Agencies to be considered and facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme and accompanying supports.The outcome of the process is currently being considered in the Department. This will inform the further development of the proposals which I hope to bring to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the coming months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The Programme for Government commits to implementing significant improvements in both the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the School Meals schemes. There have been significant improvements to both schemes in recent years.The rates of back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) have been increased significantly. Since 2005, the allowance has increased from €80 to €200 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and from €150 to €305 for those aged from 12 to 22 years. These are increases of 150% and 103%, respectively. In 2006, the income limits for BSCFA were increased by €50 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate. The numbers of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 161,000 in 2006 to over 180,000 in 2007.These improvements provide a major boost to families in meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance. The improvements in BSCFA are also very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends. According to the Consumer Price Index for April 2008, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by almost 3% over the past twelve months.Further improvements in the scheme will be considered in the context of next December's Budget in light of the resources available to me for improvements in Social Welfare generally.The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes, the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme and the school meals local projects programme.The implementation of improvements in the school meals programme is well underway. Expenditure on the programme increased from €13.6m in 2006 to €27.16m in 2007, and is expected to be in the region of €32m in 2008. A large number of disadvantaged school children have been included in the programme in recent years. In 2006, some 1,394 schools with over 145,000 pupils benefited, and this increased to over 185,000 pupils in over 1,900 schools in 2007.The Department of Education and Science have identified a total of 875 disadvantaged schools under its ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS) action plan. These DEIS schools have been targeted for inclusion in the school meals local projects scheme and, to date, pupils from over 700 DEIS schools have benefited from the scheme. More DEIS schools will be included in the school meals local projects scheme during 2008.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The commitment in the programme for Government to which the Deputy refers is being advanced in the context of housing policy.  Housing supports in general are provided by local authorities but the Department provides income maintenance support where required in particular circumstances.Mortgage interest supplement provides income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists.  At the end of April 2008 over 62,025 people were in receipt of a supplement.  The scheme has also witnessed an increase in the duration of entitlement with almost 32,000 recipients now getting a supplement for 18 months or more.  The scheme was not designed to meet long-term ongoing housing needs.One of the measures introduced to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which among other things gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.  Under RAS, housing needs are met through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector, and in particular, a new public/private partnership arrangement to provide rental housing for households with long-term housing needs.  Almost 13,000 tenants have been transferred from rent supplement scheme to RAS since 2005.Significant changes to the means test for rent supplement were implemented in 2007 specifically to facilitate people returning to work and those accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS.  These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.I am anxious that all avenues are explored as regards ways of providing support for those on long-term rent supplementation including options to support them in securing home ownership.  This is being considered in the context of overall housing policy, which comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That Department already provides a range of housing supports through local government initiatives, including traditional social housing and RAS, both of which provide tenants with the benefit of Differential Rent.  They also include shared ownership and affordable housing schemes.  Any further initiatives in relation to mortgage support will be framed by that Department in the context of its "Delivering Homes — Sustaining Communities" housing policy statement and "Increasing Affordable Housing Supply" published in 2007.  A public consultation on enhancement of the existing affordable housing mechanisms is now under way.  I consider that it would be preferable to deploy resources directly in the housing support system rather than through the social welfare system.Overall, I consider that the current range of housing supports, together with the enhancements that may emerge from the current public consultation in relation to affordable housing, provide the potential to meet long-term housing needs in an appropriate and sustainable manner.

Officials of the Department have been examining the proposal and, in this regard, have engaged in discussions with EU Commission officials.  However, at this stage, it has not been possible to progress the matter as, under EU legislation discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited.More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.

This includes promoting greater awareness about household budgeting and shaping the strategies especially those of services providers, such as the banks and the credit unions, to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland.  The MABS continues to work closely with the Financial Regulator in developing initiatives in this regard.  For example the MABS and the Financial Regulator have developed an education programme on money management for Transition Year students which will be rolled out to 120 schools from September 2008.My Department is currently considering how best to progress the commitment in the Programme for Government.

Child Benefit and Maternity Benefit are the most direct financial provisions within the remit of my Department in this regard.Child Benefit, a universal payment, is paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years — and it continues to be paid in respect of children up to the age of 19 years who are either in full-time education or who have a physical or mental disability.Maternity Benefit is an income maintenance payment awarded by this Department to eligible women for a 26-week period on foot of a confinement.  Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory Maternity Leave — which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Maternity Leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional 16-week period of Maternity Leave that does not attract a benefit payment.The Government has demonstrated its commitment to supporting parenthood through the significant enhancements made to the child benefit scheme in recent years — with increases of 266% for the monthly higher rate and of 300% for the monthly lower rate since 2001.  This compares with consumer price index growth of 43.4% over the same period.In addition, the introduction of a €1,000 per annum Early Child care Supplement in 2006 in respect of all children up to the age of 6 years has increased the overall level of child income support to all qualifying families — and proportionately more in the case of low-income families.  This supplement was increased to €1,100 in Budget 2008.Likewise, Maternity Benefit rates have increased substantially from some €219 in 2001 to €280 currently.  Furthermore, the duration for Maternity Benefit has been extended from 18 to 26 weeks in recent years.  The period of weeks that must be taken before the baby is due has been reduced from 4 to 2 weeks and the final 4 weeks can be postponed in the event of the child being hospitalised.It should be noted that the Programme for Government contains the following commitment in relation to ‘Giving Parents More Time with Their Children':  Over the next five years we will:Increase paid maternity leave by five weeks and make all leave after the first 26 weeks available to either parent.Work with the social partners to promote the greater availability of family-friendly work practices.Examine the possibility of introducing paternity benefit.Examine the possibility of shared parental leave.Progression of this commitment is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the first instance.

One of these recommendations refers to Waterways Ireland, viz:Waterways Ireland should, in consultation with the Maritime Safety Directorate, establish a buoyage system for inland waterways, which is internationally recognised by all users of the waterways both national and foreign.I am informed by Waterways Ireland that there are two separate systems in use on the inland navigation system within its remit.  The one in this jurisdiction is that used on the Shannon Navigation and is referred to in the Report.  The system used on Lough Erne is entirely different to that on the Shannon and is also different to that recommended in the Report.I am advised that changing from the existing system on the waterways under Waterways Ireland's remit would be a considerable financial and logistical burden.  On the Shannon alone over 500 aids to navigation would have to be altered.  It would also require the agreement of the authorities in Northern Ireland, where no issues have been raised in relation to the suitability of the system presently in use on the Erne.  I understand that Waterways Ireland has stated that it will be happy to meet the Maritime Safety Directorate to initiate discussion on a review of the Shannon Navigation buoyage system.I have asked that these discussions be pursued as a priority and that an implementation plan be prepared to give effect to any agreed changes as quickly as possible thereafter.

Kerry.  The project involves the construction of a pier, breakwater, access road and dredging of the entrance channel.  In order to progress the project Kerry County Council need to secure the acquisition of certain portions of land at Cromane.  They were however, unable to secure the necessary compulsory purchase order in 2007 and the project failed to progress in that year.€750,000 has been allocated by my Department to this project in 2008 and Kerry County Council are hopeful of securing the necessary compulsory purchase order this year which will enable works to proceed.Greencastle harbour is under the control of Donegal County Council and has a very significant congestion / safety problem.  The recommended development option for Greencastle consists of four phases, which will provide a rock breakwater, fuel berth and mussel berth, new deep-water berths and additional berths to the inner harbour, estimated to cost in excess of €35 million (phase 1 which involves the construction of a breakwater is estimated to cost €16.8 million).This project is being co-financed by the Department of Agriculture Fisheries & Food, the Department of Community Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs, and Donegal County Council.  The development at Greencastle commenced in 2007 and funding of €1,158 million was provided in that year.€3.6 million has been allocated by my Department to this project in 2008 under the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.

These co-operatives are also working on taking a consumer brand, called Cashelmara, to the food service and retail market.  The Cashelmara brand builds on the unique provenance of Irish seafood with specific branded products from Malin Head, Greencastle, Galway, West Cork and Clogherhead.BIM have and continue to be involved in the process of developing quality schemes for products and encouraging the co-operation among industry partners.  The BIM stand at the Brussels seafood show in April provided the opportunity for these co-operatives to meet buyers from all key international markets.  The reaction from these buyers was, from initial feedback, extremely encouraging.

This scheme will to deliver on the commitments for fleet restructuring contained in the Programme for Government with €42 million committed to fund this scheme in 2008 and 2009.The scheme is a voluntary scheme which will permanently remove fishing vessels from Ireland's fishing fleet particularly the older and larger vessels.  The removal of these vessels will increase the quotas available to the more modern competitive fishing vessels and to smaller vessels and will ensure a more sustainable and profitable fleet.Further decommissioning will be considered as necessary over the period of the National Development Programme 2007-2013.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	496	BIM continues to be involved in many local and international collaborative projects that cover issues related to the marine and coastal environment, responsible fishing and aquaculture, and the sustainability of seafood supplies.Of prime importance is BIM's Position Statement on Responsible Fishing and Aquaculture, which is a blueprint of BIM's themes of responsibility, and sets out a direction for ensuring responsible and sustainable development of stocks from fisheries and aquaculture.With specific reference to Environmental Management Systems (EMS) in the catching sector, BIM is currently undertaking a pilot project entitled Seafood EMS — Green Chooser, which is helping four co-operatives to assess and improve their environmental and business performance.  Similar projects undertaken in Australia have won several environmental awards and the EMS project is run with assistance from Seafood Services Australia.  Foyle, Clogherhead, Malin Head and Union Hall co-operatives are involved in the scheme, which aims to improve quality of the product, of services, and of business relationships; to introduce provenance to buyers and create an advantage in the marketplace; and to ensure responsible practices are put in place.  These include waste management, energy management, fuel efficiency, responsible fishing, use of environmentally friendly fishing gear, and development of corporate social responsibility, all of which can ultimately be incorporated into a Seafood EMS.  This is an ongoing process that allows companies to constantly review and manage risks related to the environment, fish quality, profitability and public perception.80 per cent of Ireland's fishing fleet works in the inshore fishery, catching crustaceans such as crab, lobster and shrimp, and molluscs including scallop, whelk, clams and cockles.  Sustainable management of this resource is thus vital, both from a fisheries and a community perspective.  BIM in consultation with the Marine Institute and industry has prepared a Management Framework for Shellfisheries, which sets out a structure to deliver a sustainable and viable shellfish industry.  It is based on the preparation of long-term management plans for individual species, with achievable biological, economic and social targets and goals.Several important measures are already under way that have had a major impact.  Most recently a discussion document was launched on 28th April entitled "Managing access to the lobster fishery".  This document is designed to be the basis for discussion and agreement with industry on a long-term viable and sustainable management plan(s) for the Lobster Fishery.Management of waste fishing gear is a vital part of caring for the environment and until recently landfill sites presented the only option for fishermen to dispose of old netting.  To address these problems, BIM has looked at ways to recycle monofilament netting and undertaken a thorough analysis of the practicalities, logistics and costs of providing a waste management system for industry.

The Strategy builds on the vision and strategy outlined in the 2006 National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) published by the Government.  Sea Change aims to drive the development of the marine sector as a dynamic element of Ireland's knowledge economy; bringing about a transformation of the sector from a traditional one which is primarily associated with food harvesting to one which is multifaceted and embraces a range of new, high value, knowledge intensive, commercial opportunities developed in a sustainablemanner.The overall aim of the Sea Change Strategy is to contribute to the knowledge economy, to the achievement of key national strategic objectives (Competitiveness and Growth, Innovation, Regional and North-South Development, Environmental Sustainability) and to enhance Ireland's profile as an international leader in marine research and innovation.  The strategy provides a clear and realistic picture of future opportunities and challenges and a roadmap for selective and managed investment in marine research and innovation In 2007 A commitment of €43.8m in research funding over a 1-7 year timeframe was made as follows:NDP 2007-2013 Marine Research Sub-Programme (€10.4m)Beaufort Marine Research Awards (€20m)SSTI Award (€7.4m)ERDF Infrastructure Funding (€6m)Additionally, €21.6m was successfully secured via other national and international funding sources, for programmes/projects spanning over a 1-7 year period.  This included an investment of €2.66m from the DAFF Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) as a matching contribution for a joint Marine Institute SSTI/FIRM Marine Functional Foods Research Initiative (MFFRI).  This total investment of €65.5m from multiple competitive research funding sources will result in the creation of new capacity and knowledge generation — with some 80 new research positions and 76 PhD scholarships being created.  Overall, in 2007, 60 research groups across 23 research institutions and 21 industry performers have received funding to carry out marine-related research and innovation projects/initiatives.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	500	A National Marine Biodiscovery Programme was initiated by the Marine Institute in 2007.  This was managed by the Marine Institute, in partnership with a range of national and international centres of expertise.  This programme is driven by the strategic objectives of Sea Change, the National Marine Research and Innovation Strategy for the period 2007-2013.  The underlying objective of the National Marine Biodiscovery Programme is to assess the biological diversity of the flora and fauna of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone with a view to developing natural products as the basis for novel applications in areas such as drug discovery, functional food ingredients, and biomaterials.The principal aims of the Marine Biodiscovery Programme are to:develop and enhance interdisciplinary knowledge of Ireland's marine biota;manage and benefit from marine resources, through a more comprehensive knowledge and understanding of Ireland's marine biocomplexity;benefit human health by contributing to the development of new ethical drugs and therapies;develop new, and enhance existing, industries, through high-value commercial ventures based on bioactive substances, biomaterials and biochemical mechanisms; andmake Ireland a leader and respected international partner in niche areas of research, training development and commercialisation of high-value marine bioproducts.Following an international benchmarking exercise undertaken in 2006 the Marine Institute supported a limited  Proof-of-Concept project to establish methodologies and partnerships.  The allocation, in 2007, of research funds through the Beaufort Marine Research Awards has significantly enhanced activities in this programme.  €7.3m was awarded to three Higher Education Institutions (NUIG, UCC and QUB), supporting seven new research positions, 12 PhD scholarships and 38 student placements.  This investment will develop core interdisciplinary research teams with capabilities to isolate and identify novel chemical compounds or proteins from marine organisms for use by the biopharma sector and the medical device industry.The Marine Institute has established an initial capability, funded via the Government's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI), to aid with the collection of samples for the Biodiscovery Programme via surveys taking place onboard the national research vessel fleet (RV Celtic Voyager and RV Celtic Explorer).  In addition, the Marine Institute are in the process of establishing a Biodiscovery Lab in it's Oranmore laboratory facilities, for the preparation and initial processing of marine samples prior to dissemination to research groups. Two further initiatives have helped to increase capacity in this area:Through the HEA's 2006 Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), two new Professorships have been established in marine biodiversity (NUIG) and marine microbial diversity (UCC); andDuring 2007, the Marine Institute funded three PhD scholarships, located in DCU and UCD, through IRCSET's PhD Scholarship Programme in the areas of biodiscovery.In addition to this investment in the Marine Biodiscovery programme, €5.3m was committed in 2007 to a Marine Functional Foods Research Initiative.  This initiative is a major flagship project linked to the implementation of the SSTI, Sea Change and the Seafood Development Strategy ‘Steering a New Course'.  It aims to develop new research capabilities and additional research capacity in marine functional foods research, focusing research efforts to identify marine origin food ingredients for use by Ireland's expanding food ingredients and marine foods industries, thus supporting the future needs of these sectors.

This voluntary scheme will remove older and larger fishing vessels with mixed catches of fish such as cod, haddock, monkfish mackerel and herring.  The removal of these vessels will increase the quotas available to the more modern competitive fishing vessels and to smaller vessels and will ensure a more sustainable and profitable fleet.  The scheme is open to vessels owners in respect of fishing vessels 10 years or more in age and 18 metres or more in overall length. Vessels must be operational at the time of decommissioning and have a recent track record of fishing.  Funding to the value of €42 million has been committed to fund this scheme in 2008 and 2009.  A total of 69 applications have been received for the scheme, which closed on the 30 April.  Applications will now be assessed and prioritised in line with the requirements of the scheme and available funding.  Further decommissioning will be considered as necessary over the period of the National Development Programme 2007-2013.

The Government approved strategy for development of the Irish Seafood Industry, Steering a New Course (the Cawley Report), contains a number of provisions set-out for encouraging and supporting the development of high value seafood exports.  A Seafood Strategy Implementation Group (SSIG), chaired by Dr Noel Cawley, has been established.  This group is actively supporting and driving the delivery of the recommendations in the report. BIM promotes seafood on both the Irish market and core EU markets (France, UK, Spain, Germany and Italy).  Market Development initiatives undertaken at BIM include increased investment in market intelligence and expanding trade development staff so as to exploit buoyant consumer markets in the core EU countries.  Recently a seafood industry group visited Italy with a view to assessing and further developing sales of high value seafood there.  Other markets outside EU are dealt with on a case by case cost benefit basis.  Furthermore, BIM offer a co-funded Marketing Investment Programme (MIP) with seafood companies focussing on seafood marketing activities in the EU.BIM have also recently developed a business plan — Developing Market-led innovation in the Irish Seafood Sector, which is intended to boost the valued-adding potential of seafood exports from Ireland.  It is intended that seafood innovation would be supported by the development of a State of the art Innovation Centre in a new facility in Clonakilty and the deployment of food technologists and business development staff regionally.  It is important to note that Article 40 (2) of Council Regulation (EC) 1198/2006 which refers to the development of new markets and promotional campaigns states that "The operations may not be aimed at commercial brands or make reference to specific countries or geographical areas, . . . ".  This prohibits promotional activity on "Irish Seafood" specifically.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	504	In November 2006, agreement was reached at the Fisheries Council on an EU Regulation on Electronic Recording and Reporting of fishing activity and on a means of remote sensing of fishing vessels.  The new measures oblige fishing vessels to record and submit their logbook by electronic means at least once a day to the control authorities. Following strong pressure from Ireland, including a bilateral meeting in the autumn between Minister Coughlan and Commissioner Borg, it was agreed that the implementation rules would ensure that each Coastal Member State would have full on-line access in real time to the electronic logbook and landing declaration data of all vessels operating in its waters.  This measure will substantially strengthen Ireland's controls at sea.  The Regulation also allows remote sensing to be used to detect and track fishing vessels.  The Commission Management Committee for Fisheries agreed the Regulations on Electronic Logbooks on 6 December 2007.  The electronic logbook will be mandatory for all vessels over 24 metres in length from 1 January 2010 and it will be applied to vessels over 15 m in length from 1 July 2011.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	505	A new web based electronic system for the recording of sales of fish in Ireland has been developed.  It is now a requirement that all, auction centres and buyers of first sale fish be registered under the terms of this regime, and submit sales notes electronically within 48 hours of the first sale of fish.  Sales notes detail the size, weight, price and date of first sale fish, as well as information about the seller and vessel of origin.  In keeping with the Governments policy of developing Ireland's knowledge economy, this web based system was designed and commissioned to accommodate the registration and the subsequent submission of sales notes via the web portal www.fishingnet.ie.  Buyers now have to register via www.fishingnet.ie and have to complete sales notes using a secure username and password on www.fishingnet.ie.  This system compliments the requirement on masters of fishing vessels to complete standard log books and landing declarations.  The log-book records what type of species of fish was caught, which area there were caught in, when they were caught, the quantity caught, and the method used to catch them.  Cross-referencing sales notes with landings data i.e. logbooks (as mentioned above), improves the monitoring and control of fish landings into Ireland, and the traceability of that fish.

The applications in question are at a very advanced stage of processing.  It is important that I place the timeframe for aquaculture licensing in context.  The licensing procedure is lengthy and complex, involving a range of intermediate measures before a recommendation and decision can be made in any one case.  I should also point out that the process has become considerably more complex since the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 was enacted, due to increased activity and demands in the coastal zone and the consequent need to take an ever greater account of the:the potential impacts on safety and navigation,the ecological impacts on wild fisheries, natural habitats, flora and fauna,the suitability of the waters,the other beneficial uses of the place or waters,the likely effects on the economy of the area, andthe statutory status under European legal frameworks of the area under application.I expect my Department to be in a position to make a determination on the applications referred to by the Deputy in the very near future.

New entrants under 35 years of age received preferential access to milk quota from a specially created priority pool under the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme until 2007, and the same priority pool arrangement continued into the Milk Quota Trading Scheme.  It facilitates the acquisition by new entrants of up to 350,000 litres of quota (500,000 litres if farming in partnership with a parent) before they must pay the exchange, or market, price.  Indeed, the quantities of quota available to new entrants in their own right, and to new entrants farming in partnership with parents, have been considerably increased as a result of the introduction of the Trading Scheme in 2007.  The Trading Scheme in respect of quota allocations for the 2008/2009 milk quota year was completed in March, and the Scheme is currently undergoing a review in consultation with the farming organisations and ICOS.  Among other issues, the review is considering whether new entrants over 35 years of age should be allowed access to milk quota under the Scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	508	An application under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 3 May 2007.  The position is that no Single Payment is due as the person named had not established any Single Payment entitlements as he did not benefit from any Livestock and/ or arable Premia payments during the 2000 to 2002 reference period.With regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, processing of the application revealed that another applicant also claimed two of the land parcels declared by the person named.  In response to correspondence from my Department in relation to this issue, the person named confirmed that he did not have the right to claim these parcels. Consequently, the regulatory Scheme penalties were applied; as the total over-claim exceeded 50%, no Disadvantaged Area payment was due for the year of application and an administrative fine, equivalent to the amount of aid payable on the difference between the area declared and area found, will be deducted from any payments under Direct Aid Schemes due to the person named in the subsequent three years.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 379 together.The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme in 2005 has dramatically reduced the paperwork for farmers in applying for Direct Payments when compared to the previous system of submitting multiple applications under the Livestock Premia and Arable Aid Schemes.  In addition, the Department is currently introducing an on-line application system for the Single Payment and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme PS and the DAS scheme for 2007 to facilitate and streamline the application process, which supports Schemes worth in excess of €1.6 billion per annum to farmers in Ireland.  Over 7,500 farmers availed of this facility in its first year of operation in 2007.  I am confident that in excess of 20,000 farmers will utilise the facility, which is regarded by all users as very efficient and effective, to apply for these Schemes in 2008.  By mid April this year over 8,000 farmers had applied on-line.  It is expected that the number of electronic applications will double in 2008.Following a Commission review in 2007 on the operation of cross compliance, some legislative changes have been made which set rules for the non imposition of sanctions for minor breaches of the cross compliance requirements in addition to the possibility for a de minimus provision where sanctions up to €100 may be waived.  The review also introduced resulted in the replacement of the existing 10-month rule and a one-day availability rule for land and clarified the cross compliance responsibilities in the context of the one-day land availability requirements.  My Department has also carried out a full review of the inspection arrangements and checklists for the Single Payment Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.The issue of further rationalisation of the cross-compliance arrangements will be further pursued in the context of the CAP Health Check discussions.  My Department is also working closely with the European Commission in relation to its stated objective of simplifying the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  A number of submissions have been made to the Commission.  I intend to continue the work with the Commissioner with a view to simplifying the CAP with particular reference to the Single Payment Scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	510	A high level interdepartmental group has been established and has met twice to discuss issues of a cross departmental nature such as CAP/WTO, energy costs, waste management, regulation and market access.  The composition of a high-level strategic market access group and its terms of reference have also been agreed.  The group will comprise representatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and  Food, Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara will also be represented. In addition, a meat market access group comprising of my Department, Bord Bia and the Meat Industry  was established and has met on 6 occasions.  In this context significant progress has been made regarding access to markets such as Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the UAE and a number of emerging markets.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Bord Bia's budget was increased by a Supplementary Estimate of €1.2 million in 2007 to enable it inter alia to expand promotional activity for beef and the increased funding level was maintained in this year's Estimates.  2007 was the third year of Bord Bia's pan European Autumn Beef Promotion which involved promotion of beef in 13 export markets, covering the UK and Continental Europe.  Thirty-eight European retailers participated throughout 10,000 supermarket stores with a potential reach of over 100 million consumers.  The success of the promotional strategy can be measured by the fact that 97% of Irish beef exports are now destined for the higher-value EU market, compared to 50% as recently as 2000.  The Government's Asia strategy includes a target to double food and drink exports over the years 2005-2009 to €400 million.  Irish food and drink exports to Asia increased by 50% in 2007, with strong progress made on dairy ingredients and alcoholic beverages contributing to the target being achieved two years ahead of schedule.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Farm Improvement Scheme, introduced in July 2007 following receipt of EU approval for the 2007-2013 RDP, provided grant-aid for the areas mentioned.  Under the Scheme, grant-aid is available up to a maximum eligible investment ceiling of €120,000 with a separate ceiling of €120,000 being applicable in the case of dairy hygiene measures.  The standard grant-rate for animal housing and related storage facilities and for dairy hygiene investments is 40%.  All farmers are eligible to participate in the Scheme due to the removal of all income unit requirements from the Scheme.  New eligible items included in the Scheme are (a) rubber mats on slats, (b) installation of water retention equipment on farms, (c) mobile sheep handling facilities, and (d) out-wintering pads. Funding of €79 million was agreed for the Scheme under Towards 2016, as part of an overall programme of investment of €350m for farm waste and other on-farm investment measures.  The terms and conditions of the Scheme specifically provide for its termination when this financial ceiling was reached.  The Scheme was suspended on 31 October 2007 when 12,675 applications had been received.  Applications received before that date are currently being processed up to the level of funding made available for the Scheme under Towards 2016.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Following an extensive consultation process, the 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme (RDP) was formally approved by the Commission in September 2007.  The overall package provides funding of almost €6 billion over a seven-year period for farming measures and includes schemes for early retirement, farm investment, agri-environmental supports, installation aid and the disadvantaged areas.  An amount of €2.3bn. of the overall RDP package will be funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development.  The Programme includes a 17% increase for REPS, an 8% increase in disadvantaged areas payments and improved levels of support for the early retirement and installation aid schemes.  The various RDP Schemes commenced during 2007 and by the end of the year the total DAFF related RDP expenditure was €615 million.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 369 together.Significant progress has been made on drafting the new Animal Health and Welfare Bill and I intend shortly, to initiate a process of public consultation by publishing a consultation paper and inviting submissions from interested parties and other stakeholders.The Bill will give effect to a number of important commitments, in the area of animal health and welfare, contained in the Programme for Government.  It is a comprehensive piece of legislation, which will amend and consolidate previous legislation to reflect the changed disease status of our nation's animals and update existing legislation, to ensure that the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) is properly protected and that penalties for offenders are increased significantly.  The Bill also contains provision for repealing and revoking a number of pieces of existing legislation as some of the principal Acts in this area date to 1911.  Drafting of the Bill will continue after the consultation process, having regard to the various submissions received.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	515	My Department's responsibilities extend to animal and plant health and it works closely with the Department of Health & Children and the Health Services Executive in relation to any such diseases that may have potential implications for human health, for example in relation to avian 'flu'.I am acutely conscious of the threats of various animal disease outbreaks and my Department continually reassesses such threats. On the basis of such risk assessments, I and my officials review the adequacy of our control measures aimed at mitigating the risk of the introduction of such diseases to this country.My Department within its own internal competency operates a wide range of controls, systems and processes which regulate, monitor and manage the risks posed by diseases and pests.  This encompasses veterinary, scientific, epidemiological, administrative and legal expertise, all of which contribute, as appropriate, to the process.  My Department's state of the art veterinary and agriculture laboratories at Backweston also continue to develop as centres of excellence increasing their range of diagnostic services to underpin any challenges posed to animal, plant health or food safety.In addition, my Department is able to avail of extensive external expertise, some of which comes from other State agencies, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Met Eireann, as well as organisations such as Birdwatch Ireland and academic expertise, including that provided  by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis in UCD and the Department of Zoology at NUI, Galway.Based on various increased disease outbreak threats, my Department has offered and continues to offer biosecurity to farmers in relation to diseases as foot-and-mouth, avian ‘flu' and bluetongue.  This advise is updated as appropriate and made available in leaflet form, through the national newspapers or on my Department's website.I am satisfied that my Department has available to it all the relevant expertise to ensure that the necessary biosecurity controls and precautions are exercised and taken both at points of import and at the farm gate.  Nonetheless, I am anxious to bring a greater focus to and place a greater emphasis on the need for constant vigilance in the area of biosecurity and, for that reason, I have decided to establish, as a division within my Department, "Biosecurity Ireland" with a remit to ensure the exclusion, eradication or effective management of risks posed by diseases and pests to the economy, the environment as well as to human and animal health.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Several Government Departments have responsibility for aspects of GM Policy and  these are:Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government which has responsibility for the deliberate release of GM's into the environment including for crop cultivation;Department of Health and Children which has responsibility for GM food safety and consumer protection;Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment has responsibility for developments in the biotechnology industry and R&D; andDepartment, Agriculture Fisheries and Food which has responsibility for the regulation of GM seeds, including the co-existence of GM crops to ensure compliance with GM labelling regulations and matters relating to GM feed.The Programme for Government includes a commitment "to seek to negotiate the establishment of an all-Ireland genetically modified free zone".  A process has now begun, involving the relevant Departments, to elaborate this commitment and tease out its policy implications.  As part of this process it has been clarified that the commitment relates to the growing of GM crops, and is not, for example, about banning imported GM feed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	517	My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require an indication of country of origin on sheep, pig and poultry meat.  The draft regulations were notified to the European Commission in December 2008.  While the Commission has adopted a negative opinion on the proposal, it has afforded us the opportunity to provide further information in support of the draft legislation. This will be provided in the coming weeks.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Food advertising issues are primarily the remit of the Minister for Health and Children.  At EU level, Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims came into force in July 2007. The main aim of the Regulation is to allow consumers to make informed food choices, by ensuring that they receive accurate information and are not misled.  Claims for health benefits will have to be adequately substantiated by scientific evidence.  Food business operators are responsible for ensuring that claims they make on food labelling, presentation and advertising are authorised.My Department has encouraged the food industry to provide more nutritional information as a general principle.  A number of food companies have shown an interested in labelling based on Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) and a recent IBEC survey showed that GDAs were increasingly used by multiples.  One area of concern to the FSAI is the salt content of certain foods.  My Department has also funded research into reduced sodium breads and prepared meals and food companies have made commitments to the FSAI on reducing the salt content of foods.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	519	Obesity is, I believe, an immensely important issue for the health of our society and requires a multi-faceted response as indicated in the Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity.  The recommendations relevant to my Department have been addressed by way of specific healthy food initiatives such as the enhanced promotion of school milk and a new national initiative to promote the consumption by schoolchildren of fruit and vegetables.The National Food Dude programme, which was launched in 2007 and is managed by Bord Bia, will be implemented in over 600 primary schools this year.  The programme has reached more than 100,000 children so far and the response from parents and teachers has been very positive.  Over 3 million pieces of fruit and vegetables have been distributed in the measure, which uses repeat tasting, rewards and peer models to effect attitudinal and behavioural change.  An amount of €4 million has been allocated for the programme in the Estimates for 2008.  The EU Commission is working on proposals for an EU school fruit scheme and will publish these shortly.  Ireland has been supportive in the Council of Ministers of an EU initiative in this area.  The School Milk Scheme, which was launched in 2006, promotes a positive nutritional message, underlining again the importance of forming and reinforcing healthy eating habits early on.My Department also funds research under the FIRM programme to establish food consumption databases for the information of the food sector and policy makers in this area.  The Scientific Study  on Children's Diet by IUNA, the Irish Universities Nutrition Alliance established that intakes of fruit and vegetables, milk and fresh meat by primary schoolchildren were below recommended levels.  My Department and the FSAI have also funded an IUNA Teen Study benchmarking the dietary intake of a nationally representative sample of Irish teenagers.  Findings were presented at a workshop in Dublin on 24 January.  Funding was also awarded in December 2007 under a Food for Health Initiative by my Department and the Health Research Board for further development of food consumption databases.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	520	My Department has consistently promoted food research through direct funding of public good research under the FIRM, the Food Institutional Research Measure, and encouragement of cross Departmental and agency initiatives.  In November 2007 an amount of €5.5m was awarded to a Teagasc led research consortium in the area of marine functional foods.  This followed a joint call for research proposals by my Department and the Marine Institute.  The aim of the initiative is to optimise the research capacity and capabilities in functional foods/ingredients so as to realise the scientific and economic potential of the functional foods sector.In February 2008 proposals for funding under the Food Institutional Research Measure were invited from research institutions under the following theme areas:Food Manufacturing & Processing Technologies:New uses for Food and Drink By-ProductsNew and Innovative Food Ingredients and ProductsFood Quality & SafetyFrontiers ResearchThe innovative food ingredients theme included elements specific to the dairy sector:a. Novel and/or biofunctional ingredients — their delivery and application in the meat, beverages, cheese and snack food sectors.b. Development of healthy snack products for the cereal and vegetable sector.c. Diversification of the cheese product portfolio including new and innovative applications for cheese and ingredient-type cheeseIn 2007 the Government approved grant assistance of €6.5 million provided by Enterprise Ireland to support investment of €21 million by Glanbia in a major expansion to their Innovation Centre in Kilkenny.  The investment will see 23 additional highly qualified R&D jobs at the Centre on top of the 25 already in place, making it the largest dedicated R&D centre for a dairy food company in Ireland.  This type of investment meets national objectives under my Department's Agri Vision 2015 Plan of Action, which encourages companies to move towards higher value added products.I was also pleased that Teagasc Moorepark have been awarded funding under the European Framework Programme (FP7) in relation to participation in a programme to develop innovative and practical breeding tools for improved dairy products from more robust dairy cattle.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The Farm Improvement Scheme (FIS) introduced in 2007 extended grant-aid to feeding systems and increased the specific investment ceilings for milking machines and bulk milk tanks from €16,000 to €40,000 for milking machines and to €25,000 for bulk milk tanks.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	522	My Department is actively working with relevant stakeholders to progress a herd health initiative to deal with non — regulated diseases and conditions in a comprehensive and integrated manner.  The initiative has been proposed to enable Ireland achieve international best practice in the area of animal health and is intended to complement existing animal health programmes.My officials have had discussions with the principal stakeholders, including farming organisations and representatives of industry, service providers and relevant state agencies and all have indicated their broad support for the initiative.  Following on this, formal proposals were circulated to the stakeholders inviting them to indicate if they can support the initiative and its intended objectives and seeking commitments from them to funding.  I am satisfied that there is a genuine commitment by all parties to work together on this initiative to improve animal health.  A number of those contacted have already responded positively to the formal proposals circulated and we are awaiting definitive responses from the remaining stakeholders.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The Sheep Strategy Implementation Group reported in April 2007 and addressed the various recommendations of the Sheep Industry Strategy Group.  The Implementation Group recognised that many of the recommendations fell to be implemented by the industry itself but my Department and the state agencies under my aegis are also playing an active role. Progress is being made in implementing the recommendations.  Some have already being implemented whereas work is continuing on others.  The following paragraphs set out the position regarding those recommendations specifically directed at my Department and related agencies:Under REPS 4, a new mixed grazing measure specially targeted at sheep farmers has been introduced and development of this measure is being  kept under review.  Plans for the upgrading of a Sheep Genetic Improvement Programme are well advanced and I hope that agreement can be reached and a new programme put in place for the 2008/2009 sheep breeding year.My Department has recently facilitated trials on mechanical grading for sheep and the results will be assessed in the coming months.  Farmer confidence in the pricing system operated by plants will be improved if mechanical grading can be introduced and this should result in efforts to improve quality and respond to the needs of the market.Teagasc has developed a comprehensive plan to restructure their sheep support services, including a programme for Technology Evaluation and Transfer farms, which includes hill and lowland areas.  This approach will provide an opportunity for developing a dialogue with sheep farmers about the application of the latest management practices to their enterprises and identify research and development needs.The Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme was established by Bord Bia in 2007.  Some 6,000 farms have been registered and over 4,200 farm audits have been carried out.  In 2007 the Department made available €0.4m to support inspections under the scheme and this funding was repeated in 2008.In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, promotional efforts are very necessary.  Bord Bia will continue to organise strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets.  The downward trend in lamb consumption in certain markets presents a real challenge.  To address this, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts on a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the very important French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The poultry and eggs quality assurance schemes are working well and have helped to alleviate consumer concerns as regards the sourcing and quality of product.  In excess of 80% of eggs sold at retail level are covered by the Egg Quality Assurance Scheme (QAS) which is accredited to EN45011 which is the European standard for bodies operating certification systems such as quality assurance schemes.  This QAS is being currently updated to include hygiene legislation for both packers and producers.  This year Bord Bia plans to upgrade the chicken QAS to EN45011.  The Pigmeat QAS also operates under the provisions of EN45011 which includes independent inspection and certification.  Bord Bia plan to increase the number of farmers who are participating in the pigmeat scheme.The Irish Grain Assurance Scheme (IGAS) assures customers that grain is produced, handled, stored and transported according to a defined Code of Practice.  Almost 6,000 cereals producers are now participating in the scheme, which accounts for approximately 90% of grain traded in Ireland.  My Department is supportive of the scheme and has engaged in discussions with the Cereal Association of Ireland concerning their aim of achieving EN45011 accreditation for the scheme.  Teagasc carries out assessments of merchant members of the scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The annual forestry premium increased by 15% from 2007, with a maximum payment of up to €574 per hectare per annum paid over 20 years.  Under the new FEPS an additional premium of up to €200 per hectare for five years is available to farmers in REPS who join FEPS.The target of 30% broadleaf planting has been achieved in 2005 and 2006 and this  broadleaf planting target remains in place for the 2007-2013 programming period.  The incentives for broadleaf planting continue with higher premiums payable for broadleaf species.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Following a full review and consultation with the sector, the Forest Environmental Payments Scheme (FEPS) has been amended and has been rolled out as an established scheme.   The threshold of 8 hectares has been reduced to 5 hectares for small farms (less than 30ha), attracting a €150/ha rate for plantations between 5 and 8 ha, and €200/ha thereafter.  At the other end of the scale, a standard rate of €200/ha will apply for all plantations irrespective of the size of the farm on which they are established; before this a sliding scale applied, whereby the FEPS payment reduced progressively in line with the relevant REPS payment.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The review of the main elements of the 1946 Forestry Act has now been completed and draft Heads of a Forestry Bill have been prepared.  The draft Scheme of the Forest Bill, along with the Screening Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and Memorandum for Government have been prepared and will be submitted to Government shortly for approval to send to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  Any additional amendments of existing forestry legislation will be considered subsequently.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Bord Bia as part of its function to promote marketing opportunities continually assists producers and market organisers on sales, marketing, product development, consumer aspects.  It has taken the lead in publishing a guide on ‘Alternative Routes to Market'.  This provides step-by-step plans, checklists and guidelines to assist growers and food entrepreneurs who wish to set up in business through farmers' markets, farm shops and box schemes.  The Guide was launched at the National Conference on Local Food in Mullingar organised by my Department and Bord Bia in October 2007.Over 100 farmers markets operate throughout the country and in December 2007, Bord Bia and my Department surveyed the organisers of Farmers' Markets to monitor progress and highlight any issues which need to be addressed.  The findings of the survey were presented at a Local Authority Forum on Farmers Markets in January which brought together key representatives — Mayors, Local Authority Managers, Cathaoirligh, and Town Clerks — from local authorities to discuss direct routes to market for local food and, in particular, farmers' markets.  Examples were also presented of markets operating in Ireland, UK and France.  Discussions have since taken place at inter-Departmental level and a group will shortly be established to work on draft guidelines for local authority farmers markets and to consult widely to promote a common approach to assist authorities and small local food producers.  Teagasc has also established a training programme for "Direct Selling" designed to meet the needs of traders involved in farmers markets.Bord Bia has worked with the Office of Public Works (OPW) to develop the exceptionally successful Farmleigh market model, which has been used seasonally on Fota and in the JFK arboretum, and is working with Dublin City Council on the Smithfield market project.  An all-Ireland St Patrick's Day food market was held in Covent Garden London on 15th & 16th March 2008.  Some 50 artisan producers took space in the market selling farmhouse cheeses, traditional breads, smoked fish, and luxury confectionery. Bord Bia is also promoting Farmers Markets through sponsorship of the 2008 RTE television series ‘Fresh from the Farmers Market'. This will feature 16 markets and 24 producers from around the country providing the public and producers with experiences of the real opportunities in this area.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Bord Bia continues to operate Quality Assurance Schemes for beef, lamb, pigmeat, poultry and eggs.  At present there are more than 25,000 certified farms in the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme and close to 4,000 members in the Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme.  Horticulture schemes are also in place.  Deputies will have seen the increasing display of the Bord Bia Quality Assurance logo on a range of produce.The Suckler Welfare Scheme introduced by my Department and the exceptional take-up by producers have the potential to demonstrate to international buyers even further the standards underlying Ireland's clean and green food and the commitment of all stakeholders to maintaining those standards.   Bord Bia continues to bring food companies together with targeted buyers internationally and to highlight via market/sector specific publications the strengths of Ireland the Food Island.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Regional Food Forum initiative was launched by my Department to build closer links between state agencies and food businesses and to develop regional and local foods.  The Fora showcased local food and drinks products, research was presented on emerging market opportunities, regional food business and agency directories were published and successful local food entrepreneurs generously shared their experiences.  In 2007 two Regional Food Fora were held in the West (Claregalway) and the South West Forum (Cork) regions completing the series of six.  The earlier fora were in the North-West (Killybegs), the North-East (Carrickmacross), Midlands (Port Laoise) and South-East (Kilkenny).  The positive response from small, speciality and artisan businesses attending was borne out by a qualitative survey conducted by Bord Bia. The survey was an input into the decision to hold a National Conference on Local Food.The National Conference on Local Food held in Mullingar in November 2007 was a joint initiative by my Department and Bord Bia and aimed to raise awareness of local food, provide practical information for those involved in local food production and address some of the issues highlighted at the Regional Food Fora. The audience comprised local food producers, relevant producer associations and organisations, key opinion formers and influencers, industry representative bodies and relevant state agencies. Some 250 people attended.In February 2008 an Artisan Industry Committee was established under the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan complementing the other industry, agency and research groupings and providing a structure for the sector and the Department to examine issues to promote regional and local food strengths.  The widening of the membership of the Department's Consumer Liaison Panel announced on 5 May, will maximise consumer input into the Department's activities having regard to increased attention on food production and agri-environmental matters.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Waste management is primarily a matter for the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The control authorities for water, nitrates and integrated pollution are the Environmental Protection Agency and/or local authorities.Under the cross-compliance arrangements operated by my Department for certain schemes, including the Single Payment Scheme, checks on farms are undertaken for compliance with the requirements of the nitrates regulations. The Department has also taken steps to assist farmers meet their obligation under the Regulations, such as the  publication of an Explanatory Handbook, information meetings for farmers and providing statements of nitrogen and phosphorus produced on farms.In addition, a revised Farm Waste Management Scheme was introduced by my Department in March 2006 in order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the Nitrates Directive.   Under the Scheme, grant-aid is available at a standard rate of 60% (70% in the four Zone C counties) to farmers who complete investment works under the Scheme.   48,580 applications were received from farmers under the Scheme and, to date this year, €68 million has been paid out to farmers under the Scheme, compared to €114 million in the calendar year 2007.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I am very anxious that all those farmers who have still not submitted their 2008 Single Payment application would do so immediately. I am concerned that so many applications are still outstanding from farmers who made an application in 2007. There is absolutely no scope to extend Thursday's closing date, which is the latest date for receipt of applications allowed under the governing EU rules.  I urge all farmers to complete their application form and return it immediately in the envelope provided. The form can be posted to the address on that envelope to reach my Department no later this Thursday, 15 May, or it can be handed in to any of my Department's offices around the country, including those mentioned by the Deputy, up to close of business on that day.As a further help to farmers to meet Thursday's deadline, I am arranging that all Department offices, including those mentioned by the Deputy, will remain open until 9 pm on Thursday next to accept applications.  I cannot stress enough the importance of the application being submitted on time, not only in the context of the Single Payment, but also for farmers who are applicants under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the REPS Schemes, Energy Crops Scheme and Protein Crops Scheme as these farmers are obliged to submit a Single Payment application by the 15 May deadline.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I propose to take Questions Nos. 385 and 386 together.At present, farmers can choose to have their payments made by cheque or electronic funds transfer directly into their bank account and this situation will continue during the 2008 EU financial year which ends on 15 October.  However, as and from the 2009 EU financial year commencing on 16th October 2008, payment by cheque will no longer be permitted under EU rules on the financing and management of the Common Agricultural Policy.  From that date, my Department is required to make all payments under EU funded or co-funded schemes, including the Single Payment Scheme, directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.  As the designated paying agency for EU funds, my Department is obliged to implement this new requirement.My Department has notified the new requirement to farmers on a number of occasions over the past year and did so again in the past two weeks or so.  A very large number of farmers have now ‘signed up' for electronic funds transfer.  Farmers who have not yet done so still have a number of months in which either to open a bank account or to notify my Department of the details of existing bank accounts.  I will be urging all farmers to make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible so as to avoid disruption to their payments.My officials have briefed the banks on the new requirement and have also met with Postbank which I understand is launching a new current account which will facilitate the electronic transfer of funds for farmers and which can be opened and operated through the Post Office network.  My Department will also arrange payments to accounts in any Credit Unions which has the facility to process electronic transfers.My Department will continue to issue a remittance note to each farmer in respect of all electronic payments setting out the amount and details of their payments.

The remaining 25% payment will go out when the last of the year's REPS on-farm inspections has taken place.  This means that these payments will be processed in December.The Commission agreed that payments under REPS 2 and REPS 3 could continue to be made at the beginning of each contract year, as before, but insisted that the new rules must apply from the outset to participants in REPS 4.

These files have not been formally handed over to the National Archives as they contain title documentation of all land acquired by the former Commission for distribution under the Land Purchase Acts.  My officials regularly access these files to service queries from the public relating to current and past transactions involving the former Land Commission.Certified copies of title documents are issued to vendors or purchasers their successors in title or their respective solicitors under Order XIX of Statutory Instrument No 341 of 1939.  Access to these documents is also governed by Statutory Instrument No 230 of 1964.Personal and other information contained in the files is also accessible under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts.  There are no plans at present to make the files generally available for research purposes. However, limited access may be made available following application to the Legal Services Division of my Department.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	540	A programme of reform and expansion of undergraduate medical education and training commenced in 2006 following the acceptance by the Government of the report entitled "Medical Education in Ireland A new Direction" ( the Fottrell Report) published jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.  The measures being implemented under the programme include an increase in the intake of Irish/EU medical students, changes to the entry criteria for medical courses, the introduction of a graduate entry programme and curriculum reform.The Fottrell Report recommended an increase in Irish/EU places in medicine from 305 to 725 over a four year period. The increased intake is being achieved through the provision of an additional 180 undergraduate places and the introduction of a new programme of graduate entry to medicine which will provide 240 places.  In the 2006/07 academic year, an additional 70 undergraduate places were provided amongst the existing five medical schools and an additional 40 places were provided in the 2007/08 academic year. A further 35 places will be provided in 2008/09 and again in 2009/10.The programme of graduate entry to medicine has commenced in the current academic year with 60 new places created. A further 60 graduate places will be provided in the 2008/09 academic year and the graduate stream will grow to 240 places by 2010/2011. This includes 95 places in a new medical school which has been established at the University of Limerick, bringing the total number of medical schools to six.The reforms in medical education which have been agreed with the universities and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland include a new entry mechanism to undergraduate medical education to be introduced from 2009 to replace the current selection system.  The new selection process will be open to all students who achieve a threshold level of 480 points and meet matriculation requirements. In addition it will include a medical school admissions test that complements the Leaving Certificate examination by assessing a range of general and personal skills and competencies. Weighted credit will be given for performance in the Leaving Cert up to 550 points, with significantly moderated credit for any points above 550.The new selection criteria are designed to provide students who reach the threshold of 480 points in the Leaving Certificate with a reasonable prospect of achieving the entry standard based on strong performance in the admission test. More details of the revised entry criteria will be available shortly.The Fottrell Report highlighted the need to enhance investment in medical education and training to meet the standards of training expected internationally and in response significant investment has been committed under the National Development Plan. Some €32m of extra dedicated funding has been provided since 2006 for medical education through the Higher Education Authority to support the expansion programme and to provide for the employment of academic clinicians and curriculum reform.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Over the seven years of the NDP €13 billion will be invested under the Human Capital Priority to develop the capacity of the higher education sector to meet a number of key national objectives, including that of increasing the numbers of students participating in the sector.Levels of mature student participation have seen an unprecedented growth from just 4.5% of full-time new entrants in 1998 to 12.8% in 2006-07.  In fact, over the three academic years from 2004-05 to 2006-07, there has been a 29% increase in the number of mature students taking up places in the universities and institutes of technology.  In that suite of institutions alone there are now over 4,100 mature students commencing undergraduate studies each year.In addition to the core funding of institutions, innovative new initiatives on the part of third level institutions to increase levels of access and lifelong learning are also being supported by the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF).  Over the course of the NDP it is planned that €510 million will be allocated to third level institutions through this fund.  This funding is supporting some interesting new collaborations on the part of networks of higher-education institutions focusing on the needs of learners from disadvantaged communities.A number of projects aim to significantly increase part-time and flexible learning opportunities for adults who wish to develop their levels of education and skills.  The National Access Office are currently developing a new action plan which run concurrently with the National Development Plan (from 2008-2013).  The plan will examine emerging issues and challenges, including progression from further to higher education.  It will highlight ongoing and new areas of action, including work with institutions on the development of an ‘access plan' as an integral element of the overall strategic planning process.  The National Access Office will propose new national targets for participation in higher education.   Strategies to support the achievement of those targets will be linked to the allocation of funding by the HEA.The implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a new system of means-tested free fees for approved part-time courses will be considered over the life time of the Government. In relation to the commitment on part time fees in paragraph 7.9 of Towards 2016, my Department and the HEA have initiated the process of developing proposals for a targeted fund, to be financed from the National Training Fund, to support workers pursuing part-time courses at third level in public institutions.In developing criteria for the operation of the fund regard will be given to the following  objectives:targeting people in work who have not had the opportunity to pursue third level education previously to level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework; reducing the amount of fees that workers pay; maintaining the current benefits in relation to employer support and tax relief available to workers in respect of third level fees; and allowing for a part refund to be paid on successful completion of each academic year of the relevant course.The criteria for accessing the fund will be developed in close consultation with other stakeholders. My Department will be initiating these consultations in the coming weeks.

There are no plans to extend this initiative to cover third level institutions in Northern Ireland.Under my Department's Higher Education Grant Schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU Member States, including Northern Ireland.  In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.  However the payment of undergraduate tuition fees under these schemes does not extend to approved courses outside the State and there are no plans to change this position at present.It is understood however that students attending Higher Education Institutions in Northern Ireland and who are ordinarily resident in a Member State of the European Union will be eligible for a fee loan from the Northern Ireland Authorities up to the amount charged by the Higher Education Institution. Further clarification can be sought by the individual from Department of Employment and Learning in the Northern Ireland.  The e-mail address is studentfinance@delni.gov.uk.
Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 also provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states.

A total of €1.7m has been allocated to the scheme.This scheme had been developed as part of my Department's response to the education-related recommendations contained in John Fitzgerald's report, ‘Addressing issues of Social Exclusion in Moyross and other disadvantaged areas of Limerick City: Report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion', which were accepted fully by the Government.The scheme aims to support up to 22 DEIS Band 1 schools in Limerick City to enable them to make their school premises and facilities available to children and the wider community after school hours, at the weekend and during school holidays.  The names of the schools are included in the lists following.  The intention is that the school premises would be available for a wide range of activities, including homework clubs, drama, art and craft, adult literacy and sports.Eligible schools will be able to apply for a once–off capital grant of up to €25,000 to cover the additional cost incurred to make the premises suitable for use out of school hours.  The schools can also apply for a grant of up to €26,000 per annum for a period of two years to cover additional operating costs.Preparatory works to roll out this scheme are at an advanced stage and my Department hopes to be in a position to invite the eligible schools to apply for the funding before the end of this month.Roll No.NameAddressCounty64200RColáiste MhichilSexton Street, LimerickLimerick64250JPresentation Secondary SchoolSexton Street, LimerickLimerick64280SSalesian Secondary SchoolFernbank, LimerickLimerick64290VArdscoil MhuireCorbally, LimerickLimerick71920TSt Nessan’s Community College (VEC)Moylish Park, LimerickLimerick91446GSt Endas Community SchoolKilmallock Rd, LimerickLimerickRoll NoUrbanSchool NameAddressCounty00570RUrbanMhuire Naofa CailíníMhuire Naofa, LimerickLimerick06936RUrbanSt John NS ConventCathedral Place, Limerick CityLimerick15320CUrbanSt Michaels NSCBS Grounds, Sexton Street, LimerickLimerick16715HUrbanSt John The Baptist Boys N SDowney Street, Pennywell, LimerickLimerick16910FUrbanScoil IosagáinSraid Seasnain, LimerickLimerick17445JUrbanScoil Lile NaofaKileely, LimerickLimerick17737WUrbanOur Lady Queen of Peace SchoolJanesboro, LimerickLimerick17941VUrbanSt Munchins G N SBallynanty, LimerickLimerick17942AUrbanScoil Mhainchin BuachBothar Siolbroin, LimerickLimerick19372SUrbanSouth Hill N SSouth Hill, LimerickLimerick19667OUrbanOur Lady Of Lourdes N SRosbrien, LimerickLimerick19830WUrbanCorpus Christi N SMoyross, LimerickLimerick19931FUrbanGaelscoil SheoirseClancy, An Cnoc Theas, LuimneachLimerick20018HUrbanMaria King Presentation PrimarySexton Street, LimerickLimerick20184BUrbanGalvone NSKennedy Park, Limerick CityLimerick20185DUrbanSt Marys Boys NSIsland Road, LimerickLimerick

Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department's DEIS programme, schools in, or serving, RAPID areas and special schools.The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures.  The four measures are: Outdoor Play Facilities, Libraries, Parent Rooms and Dining Areas.  Schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  Due to the volume of applications received, the assessment process has had to be carried out on a phased basis.  Under previous funding rounds, 447 outdoor play facilities and 146 library enhancement projects have been approved for a total of €11.26 million in grant aid.€20.5 million has been made available to fund the scheme under the 2006 and 2007 Dormant Accounts Programmes.  In March, 2008, the Government announced that a further €4 million of funding, consisting of €2 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund and €2 million from the RAPID Leverage Fund, would be made available to fund a further tranche of library enhancement projects that could not be included in the first tranche due to insufficient funding being available.Further library enhancement proposals have now been assessed in accordance with the criteria set out in the Dormant Accounts Board Disbursement Plan 2006-2009 and the applications rated as meriting funding have been determined.  The general criteria applied to the assessment of such proposals are:1. Evidence of need2. Evidence of capacity3. Consistency with Government policy programme and objectives4. Evidence of additionality5. Strength of proposal6. Consideration of sustainabilityIn accordance with Dormant Accounts legislation, Government approval for funding the recommended projects will be sought by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the near future.  Following approval, my Department will write to the schools concerned to advise them of the outcome of their applications.

Work on this database is underway as part of a general review of rental policy being undertaken.Information will be collated on approximately 900 schools which have received approval from the Department to rent temporary accommodation, including but not limited to prefabs.This will be used to produce a database of information which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and will inform my Department's future decision-making in this area. This work is well advanced and I anticipate it will be completed shortly.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	565	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.   There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to provide 4,000 additional primary teachers between 2007 and 2012. With the extra teachers already put in place this year and those provided for in the Budget, we are ahead of target with about 2,000 extra primary teachers to be delivered within just two years.Over the lifetime of the Government, we are committed to providing more primary school teachers specifically to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established Junior Certificate, Leaving Certificate, repeat Leaving Certificate and Transition Year Programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, Post Leaving Certificate courses and Leaving Certificate Applied. The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support. An independent Appeals Committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years. In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  For 2006/2007, the corresponding figure is 25,454 wholetime equivalent posts.This increase in staffing has dramatically improved the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The pupil teacher ratio has fallen from 13.9:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.13:1 in the 2006/2007 school year.Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options including Irish, English and Maths having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The Deputy may be aware that the Teaching Council has a statutory role in relation to the review of standards required for entry into the teaching profession, including the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching. The Council has begun its work in relation to this review and will produce a Strategy for initial teacher education. To this end, the Council held a series of consultation for a for stakeholders in education in February of this year, and the Council will continue to consult with education partners, including my Department, over the course of their work.  I look forward to receiving the Council's Strategy in due course.Regarding the reservation of places for students from disadvantaged areas, all of the Colleges of Education have a direct entry scheme for such applicants.  The intake of students via this stream of entry to initial teacher education programmes has admittedly been low, this is due to a number of factors including low numbers of applicants and the fact that some students from disadvantaged areas apply successfully for teacher education programmes via the ‘normal' route. My Department will continue to monitor the intake of students from disadvantaged areas in the Colleges of Education and will liaise with the Colleges as necessary. These programmes are reviewed and adapted on an ongoing basis to address the evolving nature of the education system and the factors affecting teachers on the ground.My Department will continue to prioritise high quality in-career professional development for teachers and principals.  There are a range of national programmes in place to support teachers' professional and personal development covering such diverse areas as curricular or syllabus change, support for teaching and learning methodologies, improving teachers' competence in the teaching of the Irish language as a communicative tool, child protection, student behavioural issues, development of leadership skills in schools, whole school planning, addressing the teaching of children with special educational needs and so on. In addition, the national network of education centres provides a range of local and summer courses for teachers, which respond to identified needs and advance the quality of teaching and learning generally.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully aware of the funding pressures on schools. The Government is committed to doubling the primary capitation grant by 2012 and to significantly increasing the value of the ancillary services grant that is used by schools for the employment of support staff such as caretakers and secretaries.These commitments are a direct follow-on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.Since 2001, the standard rate of primary capitation grant has been increased by 86%.  In the same period, the value of the ancillary services grant has been almost doubled.In 2001, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €52,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school today is receiving almost €100,000. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department. By any standards this is a very significant improvement within a relatively short period of time.In 2008, primary schools are getting €330 per pupil in such grants — €21 more per child than they got last year. At a national level, this adds up to an investment of around €167 million in standard day-to-day funding for schools.  In addition to this, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.Extra funding is also being targeted at schools serving disadvantaged communities. Indeed, funding for additional grants for the most disadvantaged schools increased by 15% this year, reflecting the Government's determination to prioritise those that need extra resources the most.I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. My Department will be considering how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level, as envisaged in the Programme for Government 2007-2012, having regard to available resources.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	570	As the Deputy is aware, on 4th January 2008, details were announced by Government of the transitional arrangements which will apply for schools water services as part of the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. This statement reiterated the Government's commitment to the implementation of the Directive, which has as its objective the promotion of water conservation and the efficient use of water as an important and scarce natural resource.The legal advice available to the Government is that under the EU Framework Directive all non-domestic users must pay for water used. Schools, like other non-domestic water services users, must pay water charges. This advice also confirms that schools will be required to pay the full cost of water services used on a metered basis with effect from 1st January 2010. The Directive also requires that measures are put in place up to 2010 to move towards full cost recovery.For the transition period the Government agreed that non-fee paying recognised schools will pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows:- 2007- €3 per pupil, 2008 — €3.50 per pupil and 2009- €4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering will be recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess payment.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements for implementing this decision.The new arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place the necessary water conservation arrangements and practices and undertake necessary works to ensure that when full water charges are introduced in two years time schools will have significantly reduced their water usage and, by virtue of good water conservation, be in a much stronger position to meet their water charges. Those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.Water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.  A circular has issued from my Department to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists.On the issue of waste allowances, progressing that particular strand of the commitment is primarily a matter for my colleague — the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My predecessor was in contact with Minister Gormley on this issue and my Department will of course input to and support as required any work being done by that Department on the commitment.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	571	As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government commits my Department to establishing a Developing Areas Unit.Initial work on establishing and assigning dedicated staff to the Unit began in the latter part of 2007 and it is now fully operational.In terms of its work programme for 2008, the Developing Areas Unit is advancing the delivery of 30 new primary schools which are planned to be in place for September 2008. These projects are being delivered in areas which have been identified as areas of rapid population growth. Minister Hanafin announced the details of the individual projects in February.To deliver its 2008 programme, the Developing Areas Unit has been working closely with relevant Local Authorities on the acquisition of sites and on general pre-planning issues.Project Managers, together with architectural, engineering and quantity surveying services were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 to prepare the planning applications, undertake the necessary surveys and oversee the delivery of the schools on each site. Sites for each of the projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.An EU tendering process to establish a drawdown contract for the off-site construction of permanent and temporary accommodation has been completed.   The successful tenderers for the construction of each individual project have been notified and at this stage, construction of a number of the schools has already commenced.  The programme for the delivery of these projects is broadly on target, however, the time-frames are very challenging and risks to the timely delivery of these new schools still exist and are being managed by the Developing Areas Unit.When taken with a number of other projects in developing areas involving extensions to existing schools, approximately 9,000 additional school places will be provided for September 2008.In the meantime, the Forward Planning Section of the Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed for 2009 and onwards. This is also being done in close consultation with local authorities. Forward Planning Section's findings will feed into the Developing Areas Unit for further action.My Department is satisfied that the approach which it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places in rapidly developing areas will, subject to the availability of funding, ensure that those places will be provided when and where they are needed.

Moreover, the draft guidelines state that:"No substantial residential development should proceed without an assessment of existing schools capacity or the provision of new school facilities in tandem with the development."In addition, the procedures to be adopted by planning authorities in integrating schools planning issues into their development planning processes are outlined in the Planning Guidelines on Development Plans.My Department has been developing in partnership with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the City and County Managers Association a code of practice for planning authorities on the provision of schools in the planning system. It is intended that these guidelines will be issued in the coming weeks.

A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Departments website to assist design teams in best practise in the design development of projects and to encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.My Department has developed Generic Repeat Designs to reduce the cost, speed up the delivery of new schools particularly in developing areas and ensure that the most up to date technologies are used. This year further design templates are being developed, using appropriate off site construction technologies, for repeatable buildings.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	574	As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to prioritise energy efficiency and eco-design in new school buildings.  Indeed my Department has a strong record in developing low energy educational buildings.  For the past eight years my Department has been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings.  This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology.The Department takes a holistic approach and has developed technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents.  These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.  There is particular emphasis on elimination of over design, improved thermal envelope design and improved passive solar design, natural ventilation and day lighting along with advanced heating and lighting controls.It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than international best practice.  The performance of my Department in this area has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and recently by the Taoiseach's Public Service Excellence Awards.The development of energy efficiency and eco-design will continue to be kept under review to take account of improvements in technology in the market place.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	575	As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government commits my Department to promote and support the use of school facilities by community groups and other appropriate services and design new schools in order to facilitate multi-use.The primary responsibility of my Department in this area is the provision of school facilities for the effective delivery of the curriculum.  In addition, school authorities have a considerable degree of autonomy in relation to how their premises are managed and utilised at local level.However, the Government recognises that there is a lack of recreational facilities for community use in certain areas which could be met if school premises were made available to the wider community.  To encourage schools in this respect, my Department issued a circular to all school authorities in late 2005 urging trustees and Boards of Management to make their facilities available where possible for community education and recreation purposes.Decisions in relation to the use of school facilities remain entirely at the discretion of the school authorities, subject to the condition that the needs of the students attending the school are prioritised in the first instance.My Department has also progressed a number of school building projects within the Fingal and Adamstown areas of Dublin with local Authority/Developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing.  I believe this model can be used to advantage across the country in future particularly in the area of shared community facilities.  In respect of PPP schools, the contract arrangements provide for school facilities to be available for community use when not required by the school.My Department's position generally is that the availability of such facilities should be self-funding i.e. adequate to cover the heat/light/caretaking arrangements as well as making some contribution to the repair of wear and tear on premises caused by increased use.  It is of utmost importance that schools should ensure that insurance and security are covered as it is unlikely that the school's insurance policy would cover non-school activities or that a caretaker would be routinely available to open/lock up premises.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	577	In November 2006 the funding for the minor works grant was increased by 44% on the previous year.  Around €27m was paid out that year and a similar amount for the 2007/8 school year to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.  Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil.It is intended that the Minor Works Grant for the 2008/2009 school year will be paid in the early part of 2009.  The level of grant to be paid under the grant scheme will be considered in that context and in the light of the trend in the cost of building works generally.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	578	As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to ensure that where the State builds a new school on land which it owns, the building will be in the ownership of the Department of Education.Those sites that are acquired by my Department for the purposes of providing permanent accommodation for schools are generally green-field sites and the school buildings provided thereon remain in the ownership of the Minister or the relevant VEC. In the case of PPP projects the Minister also retains ownership of both the site and school building.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	579	I am conscious of the workload issues affecting Principal teachers and am aware of the key role they play in determining the shape of our schools.The scheme of release time for principals enables teaching principals of primary schools to be released from their teaching duties for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative leadership and management functions.  The number of days release time allowed varies between 14 and 22 and is determined by the number of mainstream class teachers in the school.  Paid substitution is provided by my Department for the days that Principals are on release time.In the 2005/2006 school year my Department, following consultation with the relevant education interests, introduced on a pilot basis, a system whereby a fully qualified primary school teacher may be employed to act as a nominated substitute teacher for the Principals in a cluster of schools taking release days.  Twenty clusters have been established under the pilot scheme.As part of the Programme for Government there is a commitment to increase the number of release days for teaching principals and to also expand the pilot scheme for substitute cover for principal release days.  It is intended that progress on these commitments will be made during the lifetime of the programme having regard also to the need for overall prudent financial management of the economy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	580	Since 2003 the Leadership Development for Schools Programme (LDS) has expanded the range of supports and services that it offers to school leaders and over 8000 teachers from principals to middle managers have successfully completed LDS module programmes such as Misneach, Spreagagh, Forbairt, Tánáiste, Cumasú and Cothú.  This investment has now led us to a point where there are structured professional development opportunities for all school leaders in our system from their point of appointment to day of retirement.In June 2008 my Department will be launching "Toraíocht" a Programme for Aspiring Leaders.  Such a programme is both timely and necessary in the provision of high quality leadership to meet future challenges.  The Tóraíocht Programme is designed, delivered and assessed by one of our Programmes LDS (Leadership Development For Schools) and NUI Maynooth.  It is an accredited course at post-graduate diploma.  The course is open to any teacher, primary or post-primary with a minimum of four years teaching experience who aspires to be a future Principal at some stage of their career.  The course will begin in September 2008.

The purpose of these discussions is to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from the management structure in schools to assist school authorities in the running of schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Work on the development of a Learner Database at Primary Level is continuing.  A Feasibility Study has been undertaken in relation to the use of a single data portal or gateway to facilitate schools in relation to data transmission to my Department and a number of associated agencies.  The results of this Study will be considered along with options for the development of a single Database to cover Primary and Post-Primary.  It is expected that the first phase of this will extend to Primary level once the necessary specification, user-testing and training has been undertaken.The timing of the implementation of the Database depends on available resources and the management of competing priorities.  However, in line with the Programme of Government and the Data Strategy of my Department, and taking advantage of the existing Education Services Interactive (esinet) portal already used by schools to access the On-Line Claims System, I am fully committed to the development of such a Database as a means of better quality information on pupils as well as reducing the administrative burden on schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	583	In recognition of the responsibility which the Education Act has imposed on Boards of Management and the increasingly complex environment in which they must operate, the Teacher Education Section (TES) of my Department has developed a scheme for the provision of support to school management bodies for the purpose of training and development of boards of management in the discharge of their duties and consistent with national and DES priorities.This scheme, which is administered through Drumcondra Education Centre has significant input from the representative bodies from both the Primary and Post-Primary Sector.  The essential core areas covered in the training are Financial Management, Child Protection Guidelines, Health & Safety and Employment and HR.  Other areas to be covered in training include Background Information re: Education System, Role and Function of the Board, How a BOM Operates, Policies and Procedures.  The representative bodies may provide training in additional areas which they identify pertaining to their respective areas.The new boards of management appointed in late 2007, to which the Deputy refers are predominantly in the primary sector.  Consequently, a training of trainers session was held earlier this year by the School Development Planning Service, using materials and supports developed by the SDP.  This session was tailored for trainers selected by the various primary school management bodies to provide direct training to Boards of Management.  A further training for trainers day will be held in the Autumn.

Over €2.6 billion has been provided for school building infrastructure between 2000 and 2006 and a further €4.5 billion is to be invested under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Close to €600m of this will be provided this year alone.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension PE facilities are included as an intrinsic part of the design.At primary level, Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas and is an intrinsic element of the Primary School Curriculum.  A revised curriculum in physical education at primary level was introduced in September 2005 supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers.  The programme provides for six strands of activity — athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics.  Five of the strands are outlined for implementation for each of the four class groupings, junior and senior infants, 1st and 2nd class, 3rd and 4th class, and 5th and 6th class.  The aquatics strand is designed to be implemented at one or more levels, depending on the availability of facilities.  The recommended minimum timeframe set out for PE at primary level is one hour per week.  All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.The PE curriculum has been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.  Many primary schools have a general purpose room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for teaching different aspects of the PE programme.  A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.Primary schools received €2000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million.  In addition, since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.  Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.The extent and quality of local sports facilities has been improved dramatically in recent years, with more than €450 million invested by the Government since 1998 in over 5,000 projects through the Sports Capital Programme.  At the same time, PE, general purpose and outdoor play facilities have been provided for schools all over the country through the School Building Programme.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, the Government is working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.

The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered in the school timetable.  The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.A revised syllabus in Physical Education as a non examinable subject at Junior cycle was introduced in post primary schools in September 2003 and implemented on a phased basis over the period to 2005.  No implementation dates have been set as yet for further reforms in this area.Curriculum support services provide training and school based support for teachers.  School-based support is a very rich form of support and allows the teacher explore the possibilities and limitations of the environment in which they teach.  Through modelling of lessons and professional dialogue, the quality of teaching is enhanced and teachers are further enabled to develop their teaching skills.  Teachers must also aim to include all students in PE lessons — irrespective of gender, or physical and/or learning deficits.  The  PE Association of Ireland have been active in organising conferences where teachers can avail of an opportunity to witness the latest thinking in physical education, and my Department also funds programmes on PE through the network of education centres.This Government has worked hard to improve the opportunities for young people to get physical exercise both in school and in their local communities.  In a new school building or refurbishment/extension, PE facilities are included as part of the design.  Between 2000 and 2006 a total of 516 large-scale projects were delivered in primary and post-primary schools by the Department as part of a record overall investment of €2.6 billion in modernising primary and post-primary school facilities throughout the country.  Many more large-scale projects are under construction or due to go to construction in the near future.  New PE equipment such as balancing benches and gym mats are funded as part of any major building programme.A special PE funding package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools in 2007, providing a grant of €4,000 per school towards the cost of replacing and upgrading PE equipment.  This grant was issued, as a once-off measure, to enable schools to replace older equipment such as goalposts, PE mats, benches etc.So, through an increased focus on exercise in school and in the community, we are working to encourage more children and young people to get active.  Indeed, the ‘State of the Nation's Children' report published by the Minister for Children recently, found that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries in being physically active for at least 4 hours per week.

New curricula for PE in primary schools and at Junior Cert level have also been put in place.Since 2000 my Department has provided in excess of €5.5m in grant-aid to primary schools to facilitate the provision of coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education.  Such materials and equipment would normally have a useful life of several years.In addition Primary schools received €2,000 each in PE equipment grants in 2006, at a total cost of €6.5 million.  A similar grant of €4,000 per pupil, at an overall cost of around €3 million, issued to post-primary schools in 2007.The payment of future PE equipment grants will arise for consideration in the context of the funding available for my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  I am not in a position at this stage to say when such grants will be paid.

This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year.As a result of the decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision has been put in place from the commencement of the 2005/06 school year.  This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the Free Education/Block Grant Schemes, the level of allocation ranges from 8 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.  The additional posts included provision for a further improvement in the allocation of Guidance hours for post-primary schools participating in the DEIS programme — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools.  The allocation for these schools now ranges from 11 hours per week for schools with enrolments below 300 to 55 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more.In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to increase the level of guidance within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads.The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students.  SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.In February of 2007, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level.  Due for its second phase in February of this year, the programme is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons.  The 2007 campaign covered walking to school safely, in 2008 the campaign is focused around the topic of Cycling to School Safely.  A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007.  It covers road safety across 9 topics — walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety, to be delivered over nine class periods.In addition, a Road Safety programme for Transition Year, developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second level Support Service is being piloted in schools in the current school year for rollout in the 2008/09 school year.This programme was launched on 29th April 2007 in collaboration with the Road Safety Authority, and applications have been issued to schools inviting them to participate in the programme from September next.My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.

In addition to this targeted training, CAPP continues to offer training and support to all new Designated Liaison Persons (DLPs) and Deputy DLPs.In the 2007/2008 school year it is anticipated that CAPP will have provided training to approximately 615 schools, over 5,000 teachers and 1,100 special needs assistants.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Section 27 of the Education Act 1998 provides that Boards of Management in second level schools shall facilitate and give all reasonable assistance to Student Councils.  Student Councils are established in the majority of post-primary schools.  It is important not only to ensure that each school has a Student Council which is representative of all students in the school but also that Councils are given a meaningful role in school decision-making.The Act provides that Boards shall have procedures for the purposes of informing students of the activities of the school and to facilitate the involvement of students in the operation of the school, having regard to the age and experience of the students, in association with their parents and teachers.An active Student Council can be a most effective way to involve students in the affairs of the school, in cooperation with the board, parents and teachers.In 2002, my Department issued guidelines on the establishment and operation of Student Councils, ‘Student Councils: A Voice for Students'. In November 2005, a curriculum development project on the setting up and development of Student Councils, entitled Giving Young People a Voice, through the Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE) curriculum was established. This was a partnership project between the Office for the Minister for Children and the Curriculum Development Unit of City of Dublin VEC. The Project has assisted and supported schools, teachers and students in the establishment of effective Student Councils in schools through the development and piloting of a teaching and learning resource for the CSPE curriculum. It is important that schools engage with the issues which Student Councils themselves highlight as matters of concern.In post-primary schools where Student Councils have been established, my Department's Inspectorate meets with the representatives of the students during a whole-school evaluation. This meeting is intended to provide the students' representatives with opportunities to give an account of their participation in school life, their achievements during the year, how they manage meetings, who they communicate with and how and to talk about some of the issues that have been raised at meetings. Students' views are also sought on the atmosphere of the school and the extent to which students are involved in decision-making.In September 2007 my Department appointed a Student Council Co-ordinator to design and deliver a programme of professional development to respond to identified needs and to support Student Council Liaison teachers and schools involved in establishing and developing effective Student Councils at second-level. The Student Council Co-ordinator works within the CSPE Support Service with specific responsibility for Student Councils.The second level support service of my Department is providing training at national, regional, local and school level for both the liaison teachers and the Student Councils. The purpose of this training is to develop effective student councils. Support is also being provided to encourage the networking of Student Councils.In relation specifically to Boards of Management, the advice being delivered at in-service and in schools is that Student Councils should be proactive in engaging with the Boards of Management of their schools.They should present their reviewed Constitution to the Board of Management for ratification every year, soon after the elections.The students are being encouraged keep the Board updated on meetings and issues by sending agendas and minutes to the Board through the Secretary which is usually the Principal of a school.Reports should be sent regularly to the Board and the Student Council should look to meet with the Board a minimum of twice a year, at the beginning and at the end.Funding applications for needs identified in the school or for the day to day running of the Student Council should also be made directly to the Board.Student Councils are being encouraged to evaluate the year's work. This would include asking the Board, school staff, students and the parents' associations, to evaluate their engagement with the Council during the year.Resources are currently being developed to support the Liaison Teachers in their work with the Student Councils one of which will specifically address the practical needs of the Student Council in e.g. how to present and draw up plans, proposals, funding applications, the constitution, reports etc. to the Boards of Management.  This resource will be presented to Liaison Teachers at national in-service for consultation and review, prior to dissemination to schools.

T.D.  welcomed the embedding of core skills, the inclusion of a second assessment component, and the moves to standardise transition units. She asked that change be implemented on a phased basis over a significant period of time, minimising disruption, taking account of logistical and cost factors and system capacity to change. The Minister asked the NCCA to prioritise the reconfiguration of subjects generally within the Leaving Certificate in order to embed key skills, and to provide for a second assessment component. She indicated her concern the TYP should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons. On short courses, she asked the NCCA to develop as an exemplar a short course in Enterprise Education, building on the existing Links Modules, so that the Department could better assess the implementation issues.The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools.  A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed.  Reforms are under way in Irish to strengthen oral competence and to increase the proportion of marks for the oral examinations to 40% for all new entrants beginning second level in 2007/8.Reform in Mathematics Education at junior and senior cycle is also beginning on a phased basis. This will start in 24 project schools with effect from 2008/9, and will begin in mainstream schools from September 2010.  The reforms are designed to provide a bridging framework from the revised primary curriculum into second level, promote greater maths literacy across the school population, bring changed emphasis in the mathematics learnt and, in particular, a strong focus on context and applications and problem solving and a greater ICT dimension, encourage greater take up at higher level, and provide a solid foundation which prepares students for careers in science, technology, engineering, business or humanities options.  For schools involved in the initial implementation from September 2008, students will experience mathematics in a new way. Teachers will be provided with classroom materials to enable them to adopt the new approaches and will be supported professionally in embracing change. These materials and supports will include lesson plans, with teacher guides and student worksheets, on-line exemplars and a range of assessment materials.  Examination questions will also be changed for these students.Recommendations are expected shortly from the NCCA in regard to senior cycle science subjects, and a number of short courses and Transition units. Work is also at an advanced stage in regard to proposals for the subjects Social Personal and Health Education and Politics and Society in senior cycle, but proposals in this area have not as yet been submitted to my Department.

The Council proposed the development of Transition Units as 45 hour units of study which would provide a broad range of experiences for learners, incorporating innovative methodologies and supporting the development of key skills. The Council proposed that school based assessment would be inbuilt into each transition unit, and models for the validation of schools to develop their own Transition Units would be explored.  The units would cover such areas of learning as creative applications, skills, personal achievement, sampling of subjects, enterprise, civic and social education, and work and future.In response, the then Minister Mary Hanafin TD welcomed the measures to standardise transition units,  and indicated her concern that the Transition Year Programme should remain as a single year programme for equity reasons.The NCCA has established a network to undertake development work with schools.  A standardised framework for Transition Unit descriptors has been developed, and organisations are using these as new programme options for TYP are being developed.  The decriptors are designed to promote better planning and communication and provide for greater clarity and coherence in the implementation of the programme. They require schools to set out the aims of the unit, its learning outcomes, how key skills are being integrated, what methodologies and assessment approaches will be taken and how it will be evaluated.New Transition Units have been developed and posted to the NCCA website in a range of areas and a guide has been produced to help schools to develop their own units in keeping with the descriptor format. Schools may forward their Transition Units to the NCCA for further feedback and support.

Provision of science facilities is an intrinsic part of all major projects at post-primary level. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science. Under the current NDP €4.5 billion will be spent on school infrastructure between 2007 and 2013.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Schemes 2004 -2007 to refurbish science laboratories.  In the 2006 application form for the Summer Works Scheme, post-primary schools were asked to identify specifically, and provide details of, any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for, so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006. Over 60 schools were approved for funding in 2006 and 2007 under my Department's Summer Works Scheme to enable them to get science laboratories refurbished on a devolved basis.Additionally, the Government has funded the provision of class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences. My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding.The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	594	Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.Recently devised syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability. The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils.Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.In addition, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment, has produced draft guidelines for teachers of exceptionally able students. These guidelines issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback. Over the last few months the NCCA has sought feedback on the draft guidelines from teachers, school management and other interested individuals and organisations.These draft guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. They feature ways in which teaching and learning can be effectively differentiated for such students, in particular how learning skills can be embedded in increasingly complex content. Case studies included in the guidelines present rich real-life contexts which consider the issues around exceptionality through the eyes of teachers, parents and students.My Department provides annual funding to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes, which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age. Of particular significance at second level are the International Olympiads in the science subjects, in information technology and in mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete.The 1998 Education Act requires Boards of Management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.

Participation in the programme is supported by an enhanced  pupil:teacher ratio and a once-off per capita grant. 138 DEIS schools are currently providing the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme, and 370 centres are offering the programme overall, including 46 out of school centres of education. All DEIS schools are being encouraged to provide the LCA by 2010. An invitation to participate in the programme is issued to all schools each year.

Children's command of Irish is improved through participation in a range of activities, including music, arts and crafts and games, conducted through the medium of Irish. The programmes are developed by teachers working to guidelines produced by the Department of Education and Science.A grant of €5,420 is paid to each participating school to cover the project costs. In 2008, funding of €150,000 has been provided to cover the costs of training the teachers and project costs for participating schools.The Gaeltacht Scholarship scheme has also been established. It is designed to enable children enrolled in designated disadvantaged post-primary schools to attend approved summer colleges for teaching Irish.Funding of €100,000 has been made available for the scheme for 2008.  Applications for the 2008 scheme are still being processed and, to date, approximately 100 have been received.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment.  This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. It will be supported by a website which will provide exemplars of teaching and learning in different settings, and show the classroom application of learning outcomes and demonstrations in the ICT framework. The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.The European Computer Driving Licence is a widely used private sector qualification providing basic competences in a range of functions such as word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, web browsing and e mail.  There are also other qualifications attesting to similar or higher levels of skill, some of which are included in the national framework of qualifications.  The 2005 census of post primary and special schools undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that 75.7% of schools, and 46%  of special schools offered certification opportunities in ICT.   74% of post primary schools and 32% of special schools offered external certification, primarily using ECDL. Other awards in ICT offered included FETAC, City and Guilds, Royal Society of Arts, Microsoft etc. Many schools offer ECDL as part of the Transition Year Programme.

As a result of the identification and review processes, 873 schools have been included in the new School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. These comprise 670 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.The plan is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.  The following progress has been made in relation to the roll out of the action plan.  In respect of the 2007/08 school year, grants amounting to approximately €10 million issued to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative. Almost €5 million was paid in the course of the year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes.  Also approximately another 1,900 primary schools received almost €4 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.2006 saw the implementation of targeted class size reductions of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.In the 2006/2007 school year access to teacher/co-ordinator support for any of the rural primary schools, not already in receipt of such support under a previous measure, was implemented.The roll-out has seen the extension of literacy and numeracy programmes, including Reading Recovery and ready set go, maths for schools in the urban primary strand of DEIS and the commencement of the family literacy project under which 7 projects have been selected for support.25 schools have been selected to join the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) in  2008, which is in addition to the 28 schools which joined the JCSP programme in September 2007.  138 DEIS schools are currently providing the Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) programme. It is intended to have all DEIS schools providing LCA by 2010.Templates for three year action plans to support school planning were introduced into schools in the primary strand of DEIS during autumn 2007.  Planning templates will be introduced in DEIS post primary schools in the coming school year. My Department has commenced an evaluation of measures under DEIS that will continue over the period to 2010.Under DEIS, Home/School/Community liaison and School Completion Programme services have been extended to any of the urban/town primary schools and second-level schools not already benefiting from them.An additional 80 posts were provided under DEIS for the expansion of HSCL and in the region of €30 million has been allocated to HSCL for 2008. 184,000 pupils attending 651 schools (281 post primary & 370 primary) have access to Home School Community Liaison, with approx. 50,000 of these pupils' families being specifically targeted for the services of 450 local Home School Community Liaison Co-ordinators.€31.160 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme. 124 projects, targeting over 36,000 young people, are now participating in the School Completion Programme and spanning 26 counties.The 124 projects include 81 projects originally selected to participate in SCP in 2002 and 43 new SCP clusters created in 2006/07 including the new DEIS schools. An evaluation of the SCP is scheduled to take place in 2008 in order to measure the effectiveness of interventions in place in tackling early school leaving, to identify models of good practice and to inform future policy in relation to appropriate integration of SCP, along with other programmes, within the DEIS framework.

Grants of €1.65m and €1.7m  issued to schools in December 2006  and December 2007 for the cost of test materials, teachers' manuals, test scoring services or test-related software. It is intended that the implementation of standardised testing at school level will be complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time. Schools in the DEIS programme have already been sampled by the Educational Research Centre for this purpose, and the sample of non-Deis English and Irish medium schools is planned for 2009.Guidelines on assessment developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were published in October 2007 to assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents. The guidelines also provide teachers with information on what to assess in individual subjects of the Primary School Curriculum and how to use assessment information to plan for children's future learning in that subject.National report card templates  for recording and reporting data on pupils' attainment to parents will be available on the NCCA website shortly.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 455 together.As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.The recently published document Special Needs Education — A Continuum of Support, which has been circulated to all primary school teachers, outlines this process which moves from simple classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions. These guidelines describe a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools and comprise three distinct school based processes which are summarised as follows:Classroom Support — is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,School Support — is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.School Support Plus — is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels.Since May 2007 the number of psychologists employed within the NEPS service nationally has increased from 128 to 138 and during 2008 this complement will increase to 169. In this regard, following a national recruitment process, put in place in late 2007 by the Public Appointments Service, interviews have recently been completed and regional panels have been formed from which recruits will be drawn for appointment to priority regions. Currently some 28 offers have been made and some 21 of these are currently subject to the garda vetting process.As these candidates are recruited, and following the normal period of induction and work-shadowing, these psychologists will be assigned schools with particular emphasis on those with DEIS status, continuing the ongoing priority afforded by the service to designated disadvantage schools.It is my Department's intention to increase NEPS psychologist personnel to 200 during 2009. It is envisaged that this expansion in NEPS numbers will enable all schools to be served directly by NEPS psychologists.NEWBAn additional 15 staff were approved for the NEWB in 2007 to bring the authorised staffing complement for the Board to 109. Twelve of these additional posts have now been filled. The Board is currently in the process of filling the remaining  posts. These additional posts will enable the Board to build upon the existing service and enhance service delivery.The service provided by the NEWB is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to support schools, families and young people themselves. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.Work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration. This approach aims to develop the delivery of services in a cohesive way and ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 to 458, inclusive, and 471 together.As the Deputies will be aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs. Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.When the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, was enacted it was recognised that implementation would require a considerable change agenda, in order to further develop and support inclusive schools as the cornerstone of special education needs provision.The National Council for Special Education was required under the Act to make a report on the implementation of the Act. Following consideration of the issues raised in the Council's implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, it is envisaged that the five year timeframe to 2010 acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act in full.My Department is at an advanced stage in finalising proposals to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEP). The time taken to finalise proposals is as a result of the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act and define protocols and guidelines in regard to how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts.As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced. My Department's priority, therefore, is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.In parallel with these processes, my Department has also advanced a number of areas relevant to the implementation of EPSEN:proposals for pre-school services developedestablishment of the Standards Bodyrecruitment of additional staff for the Council and staffing review of the NCSEappointment of Chairperson and members to the Special Education Appeals Boardrecruitment of educational psychologistsreview of the scheme for commissioning private assessmentspublication of agreed standards for assessmentcontributing to assessments under the Disability ActIt must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.With regard to second level provision, the Programme for Government commits to improve post-primary provision for children with special educational needs. Inclusive mainstream education is now the desire of the vast majority of parents and the inclusion of children with a range of additional needs is a growing issue for all schools, including those at post-primary level. My Department considers that the process of implementing the EPSEN Act is an appropriate framework in which to further develop the continuum of appropriate provision for post-primary age children. Specific proposals are being developed to advance post-primary provision for students with special education needs in this context.The Deputy may wish to note that the development of the "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" published by my Department's Inspectorate in June 2007 is a further component of the preparation for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act in post-primary level schools. These guidelines, which were circulated to all second level schools, advocate a whole-school approach to effectively meet the educational needs of special needs students. Practical advice and guidance are provided on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.Furthermore, in preparation for the statutory introduction of the individual education plan (IEP), the NCSE has published guidelines on the IEP process and a copy issued to all primary and post primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year. These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans. It is intended that schools will use these guidelines to develop school practices and procedures in relation to individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	603	This Government has significantly exceeded its commitment to provide 1,800 Language Support Teachers, as outlined in the Programme for Government.  My Department has already allocated almost 2,000 language support teachers in the current school year. The corresponding figures for the 2006/07 and 2005/06 school years are approximately over 1,400 and over 800 respectively.Additional supports are provided for children in schools who do not meet the qualifying criteria for the appointment of full-time teachers in the form of grant aids for the employment of part-time English language support teachers. 469 schools have benefited from this type of financial support in the current school year.The substantial increase in the number of language support teachers underlines the important improvements made in this area in recent years. The previous limit of two teachers per primary school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil was changed. An individual primary school may now be allocated up to six language support posts under the improved arrangements in place.In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.

Funds are allocated to VECs who are the main statutory providers of ESOL training.  Currently, there are approximately 100 VEC colleges, 10 Prison Education providers, 100 Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) colleges, 100 Youthreach centres and some community groups providing ESOL classes.Between 1997 and 2007, funding for adult literacy has increased from €1m to €30m and in the same period, the number of participants has increased from 5,000 to 44,000.  Of these 44,000 participants, some 13,000 are ESOL students.An independent review has been commissioned to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. This is due for completion in summer 2008.

Provision has been made in the Revised Estimates for 2008 for the allocation of an additional 500 places in 2008.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time Further Education programmes for adults to give them an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. Programmes are offered on a part-time basis, in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.There is a commitment in the programme for government to expand the number of  BTEI places to 10,000. 1,000 additional BTEI places were allocated in 2007 bringing the number of BTEI places to 9,000.  Funding has been made available in 2008  for an additional 500 places.Since its inception, funding for the BTEI has increased from just over €6m in 2002 to €18m in 2007. BTEI eligibility criteria were amended to allow free tuition to any adult with less than upper second level education with effect from 1st September 2007. Originally only people with a social welfare entitlement or medical card were entitled to free fees.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme provides a full-time education option for people who are over 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  The Government remains committed to increase the number of places on VTOS as outlined in the Programme for Government.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The youth work sector has received unprecedented financial support over the past number of years. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidating current provision.The 2008 provision of €52.6m for Youth Affairs will enable the high level of provision achieved over recent years to be maintained as well as a continued focus on the further consolidation of existing provision.With regard to the National Youth Work Development plan, steady progress has been made in the implementation of a number of priority actions, as identified by the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. These include areas such as Child Protection, upgrade of one worker projects to two-worker status, the establishment of a North/South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the capacity development of youth work organisations to engage with the provisions of the Youth Work Act, 2001. Ongoing support is being provided in respect of these and other initiatives.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, Section 1 provides for sections to be commenced at different stages. Sections 2-7, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced to date.A sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC), representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors as well as of my Department, has been progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further coherent implementation of the Act. The work of this sub-committee is continuing.Significant progress has been made since 2006 in the roll out of the Act at local level. This includes the assignment of Youth Officers and related financial support to the VEC sector.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	609	As the Deputy will be aware, Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, provides for consideration to be given to the need for a further plan following a review in 2008 of the National Youth Work Development Plan 2003-2007. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to supporting a new Youth Work Development Plan for the period 2008-2012.In that context, as part of its workplan for 2008, the National Youth Work Advisory Committee (NYWAC) is undertaking a review of the 2003-2007 Plan and is in the process of commencing this work. The outcomes of this review and any other relevant advice and information will help inform me and my Department in relation to the above provisions.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	610	Over the seven years of the National Development Plan (NDP) €13 billion will be invested under the Human Capital Priority to develop the capacity of the higher education sector to meet a number of key national objectives, including that of increasing the numbers of students participating in the sector. The focus will continue from the previous NDP on measures targeting the increased participation of under-represented student groups, such as those from disadvantaged areas and older learners.The recurrent grant to higher education institutions supports the core activities and services of all state-aided third level institutions, including the development of access programmes, the objective of which is to encourage and support the increased access and retention of young people and adults from disadvantaged schools and communities. Funding also supports measures targeting the progression of learners from the further and community education sector, people with a disability and members of the traveller community.It has been over a decade since targeted access funding was introduced to the budgets of third level institutions. While the investment is, by its nature, a long-term one it is fair to say that so far there have been some very positive outcomes. For example, since 1998 the semi and unskilled manual group, who are a long-standing priority target group have increased their participation by at least 10%. An estimated one-third of young people from these backgrounds now enter higher education.In addition to the core funding of institutions, innovative new initiatives on the part of third level institutions to increase levels of access and lifelong learning are also being supported by the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF). Over the course of the NDP it is planned that €510 million will be allocated to third level institutions through this fund. As a first step, in 2007 an allocation of €42 million was made and in 2008 under the second cycle of funding a further €130 million was allocated.This funding is supporting some interesting new collaborations on the part of networks of higher-education institutions focusing on the needs of learners from disadvantaged communities. A number of projects aim to significantly increase part-time and flexible learning opportunities for adults who wish to develop their levels of education and skills.Having invested in infrastructure and strategies to ensure a more diverse and representative student body, it is equally important to ensure that those students are adequately supported in their participation. The Social Inclusion Priority of the NDP commits that €2 billion will be dedicated over the period 2007-13 to address inequities in participation by students from socio-economically disadvantaged groups (including members of the travelling community and refugees); students with a disability and mature students. This funding underpins the allocations that will be made through the Higher Education Grant scheme as well as the significant reforms to that scheme that are proposed by the Student Support Bill.This priority also encompasses the Third Level Access Sub-Programme, which includes the annual allocations through three funds: the Fund for Students with a Disability, the Student Assistance Fund and the Millennium Partnership Fund. This measure also supports the work of the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education which manages these three funds on behalf of my Department and advises national policy on access to higher education for under-represented groups.A new "access plan", which will run concurrently with the National Development Plan (from 2008-2013), is currently being prepared. The plan will examine emerging issues and challenges, including progression from further to higher education. It will highlight ongoing and new areas of action, including work with institutions on the development of an ‘access plan' as an integral element of the overall strategic planning process.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce a new system of means-tested free fees for approved part-time courses will be considered over the life time of the Government.  In relation to the commitment on part time fees in paragraph 7.9 of Towards 2016, my Department and the HEA have initiated the process of developing proposals for a targeted fund, to be financed from the National Training Fund, to support workers pursuing part-time courses at third level in public institutions.  In developing criteria for the operation of the fund regard will be given to the following objectives:targeting people in work who have not had the opportunity to pursue third level education previously to level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework;reducing the amount of fees that workers pay;maintaining the current benefits in relation to employer support and tax relief available to workers in respect of third level fees; andallowing for a part refund to be paid on successful completion of each academic year of the relevant course.The criteria for accessing the fund will be developed in close consultation with other stakeholders.  My Department will be initiating these consultations in the coming weeks.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	612	In 2007, in consultation with stakeholders, the National Qualifications Authority Ireland reviewed the extent to which new and existing transfer and progression routes are operating effectively within the National Framework of Qualifications. This review concluded that the traditional web of transfer and progression arrangements prior to the Framework is gradually evolving to take account of the changes arising from the introduction of the Framework.  The NQAI has since then examined in more detail the progression routes available.The NQAI's overall objective in this area, as articulated in its policies, is to ensure that there is at least one transfer or progression route onwards from every programme leading to an award in the National Framework of Qualifications; that these routes are mapped and documented; and, that information on transfer and progression routes is made available to learners.Significant improvement has been made in the acceptance of many Level 5 Certificates for progression to programmes in the Institutes of Technology leading to higher education awards. Work is underway in relation to the acceptance of the full range of Level 5 Certificates as valid for this progression route. Progression arrangements from the Level 5 Certificate to programmes in the universities are less developed and are still in the form of specific programme-to-programme links. This is a situation where significant progress has been made in recent years and positive future development is anticipated.The arrangements for transfer and progression from those Advanced Certificates formerly known as the National Craft Certificate are currently being developed. FETAC is in the process of finalising a publication setting out the routes available into programmes provided by the institutes of technology. Work is also underway within the SIF 1 strand on education in employment — in a consortium of higher education institutions led by Cork Institute of Technology a strand on apprentice progression is to be completed by December 2008. Linked work on a new programme at level 7 which will provide another progression route for holders of the Advanced Certificate is also underway in FÁS.The main route of access to third level each year continues to be the school-leaving certificate (including access programme entrants and entrants with school-leaving qualifications from other countries).A growing number of students are also gaining access through two other main routes: on the grounds of mature years (12% of entrants); on the basis of further education awards (10% of entrants).The proportion of entrants with further education award has grown significantly from almost 3% of acceptances in 2005 to almost 10% in 2007.  This is an important access route for adult learners who form at least half the participants in the further-education sector.The NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the Higher Education Authority continue, in their policy documents, discussions with partners and funding of institutions (HEA) to promote and support increased progression and participation on the basis of awards linked to the framework of qualifications. The evidence of increased progression by further education graduates to higher education, particularly over the last two years would indicate that the concerted efforts of all of these bodies are now bearing fruit.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, an envelope of close to €2 billion has been provided for investment in higher education infrastructure. At the end of the first year of the programme, implementation of this measure is progressing satisfactorily with 2007 funding used to deliver additional capacity for apprentices in 4 institutes of technology as well as equipping institutes to enable the implementation of revised curricula for apprentices. Funding was also deployed to enable a series of minor improvements works be carried out within the sector. Sites purchases were grant aided, design costs of major projects in planning were funded and large scale projects at construction were similarly supported.A sample of some large scale projects at construction that were funded include an new IT Building at National University of Ireland Cork, new Tourism and Hospitality facility at Waterford Institute of Technology, refurbishment of facilities at Limerick Institute of Technology and necessary improvements works to Dublin Institute of Technology facilities. Pipeline projects for which design costs were incurred include a new Engineering building at Athlone Institute of Technology, redevelopment of primary teacher training facilities at St Patrick's College Drumcondra and phase 2 of the Mary Immaculate College of Education project, a new library at Tralee Institute of Technology and expanded facilities at Dundalk Institute of Technology. In addition, 17 individual projects are being progressed for delivery through the public private partnership process.The Deputy will be aware that the €2 billion referred to above is separate and discrete from planned investments in building and expanding research capacity and capabilities in higher education institutions. In this regard, NDP capital funding of over €750m has been allocated. In 2007, this funding enabled the introduction of a dedicated research equipment grant as well as the launch and approval of awards under Cycle 4 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions. Cycle 4 has a capital component of €108m which will be disbursed across 13 higher education institutions and involving 36 individual capital projects that are targeted to deliver over 20,000 m2 of new research facilities. In the current year, the Research Facilities Enhancement Scheme has already been successfully launched where €58m of capital investment is targeted at improving and refurbishing existing research provision within higher education institutions in the course of the year.Annual funding is set to increase significantly from its 2008 level of €184.4m to €320m in 2009 and beyond  for conventionally procured projects.

The composition of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is set out in Section 6 of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, and provides for one representative of learners. The Authority is committed to working in a participative manner and engages extensively with student and other stakeholder interests as an integral part of its work, through a variety of consultative fora.

Central to this is the "Special Education Support Service" (SESS). The Teacher Education Section of my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) in September 2003. The service consolidates co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.The CPD provided by the SESS covers a range of specialities, including inter alia:Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)DyslexiaChallenging BehaviourPost-primary issues in Special Educational NeedsSpecialist training for Autism Units attached to schools. As part of an initiative rolled out for the 08/09 school year, teachers can have SESS training in the area of ASDs accredited by St Angela's College in Sligo.In addition, Teacher Education Section funds several third level courses in teacher training colleges and universities.

Under VTOS, full-time courses of one or two years duration are provided to participants to enhance their employability.The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time Further Education programmes for adults to give them an opportunity to combine a return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. People with disabilities are one of the target groups of the programme.Adults with disabilities may also avail of adult literacy courses provided by VECs around the country.  A grant has been provided to the Irish Deaf Society to train tutors to give literacy tuition and a grant is awarded annually the Dyslexia Association of Ireland as a contribution towards assessments.An action research pilot project is continuing in a number of Further Education Colleges in the Dublin area. This  project is supported by two Disability Support Officers, the National Training and Development Institute and flexible additional funds for transport, equipment, interpreters, etc.  The service identifies and offers support to students and staff around the area of disability.  The provision of awareness-raising sessions and participation in college open and recruitment days is also an integral element of the role of the Support Officers.My Department is also currently working with the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD) to address special education needs of adults in further education.  In February of this year, AHEAD, in conjunction with the National Council for Guidance in Education (NCGE) launched a Handbook for Guidance and Information Officers on disability issues in Further Education.In June 2007, building on earlier conferences, a workshop on adults with intellectual disabilities was held at which key stakeholders shared their experiences and discussed possible ways forward for the development of services for people with intellectual disabilities.  A scoping paper on the parameters of provision for adults with disabilities in adult education and lifelong learning was commissioned and recently received.  This is now under consideration within the Department and will form part of the development of policy in this area.

Its primary purpose is to provide a dedicated multifunctional facility in which ministers and/or senior officials would convene to coordinate the response in the event of a major emergency.  The centre is equipped with the latest robust communications systems.The initial capital cost of providing the centre is approx €3.5 million.  The ongoing maintenance costs of running the centre will be in the order of €200,000 per annum.  The centre is available to all departments with an emergency planning/management role and is manned by those departments from their core staff as required.The design of the website "emergency planning.ie" formed part of the Public Information and Awareness Campaign on emergency planning which was launched recently.  The routine maintenance of the site is undertaken by the IT section of the Department of Defence.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I am very aware of the concerns of parents, teachers and voluntary organisations regarding the content available to children via the internet.  The establishment of the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) as an executive office within my Department will continue to build on the work of the Internet Advisory Board which was set up in February, 2002 following the Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful use of the Internet.  The Office became operational on 3 March 2008.  It will oversee and further develop the self-regulatory regime for the Irish internet service providers, encourage best practice procedures; promote awareness of the internet downside issues and provide advice and facilitate research on internet related issues regarding child safety.The OIS will also continue to oversee the operation of the Hotline (www.hotline.ie — the system for dealing with reports of illegal content on the internet). The Hotline is funded by the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan.  It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the internet.   It plays an important part by accepting reports, providing the resources to validate them and channel those that are illegal directly to the appropriate jurisdiction and authority.  If the material is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP) to remove it, in accordance with their Code of Practice and Ethnics.  Special protocols operate between the Gardaí and the Hotline that maximise cooperation on law enforcement issues.  The Hotline provides a first port of call for parents and members of the public in general who encounter illegal material on the internet.The Deputy may be aware of the booklets in the GET with IT! Series on behalf of the Internet Advisory Board (IAB).  The first booklet  "Get with IT" A Parents Guide to new media technologies is an update on the Board's first "Get with IT" booklet which was originally published in September, 2005 and was a major success. That booklet gave an overview of new technologies for parents in an effort to address their potential worries about the dangers of the new media for their children.The second booklet  "Get with IT" A Parents' Guide to filtering technologies helps parents navigate the processes of how to use filtering technology.   One of the more effective measures a parent can use to protect children from the dangers of illegal or harmful content on the internet is through the use of filtering software.  Filtering software is a program that ‘filters' out and blocks inappropriate internet content before children can see it on the computer screen.  Experience has shown that filtering tools are capable of filtering potentially harmful content without seriously degrading the internet experience of the youngster.  In most cases, computers will already have ‘filters' that one can use for free. All a person has to do is switch them on including options for downloading additional filtering software.   This booklet should assist parents in deciding on how to choose a particular package to suit their needs.A Parents' Guide to social-networking websites is the third in the GET with IT! series.  This booklet explains what social-networking websites are and how they operate in a simple user-friendly format.  This booklet will help parents to understand and use these websites, and help them to safeguard their children on-line.Copies of these publications were distributed widely and can be had on request through a freefone number 1800 24 25 95. They are also available on the website of my Department at <www.justice.ie> or from <www.internetsafety.ie>.

It will also provide that a minimum closure period of two days will apply in future in cases where a temporary closure order is imposed by the courts.The Government Legislation Programme provides for publication of a comprehensive Sale of Alcohol Bill later this year which will modernise and streamline all the laws relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2004, and replacing them with updated provisions. I intend to review and update the penalties for all licensing law offences in the context of that Bill.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision. Asylum seekers in direct provision avail of free full board accommodation with no utility or other costs associated with that accommodation. This cohort would include a number of persons who have made applications for leave to remain on, for example, humanitarian grounds. The direct provision allowance payment, detailed as follows, seeks to reflect the value of these services to the asylum seeker.In addition to meeting basic living costs, a direct provision allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child is paid by Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) operating on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.On 1 May 2004, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs introduced an Habitual Residency Condition which prohibited certain social welfare payments — child benefit or one parent family payment, for example — to a number of non-qualifying groups including asylum seekers. All persons applying for asylum from that date have been subject to the terms of the Habitual Residency Condition in respect of social welfare assessment.It continues to be open to any asylum seeker to apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance for a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.In addition to direct provision accommodation, the RIA operates a small number of ‘self-catering' accommodation units where residents receive a higher rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance through the Community Welfare Officer service, adjusted to take into account the benefit-in-kind of this accommodation which is rent free and free of utility and associated costs. This accommodation is specifically set aside for those with special needs, including special medical needs. As at 12 May 2008, there were 455 persons in such accommodation, comprising a number of family units and single persons to whom higher rates of SWA payment would apply. The full rate of SWA payment stands at €197.80 per week at the maximum personal rate (€131.30 for a qualified adult) with a €24 rate applying for a qualified child.As at 12 May 2008, the RIA was providing accommodation to 6,994 persons in 63 accommodation centres across 22 counties. Of the 6,994 persons accommodated, 6,539 were accommodated in standard direct provision accommodation to which the direct provision allowance payment (i.e. €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child) would apply.  Of these 6,539 persons, 4,416 were aged 18 years or older and would be entitled to payment at the adult rate while the remaining 2,123 would be entitled to payment at the child rate.Persons in direct provision accommodation qualify for the direct provision allowance payment and can apply for exceptional needs payments. Both payments are administered by the Community Welfare service on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  As indicated, in accordance with the Habitual Residency Condition referred to above, asylum seekers who arrived in the State since 1 May, 2004 are not entitled to any other social welfare payment.

Part 5 also provides a framework for monitoring the employment target in all public bodies by committees under the aegis of relevant Ministers of the Government. Under the Act, public bodies are required by 31 March each year to submit reports to monitoring committees on their compliance with the target; the monitoring committees are required to report on such compliance by 30 June each year to the relevant Minister and the National Disability Authority (NDA).The Department of Finance is responsible for monitoring the target in relation to all Government Departments and public bodies whose staff are civil servants.  In the case of other public bodies the target is monitored by the parent Department.  The NDA has an overall monitoring and reporting role under the Act.Last year the NDA prepared its first report under Part 5 of the Act on the employment position in 2006.  This report was submitted to the Minister of State with Responsibility for Disability and Mental Health, Dr. Jimmy Devins, T.D. who arranged for submission of it to the Government. The report was published by the NDA on 4 January 2008. The outturn figure of 5.3% was based on a staff census return rate of 45%.Following the first year of reporting under the Act, the process was reviewed by the NDA in consultation with my Department and other Government Departments, and revised reporting formats have been agreed and are currently being used to gather 2007 data.2007 data relating to public bodies are to be submitted to Ministers and the NDA by 30 June 2008. The NDA is then due to submit the second statutory report on the 3% employment target to the Minister of State by 30 November 2008 and that report will be forwarded to the Oireachtas library.

Donegal).The preparation of a fully costed business plan in respect of each Region is currently being addressed and, on receipt of financial approval, it is anticipated that a Garda Dog Unit will be established in the remaining four regions by mid 2009 and will comprise a selection of Drug, Explosive and General Purpose dogs.In the interval, the Garda Dog Unit based in the Dublin Metropolitan Region will continue to perform its national brief and respond to requests for operational assistance throughout the country.The Revenue's Customs Service also currently deploys 12 detector dogs teams.  In addition to performing searches for the Customs Service the detector dog teams are also used in Garda drugs searches, on request. The Sligo-based detector dog team is regularly called out to assist the Gardai in the North West region.The breakdown of deployment per Revenue region is as follows:Dublin Region — 6East/South East Region — 2South West Region — 3Border/Midlands/West Region — 1 (based in Sligo)10 of the detector dogs teams are used for drug detection. One is trained to detect tobacco. In response to the enhanced powers given to Customs in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 a cash detector dog team has been deployed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Provisions for controlling supply to and consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons under the age of 18 years are contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 and subsequent legislation.The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which I intend to bring before the Oireachtas shortly, will further strengthen provisions relating to underage drinking. For example, it will provide a statutory basis for test purchasing of alcohol which will assist the Gardaí in their enforcement activities. Parental approval will of course be required in all cases and appropriate safeguards will also be taken to protect the welfare of the young person concerned. The Bill will also provide for increases in fines for certain offences under the Licensing Acts, including the sale and supply of alcohol to persons under 18 years. Moreover, a minimum closure period of two days will apply in future in cases where a temporary closure order is imposed by the court.The Bill will also contain provisions permitting the Gardaí to seize alcohol from persons under 18 years where the Garda believes the alcohol is being or is to be consumed by persons under 18 years. In addition, the Gardaí will have new powers to seize alcohol and to move on persons found with alcohol where there is an apprehension of nuisance or fear for other persons or a likelihood of a breach of the peace. I am also taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to increase the fine levels in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. The Bill when enacted, will significantly increase the powers available to An Garda Síochána in tackling the problems caused by consumption of alcohol.The national age card scheme of An Garda Síochána has facilitated the Force, in co-operation with the licensed trade, in addressing and combating the problem of underage drinking. The age card scheme allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his/her local Garda Station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor.The new age card introduced in 2006 has state of the art security features. Its design has been greatly enhanced and includes an image security feature that is supplied only to Government projects worldwide. Currently there is no matching technology or method by which this technology can be copied.Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the power to set policing priorities for An Garda Síochána. One of the priorities set for 2008 is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, including behaviour warnings and closure orders.I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Encounter was commenced by the Commissioner in February, 2002 to target public disorder and anti-social behaviour against the community and local businesses. The Operation specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1996 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons.Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to the public order offences of intoxication in a public place (section 4) and disorderly conduct in a public place (section 5) as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance. I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of these provisions is under way with a view to their introduction as soon as possible this year.

It will provide, for example, that a certificate entitling the applicant to obtain a licence to sell alcohol shall not be granted by the Court unless it is satisfied that appropriate planning permission for the premises concerned has been obtained and that any conditions attached to such permission have been complied with.

Insofar as 2007 is concerned, the total amount of fees received by the Authority was €79.7m.  Cash expenditure on the Authority's Vote in that year was €41.5m.  As pointed out in the response to Parliamentary Questions 401 and 402 of 29 April 2008, however, it would be misleading to compare fee income with cash outlay only for the purposes of determining whether the Authority operate on a self-financing basis.  Any such determination would have to include the full costs, including indirect costs, of items such as pension provision, services from other Departments and so on.

Such firearms are subject to controls and require a firearms certificate for all users.  Adults using such firearms are required to hold a firearms certificate and use them in accordance with any conditions attached to their firearms certificate and current firearms legislation.  Where a muzzle energy is less than one joule these items do not fall within the definition of firearms in the Act and, accordingly, are not subject to such controls.

The scheme also offers pre-development grants of up to €5,000 to enable qualifying applicants to investigate the need for CCTV in their area and to complete a detailed proposal. Pobal administers the scheme on behalf of my Department and it carries out thorough assessments of all applications received. I have been informed by Pobal that an application for Stage 1 funding was received from a CCTV steering group in the area referred to. It was successful and a pre-development grant of €4,900 was paid in September 2007.It is intended to invite applications for funding under the Community-based CCTV Scheme on a periodic basis and it will be open to any group to submit an application for funding at that time. Further details of the scheme and the relevant documentation are available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie) or on Pobal's website (www.pobal.ie).An Garda Síochána operates a number of CCTV systems, mainly in the central areas of larger towns and cities.

In that regard, the needs of Newcastle West Garda District will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts throughout the country.

When enacted, these provisions will prove of assistance to home buyers in reducing conveyancing costs. In addition, the Government Legislation Programme as announced by the Chief Whip on 1 April 2008 includes the Legal Costs Bill.  The Scheme of the Bill being developed in my Department aims:to reform the manner in which disputed legal costs are assessed with the allied objective of making the market for civil legal services more predictable, consistent and transparent to consumersto provide for significant improvements in the quality and quantity of the information that a solicitor is required to provide to clients and the manner in which it is to be suppliedto ensure the litigant has a central role to play in controlling his or her legal costs and to ensure that the timely provision of information to clients is central to this empowerment.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Enforcement of road traffic legislation by the Garda Síochána is continuous and is planned and carried out in response to the developing situation with road traffic at national and local level and at different times.  The trend in fatal traffic collisions has been favourable over the past number of years.  The number of such collisions has decreased from 396 in 2005 to 365 in 2006 (a reduction of 8%) and to 338 in 2007 (a further reduction of 7%).  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 12 May, there were 102 road traffic fatalities in 2008, which represents a reduction of 23 on the same period last year.  While we should be cautious about drawing conclusions from developments over short periods of time, I welcome this continuation of the favourable trend, to which Garda enforcement activities have made a significant contribution.  This trend however should give no grounds for complacency.The Garda Síochána continue to focus their enforcement activities on the main causes of death and serious injury on the roads — drunk driving, speeding and the non-wearing of safety belts.  The continuing increase in the strength of the Garda Traffic Corps, which will reach its planned level of 1,200 by the end of this year, is enabling a continuing increase in enforcement activity to take place.  Along with the increase in its strength, a corresponding allocation of vehicles and other resources is being made to the Traffic Corps.Mandatory alcohol testing (MAT), which was introduced by the Road Traffic Act 2006, is increasing the compliance culture among road users.  By detecting incidents of drink-driving, it is reducing road traffic fatalities and deterring incidents of alcohol-impaired driving by systematically selecting drivers and assessing their level of alcohol related impairment.  MAT checkpoints operate in conjunction with general enforcement of drink driving legislation.With regard to speeding, the Garda Síochána are planning to replace their existing vehicle-based mobile speed detection systems this year.  They are also planning to introduce an automated number plate recognition capability in a range of Garda vehicles, which in addition to assisting in detecting suspect and untaxed vehicles will have a speed detection capability.In the recent past, the Garda Síochána have undertaken targeted campaigns directed at use of alcohol and drugs by drivers (December 2007), non-wearing of seatbelts (February 2008) and compliance by heavy goods vehicles (March 2008).  They will undertake further such campaigns and other initiatives, including specific operations at holiday periods, in the light of what is considered necessary.

Following a two stage tender and evaluation process, a preferred bidder has been identified.  The Government has confirmed that it will be proceeding with the outsourcing of a countrywide safety camera network and the financial resources necessary to do so will be provided.  It is expected that contract negotiations with the preferred bidder will commence imminently.  As the tender process is not concluded, I am not in a position to indicate at this time the completion date for the full roll-out of the safety camera network.In addition to the camera network, significant resources are being provided to enforce road traffic law and thereby increase road safety.  As well as the ongoing increase in personnel for the Traffic Corps, there has also been a significant increase in the financial resources provided for road traffic equipment, including for the replacement and upgrading of current mobile speed detection equipment and the introduction of an automated number plate recognition system.

This submission seeks to appeal the decision of my predecessor to refuse the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person in question.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that once an application for naturalisation is refused, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended does not provide for any such appeals process.  I further understand that the reasons my predecessor decided to refuse the said application were disclosed to the applicant in letters dated 3 July 2007 and 29 April 2008.It is open to the person in question to lodge a new application if and when he is in a position to satisfy the statutory requirements applicable at that time.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 31 May 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.The person concerned has also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the Subsidiary Protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will then be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  When this latter consideration has been completed, the case file of the person concerned will be passed to me for decision.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The Deputy is referring to a tragic incident that occurred on Ballymanus Strand, Donegal on 10th May 1943 in which 18 people tragically lost their lives.  This tragic incident was recently the subject of an adjournment debate in the Seanad on 23rd April 2008.Officials of my Department recently retrieved the file on this matter from the National Archives and the details of the incident were outlined in the Seanad debate.An inquest was held the day after the incident and, in view of requests for a special inquiry into the matter, the proceedings were adjourned.  Consideration was given at the time to holding an inquiry.  However, it seems from the file that there was little local demand for an inquiry into the matter at the time.  It was noted that a number of local representatives were of the view that nothing would be gained from an inquiry.  A meeting of local clergy apparently also came to the same conclusion.  A report on file states that a meeting of the next-of-kin of the deceased was held on the 24th of May 1943 and it was decided unanimously by them that no demand be made for an inquiry.  The Departments of Defence and Justice came to the conclusion that an inquiry would not serve any useful purpose.  The coroner was informed that no official inquiry was proposed and the inquest was reconvened on the 28th of May 1943.I am saddened by what happened, but it is very difficult, at this distance in time from the tragic event, to be able to pass judgement on the actions of the individuals or organisations involved.  With the 65th anniversary just passed, I can understand the enduring sadness of the families of those who were killed and injured.  As well as the suffering of the families involved, this was a terrible event for the local community and the grief was shared by the country as a whole.Few of those involved directly are still alive and those who are would have distant memories of what occurred.  It is hard to see how any further investigation of the matter would add anything to what was found at the time.The file is now in the National Archives and is available for anyone who wants to examine the reports and statements of those who were involved at the time.

This panel is not intended to be an exclusive list of contractors available to applicants to employ, but rather to serve as an administrative mechanism to assist applicants.Issues regarding the availability of contractors will be examined further in the context of the independent evaluation of the new framework of grant schemes which is to be carried out following the first year of implementation.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	656	Section 10(2)(l) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to include objectives for "the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other education and childcare facilities".  This requirement is restated in my Department's Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities, which was published in June 2007, and which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.Draft planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas were issued by my Department in February 2008 for public consultation and reinforce the need for new development to be phased in line with the availability and provision of essential social and community infrastructure such as schools, amenities and other facilities, and for timely consultation with the Department of Education and Science in relation to new schools needs.  Moreover, the draft guidelines state that:"No substantial residential development should proceed without an assessment of existing schools capacity or the provision of new school facilities in tandem with the development."My Department is also working with the Department of Education and Science and the County and City Managers Association in finalising a new protocol that elaborates on the guidance already provided and sets out procedures for the integration of development planning and schools planning by addressing, inter alia, the following key issues:Roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders;The forecasting of future education demand;The interventions required at various stages of the development plan process;Location and site development standards; andSite transfer and acquisition procedures.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I propose to take Question Nos. 516, 536 and 537 together.The Government has undertaken a broad range of actions as part of a strategic response to enhance the range of housing supports and services available to the disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society, including people with a disability and older people.  These actions range from the introduction of better-targeted financial supports to the development of inter-agency protocols to ensure coordinated service delivery at local level where there is a care dimension in association with meeting housing need.My Department operates a number of dedicated grant schemes designed to assist people with a disability with their accommodation needs.The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability Scheme has replaced the old Disabled Persons Grant Scheme.  The scheme is administered by local authorities, and assists in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the specific needs of people with a disability.  The types of works grant aided under the Scheme are varied and may include the provision of access ramps, grab rails, downstairs toilet facilities, stair-lifts, accessible showers, adaptations to facilitate wheelchair access, extensions etc.People with a disability may also apply for grant aid under the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme.  The Scheme, which is also administered by local authorities, provides grants to cover a basic suite of works to address mobility problems.  The Scheme fast tracks grant aid to people on lower incomes, and the types of works grant aided under the Scheme may include grab-rails, access ramps, level access showers and stair-lifts.These schemes were introduced on 1 November 2007 following a review of the operation of the Disabled Persons Grant Scheme.To ensure the effective coordination of services provided by housing authorities and the Health Service Executive (HSE), my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, has also developed a protocol to govern arrangements for interagency co-operation in service delivery for people with a disability, who have been identified by the HSE under the Assessment of Need process consistent with Section 8 of the Disability Act 2005.  This protocol currently applies in respect of children aged under 5 years and will be rolled out in tandem with the extension of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 to all age groups.  A protocol to govern funding arrangements between the HSE and the Housing Authorities in relation to the provision of funding by the HSE for ongoing support costs, where necessary, for social housing projects provided by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector for people with a disability is currently being finalised.My Department is also responsible for the development of a national housing strategy for people with a disability, as set out in the Government's Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and in line with a commitment under Towards 2016.  Work on this strategy, which will have particular regard to the needs of adults with significant disabilities and people who experience mental health issues, has commenced, under the remit of a National Advisory Group, and will be progressed with a view to completion in 2009.  The range of housing options and related supports available to people with a disability will be examined further in that context.In relation to the specific accommodation needs of older people, these can be directly met through a wide range of available supports including local authority housing and voluntary and cooperative housing.  In addition, a cross-departmental team on sheltered housing, also chaired by my Department, was established last year to develop and oversee policy and to agree, as a priority, local structures and protocols for integrated management and delivery of housing and related care services.  The work of this group will ultimately feed into the new National Positive Ageing Strategy, outlined in the Programme for Government.In addition, the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, also introduced in November 2007, aims to provide targeted support to assist older people in carrying out necessary repairs and improvements to their homes.In the context of Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, my Department continues to keep the matter of financial contribution schemes, whereby private housing is part-exchanged for social rented accommodation appropriate for older people, under review.

All authorities have transferred cases from Rent Supplement to RAS and since the commencement of transfers in September 2005 the pace of delivery has steadily increased.  Local authorities actively source accommodation for people who are receiving Rent Supplement, usually for more than 18 months, and who have a long-term housing need. To date some 12,500 cases nationally have been accommodated, of which 6,473 were housed directly under RAS, and a further 6,048 were accommodated under other social housing options.In assessing accommodation for RAS, local authorities take into account that the quality of the accommodation meets local authority standards and, also, that the accommodation is appropriate to the person's housing needs.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I propose to take Question Nos. 518 and 519 together.Local authorities are required to recover from non-domestic water consumers the costs incurred in the provision of water services to those consumers in accordance with the polluter pays principle and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive.  The requirement for non-domestic consumers to pay for water services supplied applies regardless of the use to which the water is put.  Public water supply schemes provide only treated water to their customers so it would not be practicable or appropriate to attempt to supply a lower quality of water to farm customers.In addition, a sufficient supply of good quality water is essential to dairy farming for example, in view of the potential for impacts on milk quality.  Dairy farmers are a major beneficiary of the significant levels of investment in water services under the National Development Plan which has resulted in improved quality of water from both public and rural group water schemes.I have met farming representatives on two occasions within the past year on a number of issues, including water charges.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	660	Part G of the Building Regulations sets requirements for Hygiene. Among these is the requirement for a suitable installation for the provision of hot and cold water to baths or shower baths, washbasins and sinks in dwellings and to washbasins associated with sanitary conveniences in buildings.  Technical Guidance Document G refers to standards that cover the design, installation, testing and maintenance of services supplying water for use within buildings, as well as specifications for individual products associated with hot water storage and piping.  Where works are carried out in accordance with this guidance, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with the Regulations.Part D of the Building Regulations deals with Materials and Workmanship.  It stipulates that all works are to be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner. It defines proper materials as those materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.  This can be demonstrated by a product bearing CE Marking in accordance with the EU Construction Products Directive; complying with an appropriate harmonised standard; a European Technical approval or a national technical specification; or complying with an appropriate Irish Standard, an Irish Agrement Board Certificate, or an alternative national technical specification of another State which provides an equivalent level of safety and suitability.I understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which is under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, set up an Expert Group to examine the area of heating and plumbing in December 2006.  On foot of this, work has advanced on a Standard Recommendation for Heating and Plumbing, SR50.  This will cover all types of hot water services.  It is also intended that a registration/certification system will be set up for installers of heating and plumbing systems.

Public procurement guidelines recommend that contracting authorities ensure that recently established firms or firms with no previous experience of public contracts are not excluded from the tendering process. Measures have been introduced which make it easier to bid for public contracts. A national public procurement website (www.etenders.gov.ie), where all significant public sector contracts are now advertised, was developed by the Department of Finance in recent years. This central facility is available free of charge.Contracts for goods and services are awarded by my Department either on the basis of the lowest priced tender or the most economic advantageous tender (specifying, in addition to price, various other criteria including running costs, servicing costs, level of after sales service, technical assistance, technical merit, environmental characteristics).

The income eligibility for a single income household increased to €40,000 while in the case of a two-income household, the income limit is based on the formula that 2.5 times the main income plus once the secondary income does not exceed €100,000.  Income thresholds are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure they are meeting the needs of the target groups for which they are intended and in this regard my Department is currently completing such a review.  Any decision, on foot of this review, to increase the various limits will be notified to local authorities in due course.However, persons with incomes greater than the limits mentioned above may be eligible for affordable housing provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 or the Affordable Housing Initiative.  Eligibility for these schemes is determined on the basis that a person's income is insufficient to meet the mortgage repayments on a house suitable to their needs, by virtue of the fact that the mortgage payments on such accommodation would exceed 35% of the person's income after tax and PRSI.

The Tribunal prepared a document purporting to comply with this requirement — the so-called "J2 list".  In July 2007, the Supreme Court found that this document did not record a decision on additional matters that should proceed to public hearings, and that accordingly the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to proceed to such hearings under paragraph J(2).  The substantive content of the document concerned is regarded by the Tribunal as confidential and, apart from the proposed module of public hearings that gave rise to the legal proceedings referred to above, matters specified therein have not been publicly disclosed.A Tribunal of Inquiry is established by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.

A subsidy is available to local authorities to make houses affordable by covering all or part of the cost of the site so that the selling price of the unit is within the income range of the target group.To further assist households with household income below €28,000 in the previous tax year, a mortgage subsidy or, as appropriate, a rental subsidy under the Shared Ownership Scheme is available to these purchasers. This subsidy is paid by my Department to the local authority who advanced the loan and is intended to reduce the monthly outgoings of the purchaser. A mortgage allowance of €11,450 spread over 5 years is also available to assist householders who are tenants or tenant purchasers of local authority houses to become owner-occupiers of other dwellings.  Eligibility was extended to tenants of dwellings provided by approved voluntary housing bodies under the Capital Loan and Subsidy scheme, who return their accommodation to the body, thus making it available for re-letting.Details of this expenditure by my Department is set out in the following table:YearSite SubsidyTotal Rental & Mortgage Subsidy PaidMortgage Allowance Scheme.€m€m€m1998N/A1.711.291999N/A1.581.1420000.511.431.0120013.811.530.82200219.742.101.09200324.232.041.72200414.503.862.28200511.284.032.61200610.533.633.1320079.615.303.34In addition, €24,835,263 and €24,924,737 was allocated in 2006 and in 2007 to the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) to fund the purchase of 502 homes on the private market, for subsequent sale to eligible affordable housing applicants at discounted prices.  For 2008, my Department has set aside €71m for site subsidy and a further programme of affordable housing acquisitions by the AHP, €4.2m for Mortgage and Rental subsidy and €3.8m for Mortgage Allowance.This direct funding by my Department represents only one element of the overall range of supports for the various affordable housing schemes. Significant support under the schemes is provided by way of non-voted capital expenditure. This allows local authorities to purchase the units and also provide mortgage finance, where necessary, by means of borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency.  In addition, investment in affordable housing is also supported through the assignment of State lands for this purpose and through the delivery mechanism under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.

There are statutory provisions, codes of practice and guidelines available to assist local authorities in providing the measures required in the Sectoral Plan. Following the completion of accessibility audits, local authorities are required to draw up implementation plans setting out programmes to give effect to the commitments and objectives contained in the Disability Act and the related Sectoral Plan.Each implementation plan will be published and placed on the authority's website and is required to contain targets and timeframes for carrying out the required works. Priority will be given to local authority buildings and other facilities to which people with disabilities most frequently require access, including footpaths, public amenity areas, information and other services. My Department provides €15 million annually to local authorities to assist them in carrying out actions under the national disability strategy. While information on a national scale is not available, local authorities are required to include the progress they have made in implementing the Sectoral Plan in their annual reports.

Insofar as tax incentives for the provision of student accommodation are concerned, these are a matter for the Department of Finance.With regard to accommodation provided for students in the broader housing market, my Department's role is as part of its overall responsibility for the regulation of the private rental sector.  An accommodation taskforce for students does not come within my Department's remit.  However, following a meeting with student representatives in October 2007, I am proposing, with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, to co-fund a study with that Department on the availability of student accommodation in the Dublin Region. I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board to undertake this study which will commence shortly.A steering group has been established to oversee progress on the study and the first meeting of the group will take place this month.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Education and Science and representatives from both the Union of Students in Ireland and the Private Residential Tenancies Board will participate in the group.

Under the Planning and Development Acts the Minister is specifically precluded from involvement in a matter for which the Board has statutory responsibility.My Department and I hold regular consultations with stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management. Consulting widely, with a range of stakeholders, is designed to ensure that my Department and I have as full as possible an understanding of the issues and concerns of stakeholders and are therefore in a position to address them, where it is possible and appropriate to do so.  Such consultations are also useful to assist me and my Department in keeping up to date on alternative technologies to landfill and to traditional incineration.  In July 2007 I met with an environmental consultant acting on behalf of the proposers of the project.  The purpose of this meeting, and of a separate meeting with my Department, was to outline a form of thermal treatment of waste which differs from conventional municipal waste incineration. There was, of course, no question of these discussions comprehending matters proper to the physical planning or environmental licensing processes from which I, and my Department, are precluded from involvement.The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead. It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of our waste. This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.

Since 1 January 2008, every tonne of greenhouse gas emitted in Ireland has a monetary cost.  For the Kyoto period, the purchase of emission credits from outside the country will be necessary to contribute towards meeting our target.  The more successful Ireland is in changing national attitudes and behaviours towards limiting our emissions, the less will need to be spent on these credits.Overall, the campaign is designed to raise public awareness of climate change, its causes, impacts and implications for Ireland.  It includes a significant advertising element as well as extensive stakeholder engagement to develop specific programmes and initiatives tailored to achieve emission reductions at sectoral level.  My Department will also be working closely with a number of Government Departments and bodies to ensure close collaboration on initiatives in areas such as Sustainable Transport, Biodiversity, Agriculture, Tourism etc and to ensure synergies are achieved.

This permits a specified area to be declared an area of special amenity by reason of:its outstanding natural beauty, orits special recreational value,and having regard to any benefits for nature conservation.  Such an order may state the planning authority's objectives in relation to the preservation or enhancement of the character or special features of the area, including objectives for the prevention or limitation of development in the area.Under section 202(2) where it appears to the Minister that an area should be declared a Special Amenity Area he can direct a planning authority to make a Special Amenity Area Order in respect of the area, and may require that objectives specified in the direction be included by the planning authority in the order.Section 34(2) provides that when making its decision in relation to a planning application, a planning authority must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to a number of matters, including the provisions of any Special Amenity Area Order relating to the area. The development restrictions to be imposed in the case of any special amenity area will therefore depend on the provisions of the particular Special Amenity Area Order.

Ireland's commercial oil distribution system is currently based on sea and road transport and the question of compulsory purchase orders for oil pipelines has not arisen at this point.As part of the Government's commitment to review the security of Ireland's oil supplies, I have commissioned an expert study on Ireland's access to commercial oil supplies. This study will include an examination of distribution systems currently operating and will assess a range of options for future developments including pipeline distribution within Ireland and interconnection with Britain and/or continental Europe, and of pipeline distribution within Ireland.  The recommendations of this study, which will be completed in June, will be used to inform any future policy decisions and regulatory actions that may be required to support continued adequate supplies of commercial oil to the Irish market.

The pilot scheme, for which funding of €5 million is provided in 2008, is designed to encourage owners of older homes to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, primarily through insulation measures.  The ongoing results of the pilot scheme will inform the roll-out of the full scale national scheme envisaged in the Programme for Government which I expect to take place next year.The costs, impacts and effectiveness of the different incentives and delivery models deployed in the pilot scheme will be assessed on an ongoing basis by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and my Department. The costs and benefits of a scheme of the scale envisaged in the Programme for Government will be fully appraised in that context.  Informed by the emerging outcomes of the pilot scheme I will be discussing the funding of a national roll-out of the scheme from 2009 with the Minister for Finance in the Estimates context.Previous studies have shown that the private and societal benefits of investment in energy efficiency improvement measures greatly outweigh the costs.  Preliminary estimates from SEI show that a household participating in the pilot scheme could save up to €500 in energy bills every year as a result of the energy efficiency investments undertaken.  The pilot scheme is expected to result in reduced CO2 emissions of 6,000 tonnes per year, while the full €100 million scheme envisaged in the Programme for Government could be expected to yield CO2 savings of 175,000 tonnes per year.My Department's Warmer Homes Scheme has been in operation for a number of years now and also provides support for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  This scheme is managed by SEI and implemented by 18 community groups.  The scheme specifically targets low income homes.My colleague, John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, introduced a new Housing Aid for Older People Scheme on 1 November 2007, which also provides supports for insulation works.

Accordingly the question of a new form of assessment for such miners is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prelude	685	I announced last month a new micro-generation programme, to be carried out by Sustainable Energy Ireland, which will support a range of research and demonstration activities in renewable and Combined Heat and Power electricity micro-generation. An initial focus of this programme will be to commission analysis on the options for commercial arrangements for small scale generation in Ireland.  This analysis will contribute to informing policy on appropriate mechanisms for payment for exports from small scale renewable electricity generators. The pilot project underpinning the roll-out of the national smart metering programme is also addressing the technological aspects of net metering as part of the various work streams.The CER has also recently issued a decision on micro generation.  This decision is set out in the document CER/07/208, ‘Arrangements for Micro Generation'.  My Department intends rolling out further measures, which have significant long term potential should new generation technologies be built into all new buildings from their construction start.

I would be supportive of any measures which help people cut back on fossil fuel consumption for drying purposes.Reducing excessive and unnecessary domestic electricity consumption is a critical part of energy efficiency strategies.  Where the use of household energy appliances is unavoidable the strong message to consumers is to purchase the most energy efficient models. The energy and emissions saved over the lifetime of the appliance more than justifies any additional purchase cost. My Department's Power of One, the National Energy Efficiency campaign has been promoting this message since its launch in 2006. The campaign will shortly be launching new awareness advertisements in conjunction with in store promotions concerning energy efficient appliances.
