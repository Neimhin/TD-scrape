            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</b> asked the <b>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</b> his plans to introduce a coupled payment for sheep farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy 2014-20; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  [20373/14]</p>

            <p eId="para_2">I wish the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, the best of luck today. God knows what it might bring. This question relates to what he intends to do for sheep farmers. He has made a proposal to include the grassland sheep scheme in the single farm payment scheme. For most farmers, this would mean that the grassland scheme would disappear into the single farm payment scheme by 2019. Many sheep farmers receive far less than €150 per hectare as a single farm payment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The grassland sheep scheme is based on Article 68 of the current EU regulation that governs direct payments in the form of the single farm payment. From 1 January 2015, that regulation will be superseded by EU Regulation 1307/2013. Consequently, there will no longer be a legal basis for the continuation of the grassland sheep scheme in its present form. In developing the shape of the new system of direct payments in Ireland I have been very conscious of the needs of sheep farmers, particularly those who farm on hill and commonage land. In general, sheep farmers hold low value entitlements under the current single farm payment scheme and will benefit significantly from the model of convergence to be applied in Ireland. Those with a low initial unit value will see the value of their entitlements increase over the period of the scheme, which is seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Essentially, we have looked to apply the same approach we applied to the beef sector. In the future we will not have a lump sum of unspent money that we can simply assign to a sheep grassland scheme as we did in the past. For this reason, we are proposing to decouple that payment and add it to a sheep farmer's single farm payment. As a result, in 2015 sheep farmers will get the full value, which is €15 million this year. I have increased that value from €13 million last year to try to maximise the amount of money I can put back directly into the sheep sector. That €15 million is as far as I can go in terms of the availability of unspent moneys. We wanted to maximise that amount of money, decouple the payment and add it to a farmer's single farm payment, as opposed to allowing the €15 million to go back into the general pot. The money will be staying within the sheep sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> I am aware that some sheep farmers have said they would prefer a direct coupled payment. That would involve a great deal of additional bureaucracy in terms of inspections and form-filling, etc. The cleanest approach - it is the easiest approach to understand and implement - simply involves taking a decoupled payment, adding it to a farmer's single farm payment and ensuring the €15 million fund remains in place for sheep farmers. We have not yet finalised this, but we will do so in the coming weeks. I have set out the approach we are tending towards.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> When determining the initial unit value of a farmer's entitlements under the basic payment scheme in 2015, Regulation 1307/2013 gives member states the option to take into account any payment the farmer received in 2014 under Article 68 schemes such as the grassland sheep scheme. Deputies should note that this option is only available where the member state is not applying voluntary coupled support to the sector concerned under the new Common Agricultural Policy. I have decided to apply this provision in Ireland as a means of safeguarding the value of the payments received under the grassland sheep scheme for those farmers concerned. The grassland sheep scheme is the only Article 68 scheme being incorporated into the calculation of entitlements under the new basic payment scheme. If such incorporation did not take place, the value of such payments would simply remain in the national fund and be redistributed generally among all farmers who establish entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The incorporation of the grassland sheep scheme payment into the calculation of a farmer’s initial unit value in 2015 will result in a higher entitlement value for the farmers concerned from the start of the scheme, rather than relying solely on the gradual process of convergence to increase the unit value over the five year period up to 2019. Our analysis confirms that as a result of this provision, the group of farmers who receive the grassland sheep scheme payment will have an immediate financial benefit in 2015 as part of their payment under the basic payment scheme. In the past two years sheep numbers have stabilised. While the breeding flock declined slightly in 2013, a return to growth is expected in 2014. I was pleased to note that Irish sheep throughput had grown for the third consecutive year, reaching 2.61 million head, which represents an increase of 7%. These developments led to sheepmeat production rising by around 3% to stand at just over 55,000 tonnes. The total value of Irish sheepmeat exports is estimated to have increased by over 4% in 2013 to reach €220 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_9">Will the Minister agree that if the €15 million fund is used in the way he has proposed, the vast majority of farmers will see their share of the fund reduced by one fifth every year between now and 2019? Under his proposed arrangement, by 2019 they will be getting no benefit whatsoever from the grassland scheme. I suggest he put the €15 million fund back into the single farm payment scheme and then put €15 million into a coupled payment scheme. He is providing for a coupled payment in the beef sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">Yes, the genomic scheme involves a coupled payment. If my suggestion were adopted, it would ensure the €15 million fund would continue to be available to sheep farmers in the next five years, rather than being reduced by one fifth every year. Does the Minister agree that this is the factual position?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">No, because different sheep farmers are in different situations. Each sheep farmer will be affected differently by the redistribution model, depending on what his or her single farm payment is. Obviously, the lower the payment, the higher the gain from redistribution between now and 2019. The relatively small number of sheep farmers on high payments will lose something as a result of redistribution. The issue is how we maintain supports for sheep farmers next year and the year after. The decoupled payment approach we are proposing will mean that the value to them of the sheep grassland scheme will be maintained in full immediately. We will look at a fair redistribution model after this, in the same way that we decoupled beef payments in the past, as opposed to treating the two separately. It is not true to say we have a coupled payment for beef. We decided not to go for a coupled beef payment under Pillar 1 because everybody else would have had to pay for it. Instead, we found €53 million under Pillar 2 for a beef genomic scheme that would involve farmers having to perform a certain number of tasks in order to get €80 per calved cow. If we were to do something similar in the case of sheep, we would probably be looking at a very small amount of money per ewe. I do not think many farmers would want the hassle of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">We are trying to keep this as simple as we can for everybody.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">It must go down as a classic phrase, "We are trying to look after them next year and the year after." That is exactly what the Minister is doing. As one goes to the next year and the year after that, for the vast majority of sheep farmers and virtually every hill sheep farmer who do not have any choice of enterprise, the payments will totally dissipate into the maw of single farm payments.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">That is not true for all sheep farmers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">It is a fact for virtually all hill sheep farmers because they have very low single farm payments. They will be coming up to the €150 which is there anyway. Therefore, what the Minister is saying is that he will look after them next year and the following year once we get over the election. After that their payment will disappear. On what grounds is the Minister not willing to ensure that the €15 million is retained, not for one year or two but into the forseeable future for the length of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, for sheep farmers throughout the country and particularly for the very vulnerable hill sheep farmers who have no alternative choice of enterprise?</p>

            <p eId="para_17">First, this has nothing to do with an election. That might be Deputy Ó Cuív's mindset but it is not mine. This is about putting in place a new CAP process around a redistribution of single farm payment and incorporating a sheep grassland scheme in the same way as when we decoupled headage payments for beef that became part of a farmer's single farm payment. Farmers got the benefit from that. We are now looking at a redistribution post-decoupling and so it makes sense to apply the same rationale to the sheep sector as we applied to the beef sector in the past, and to maximise the amount of money available to decouple for sheep farmers before we do that, which is what we have done.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">EU milk regulations, introduced in 1984, provide for maximum milk production limits for member states and in turn for farmers delivering milk. Milk produced in excess of the national quota is subject to a levy of 28.6 cent per litre, and this sum is levied on the relevant producers and remitted to the European Commission by the Department. In years in which the national quota is exceeded the calculation of such levies is finalised in the September following the end of the relevant quota year. The EU quota regime is due to terminate on 31 March 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Under EU milk quota regulations and related national statutory instruments, my Department is the competent authority for ensuring compliance with the EU milk quota regime and that milk deliveries from farmers are accurately recorded. Where allegations of non-compliance are made, my Department investigates such matters to ensure that the obligations of all parties under the milk quota regulations are being met in full, that any levies are paid in full, that the systems and procedures underpinning the operation of the regime are robust and to ensure that there are no financial losses to the Exchequer or the European Union arising from any non-compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, an investigation by my Department into alleged irregularities is ongoing. The case is proving to be complex. We are very close to finalising the investigation. Last night I got the first report back from officials in the Department, having pulled together all of the different elements of the investigation which involved a lot of interviews and consideration. We also had to get legal advice from within the Department and that has taken time. We are close to drawing conclusions and when we do I will certainly let the Deputy know what they area.</p>

Will other suppliers suffer the consequences of what has happened?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I share the concern of Deputy Ferris. We are taking the issue very seriously, which is why we have taken our time and undertaken a very thorough investigation. It is true that a number of parties are involved - a school, a large food processing company and a large farmer who was managing farming operations on behalf of the school. It has taken a while to get our head around the issues because of the complexity involved. I assure Deputy Ferris that we are taking the issue very seriously. Under no circumstances will I allow dairy farmers, who should be in a position to avail of a reallocated quota because there is unused quota, to be prevented from doing so due to wrongdoing. We will have a full outcome to the case in the next week or fortnight. We will put matters right in terms of what happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">The Irish Coursing Club, ICC, has been the keeper of for the Irish Greyhound Stud Book since 1923. The stud book is the property of the ICC. Section 26 (2) of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, provides that the ICC is subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry, greyhound racing and coursing. The ICC has built up considerable expertise in this area since 1923. It has established the appropriate structures in terms of personnel, information technology and the procedures required to execute all matters relating to the registration of coursing and racing greyhounds. The ICC is a member of the International Greyhound Stud Registries. The ICC manages the stud book and covers the considerable costs attaching to the operation of the stud book. It is my understanding that the ICC has discharged its function as keeper of the stud book in a satisfactory manner to date. Accordingly, I have no plans to transfer responsibility for the studbook to Bord na gCon.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Deputy will be aware that my Department has commissioned independent consultants to undertake a comprehensive review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon. The review encompasses the policy, governance and regulatory framework and the financial situation of Bord na gCon. The consultants will compile a report, documenting the findings of their review. The report will assess the current situation with regard to Bord na gCon and will make recommendations as to any changes required so as to ensure the industry is best placed to meet the challenges that lie ahead in a very dynamic and challenging environment. I expect to get the report shortly. If there are recommendations along the lines advocated by Deputy O'Sullivan then we will certainly take them on board in the same way as we are looking to implement the results of the Indecon report into the horse racing industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">Greyhounds are kept for two reasons: for racing on the track with a mechanical hare, and for coursing, in which wild hares are captured within an enclosure. The National Parks and Wildlife Service has detailed the extent of the injuries suffered by the hares through mauling and tossing and pinning to the ground and also injuries to the greyhounds. In my view it is incongruous and it does not make sense that people who own greyhounds, regardless of their views on coursing, must pay that registration fee to the coursing club. Coursing is illegal in many other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland and Britain, Australia and New Zealand and most of continental Europe, yet coursing with live hares is carried on in this country, in spite of the fact that so many polls show that much of public opinion is against it. Why should a greyhound owner who is against coursing have to pay fees to the Irish Coursing Club to register and name a greyhound? It is known that Bord na gCon has financial difficulties and that the track industry is in trouble. I hope the review will make a recommendation and, if so, that the Minister will consider it favourably.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">We discussed coursing in the context of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill. I hope the Deputy will attend our animal welfare conference next Friday; I understand she has been invited to attend. If she has not received an invitation, I extend the invitation now.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> We will consider the Indecon report on Bord na gCon and the greyhound industry, and if it makes recommendations in this area, I have an open mind about implementation and change. So far as I am concerned, there is nothing untouchable here. Regulation, inspection and enforcement in the operation of coursing and coursing clubs in recent years has changed and improved considerably. I am aware that a large body of people, including the Deputy, would like to see coursing banned. We had that discussion in the context of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill and we decided to take a different route. If the review makes recommendations for future adjustments and changes in that area, we will consider it.</p>

            <p eId="para_36"> I have two further points. The website of The Gathering highlighted the positive aspects of our country in order to attract people to come here. However, there was no mention of coursing as one of those attractions.</p>

There has been a dramatic increase in the financial commitment in the area of animal welfare since I became Minister in this Department. We are trying to do a lot. I acknowledge the Deputy's genuine concerns and views in this area. I hope she will have an opportunity to contribute at the conference next week, although probably not as a platform speaker, because the only politician there will be me and I am only chairing some of the sessions. There will be an opportunity to raise issues from the floor.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I take the Deputy's point about some issues relating to animal welfare being cross-departmental, but my Department has taken on more responsibility in this area than was the case previously.</p>

The basis for these inspections is governed by EU legislation and there are certain minimum numbers that must be conducted each year.

            <p eId="para_65">I have always said that about 73% or 74% of farmers are totally unaffected by this. There is a cohort of farmers, approximately 20%, who have a minor issue with regard to overclaims of less than 2% or 3% on ineligible land.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">The repayments those farmers must make are very small. The payments they did not get last year as a result of ineligible land are very small. There are also a very small number of farmers - in the low hundreds - who have claimed on over 20% of their land, which requires a 100% penalty. We need to work out a way forward with those farmers. </p>
            <p eId="para_67"> This is public money. There are only two ways to deal with this. Either we try to deal with it accurately ourselves on a parcel-by-parcel, case-by-case and farm-by-farm basis, or the Commission will deal with it by making an estimate. It will multiply that estimate by five, seven or ten and that will be a disallowance or a fine which every farmer will have to pay because it will come out of the agriculture budget. That fine could be up to €160 million, which is the figure we have been quoted. The Deputy knows that and I appeal to him to help us to resolve this issue in as fair a way as possible for farmers so that there is a minimal impact on agriculture as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">I asked the Minister how many would be penalised retrospectively over what I understand can be up to five years. It is very important that we get that figure. Does the Minister have a breakdown of the penalty applied? In other words, 33,000 farmers made some mistake, and to think that these set out to give the wrong data to the Department is outrageous.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">How many of these are on land holdings of less than 20 hectares? Does the proportion of farmers who got caught in this system increase as the farm size decreases? A question I asked the Department previously is what percentage of those who were penalised because they had an error of more than 3%, which means they lose three times the overclaim, had land acreage of less than 20 ha. It is disproportionately hitting the smaller farmer because a much smaller error has a much bigger effect on a small farm.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I am giving the Deputy an answer, so he should listen. This is about public money being drawn down on land that was not eligible. We can see it is not eligible because of the accuracy of maps. The European Commission is insisting on asking for its money back plus penalties. For countries that cannot do that, it is applying very significant fines. I am trying to ensure we minimise the exposure of Irish agriculture as a whole and that we try to treat individual farms as fairly as we can through an appeals system and through giving the benefit of the doubt to farmers when it is reasonable to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I do not have exact figures in terms of individual farm size and the percentages for which the Deputy is asking. I think the Deputy knows I probably do not have that to hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">If any farmer feels he or she is being unfairly treated, there is an appeals system in the Department, which has been successful for farmers in terms of the percentage success rate so far, and there is a further appeals mechanism outside the Department if the farmer feels he or she is not getting fair treatment. That is about as fair as we can be.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">All of us in this House and further afield were very conscious of the weather at the start of this year. Many fishermen, particularly inshore fishermen - the more dependent fishermen - had no income from the middle of December until probably the beginning of April. Will the Minister seek compensation under the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to try to compensate for the loss of earnings for fishermen from mid-January to April as a consequence of the terrible weather during that period?</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_87">I thank the Deputy for this question. I think he knows we have already put quite a considerable budget in place in response to that storm damage, particularly from a construction point of view, within 115 harbours controlled and managed by local authorities. That was a total of approximately €9 million. We are putting a further €14.6 million in place for our own harbours this year. We have also put a pot compensation scheme in place for fishermen who have lost lobster and shrimp pots. To be honest, the response to that scheme, clearly because of some of the restrictions associated with it, is that there have been only 151 applicants, so we are reviewing whether we need to do something further, as I have said previously in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> I am anxious to do something more than we have done for this sector. Next week I will outline a new policy framework for the inshore fishing sector, which should have been done in the past but was not done, and which will for the first time put structures in place to give inshore fishermen a voice in contributing to policy decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> The reason it is hard for me to give the Deputy an exact answer to his question is that we do not have a clear picture as to what the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund will be for Ireland, so it is very hard for me to make commitments on the back of not knowing what the budget will be. Hopefully, we will know that figure by the end of this month, or certainly by the end of June. The European Commission is finalising that.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> We have options to do all sorts of things with that new fisheries fund, but we need to know how much money we have and then we need to work out with the industry how we can best spend it in terms of implementation of the new Common Fisheries Policy and potentially putting a fund together which can support fishermen through difficult periods such as the one we had this winter. I have an open mind on all of that, but until I have a pool of money that I know I can spend, it would be irresponsible of me to commit to spending money I do not have.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I thank the Minister for his reply. In regard to the pot compensation scheme and the very low take-up, with 151 applying for it, much of that is down to the restrictions the Minister mentioned and the fact that people had to produce receipts for pots bought in the past. Many people do not have those receipts and that prevented people from trying to avail of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_92"> I refer to the fisheries fund and the loss of earnings, particularly for share fishermen, who, partially through their own fault, do not have access to any type of social welfare payment, although they can go to the community welfare officer to try to beg for money. However, that is not working out. We need some type of fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_93"> Can the Minister confirm that funding can be applied for retrospectively in order to help fishermen who face awful losses? If they do not get some help, many of them will be out of business as a consequence.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">My understanding is that it is possible to apply retrospectively or to apply for hardship supports retrospectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">We need to do that in the context of a discussion with people in the industry about how best to spend a limited amount of money under a fisheries fund, as it will be called. When I know the budget we have - we are trying hard to increase the fisheries fund for Ireland despite the fact that the overall fisheries fund available to the Commission has reduced - I am hopeful we will see an increase in the amount of money we have to spend. We got a particularly poor deal the last time, giving us approximately €10 million per year to spend on the EU fisheries fund. I am hopeful we could get more than that this time. It would be justifiable. Although it is my understanding that this may be possible, we will have to decide the issue in consultation with stakeholders in the industry once we know how much money we have to spend.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Is there any consultation with the industry about that? The Minister has indicated that he will try to see if it can be applied retrospectively. From speaking to people in the industry, my understanding is it can be done. Will the Minister give a commitment that if it is possible to do it, it will be done?</p>

            <p eId="para_97">No, as we must first know how much money we have and then we must prioritise how to spend it. The industry and stakeholders will be part of the discussion. We should know how much money we have to spend by the middle of the year and we will then put in train a process to decide how we spend it by the end of the year. It would be irresponsible of me to start making commitments before I even know the pool of money. I will certainly give a commitment that we will have serious stakeholder discussions of how the fisheries fund will be spent. That is not unusual, and we have ongoing consultations with the industry every week on how to manage quotas and the fisheries sector generally. This will be an extension of that process. It is difficult to decide a set of priorities unless one knows how much money is there to spend. That is the first decision to be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">One of the major challenges facing the agriculture sector is its age profile. Central Statistics Office, CSO, data indicates that the average age of farmers rose from 50 to 54 between 2000 and 2010. More than half were aged 55 years or older, whereas more than a quarter were aged over 65 years. The number of farmers under 35 years more than halved to less than 6% of farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> There are a number of taxation measures available to help minimise the taxation implications of intergenerational farm transfer. I have ongoing and detailed consultation with the Minister for Finance to ensure the continuing effectiveness these measures, which include stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers, which was extended in budget 2012 for a further three year period until 31 December 2015; agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax, whereby the market value of agricultural property is reduced by 90%; and retirement relief from capital gains tax, CGT, where an individual over 55 years disposes of some or all of his or her agricultural assets, including land, once certain criteria are met. Whereas definitive statistics on the number of farms that have been transferred to younger farmers are not available, a good indication of these is the number of farmers claiming retirement relief from CGT. For the two most recent years for which data are available, there were approximately 740 claimants in 2011, with provisional data for 2012 indicating around 610 claimants.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> We have an ongoing review of all agricultural taxation measures with the Department of Finance, and we are trying to ensure we maintain the value of supports to the agricultural sector into the future while recalibrating it for the challenges we currently face. Over the past 30 years, with every budget there have been new decisions affecting agriculture which add to previous issues. We will examine a more strategic approach to agricultural taxation so as to deal with matters like generational change, challenges from climate change, income supports, land transfers and other key issues to be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">I have ongoing contact with the Minister for Finance to ensure that tax policy continues to reflect the Government’s commitment to agriculture and, in particular, to the objectives of smart, green, growth outlined in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. A review of tax measures in the farming sector, a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Finance, was announced in budget 2014 and is now under way. Among the key policy areas identified for examination in the course of the review are encouraging and attracting young farmers and new entrants to farming and succession and earlier lifetime transfers within families.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> The purpose of the review is to analyse the benefits of the various tax measures to the agriculture sector and the wider economy versus the costs, i.e. value for money to the economy. The overall objective is not to change the level of support to the sector through the tax system but rather to maximise the benefits of the existing level of support and to ensure tax policy aligns with the objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020. There has been a good response to the request for written submissions and the next phase of the public consultation will involve meetings with key stakeholders. The recommendations of the review will be considered in the context of budget 2015 and will influence tax policy in the agriculture sector for a number of years to come.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">I thank the Minister for the reply. When a review takes place in every Department, there is concern about elements being removed. I know the Minister is very much committed to young farmers, and he has stated as much and acted upon it in a number of ways. I am sure this review will ensure the best supports can be made available for young farmers and the transfer of land.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> The Minister is aware of the report from Macra na Feirme on land mobility and succession in Ireland, which lists a number of statistics that have been used by the Minister regarding succession and the lack of identification of successors. The main reasons for lack of farming succession are a lack of children in 29% of cases, no decision on which child to receive a transfer in 24% of cases and family members not being interested in 20% of cases. There has been a major increase in the number of young farmers in our agricultural colleges, so the commitment to taking over farms in the sector is still significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> Another issue that is raised is the potential for relationship breakdown, which is a concern for families in advance of making a decision before a transfer. Is the Minister concerned about land mobility having an impact on Harvest 2020 and the potential for growth in the agricultural sector?</p>

This relates to improving productivity and getting younger farmers who are in many cases more dynamic, better educated, more ambitious and with a better understanding of the complex challenges surrounding food security, climate change, animal welfare and a series of other matters. If we are to plan for a growth period in agriculture, as we must, and if we want to be the leading country in terms of agricultural innovation, as we want to be, we need a new generation of farmer to be part of that story. We are doing much with the Common Agricultural Policy reform process and the use of taxation in budgets to try to achieve that generational change, which is clearly starting to happen anyway. There are now more young people in colleges than have ever been there before, with more university courses around agricultural science than we have seen before. The process is happening but we must encourage it.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> I assure the Deputy that the taxation review, confirmed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is not an effort to save money. It is about redirecting and reshaping a package of taxation to ensure it can respond to modern problems.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">The scheme was launched on 15 October 2012 with a closing date for receipt of applications of 30 November 2012, subsequently extended by me to 7 December 2012. These payments are subject to very stringent EU audit standards, which is to be expected given that these are co-funded schemes. All area-based schemes under the existing rural development programme are subject to EU regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, to be completed before payments can issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">These rigorous procedures, together with on-farm inspections, apply equally to AEOS 3, and are necessary to ensure that applications meet the scheme conditions and cross-compliance requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> Approximately 6,000 farmers were approved into the AEOS 3, with a contract commencement date of 1 May 2013, and under EU rules detailed administrative checks had to be completed before the first payments could issue. I am pleased to say that the prepayment validation checks have now been completed on all AEOS 3 applications. In accordance with those rules payments must issue in two tranches, with a first tranche of 75% of the amount due followed by a second tranche of 25%. Taking AEOS 1, 2 and 3 together, approximately 20,000 farmers are in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> AEOS 3 payments commenced last week and a total of €5.5 million issued to all cases that successfully cleared the administrative checks. Payments will continue over the coming weeks and officials in my Department are working to resolve any outstanding issues with a view to issuing remaining payments as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I have explained why there is a delay. The Deputy has been a Minister and he has a pretty good understanding of how the schemes work. There is an application process after which the applications are validated and a series of checks are required before payments can issue. This is because a significant portion of the payments come through the European Commission. We simply cannot pay when we want to; we must pay when we get approval to do so. We pay as soon as we can, which is why payments are issuing at present. I expect the balancing payment to be made in the latter half of the year but I will come back to the Deputy with firm information.</p>

            <p eId="para_123">Is it reasonable to presume that if the Minister announces the GLAS scheme in December 2014 payment will not issue until mid-2016 and no payments will be made in 2014 or 2015 and the second tranche of these payments would be likely to be made in 2017, and this is for farmers who join on the first day. Will everybody have to join the GLAS scheme on one day or will the application process be the same as it was for the REPS scheme whereby one can join over a period of time until all of the places are filled?</p>

            <p eId="para_124">The Deputy is a great man to try to sow worry into farmers' minds. We will give more detail of the GLAS scheme next week when we have further publication of the details of the rural development programme. When the GLAS scheme is up and running it will spend approximately €250 million or €260 million a year. It is a huge scheme. We will try to get as many farmers into it as early as we can and we will try to get payments out as early as we can. The timelines outlined by the Deputy are not necessarily the case. We want to get the GLAS scheme out there as soon as we can, but we must get approval from the European Commission for our rural development programme first. We hope to submit the rural development programme to the Commission for consideration by mid-summer, hopefully by the end of June, which is why we will publish a close to finalised document next week to seek final submissions and comments. At some stage in the latter part of the year we hope to get approval for it, after which we will move to open the GLAS scheme as soon as we can. We will try to accept as many farmers into it as we can from day one, which means we need to give time for the application process because there is much work involved in the applications. We will try to move from these applications to actual payments for the work the farmers must do for them as soon as possible afterwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">It is a very fair question. We are in the process of finalising Pillars 1 and 2 at present. The more complex element is Pillar 2 with regard to rural development funding, which is approximately €4 billion, 46% of which comes from the Exchequer. We hope to have it finalised so we can send a package for approval by the Commission for Pillars 1 and 2 by the end of June. I believe the deadline required by the Commission is the end of July but I am open to be corrected on this. We would like to get in a bit before this and we should be in a position to do so. The Commission will then go through the procedure of assessing what is quite a complex rural development programme from our perspective. We are already discussing some aspects of the rural development programme with the Commission to ensure the rules allow us to do what we want to do. I suspect its assessment of our rural development programme will take a number of months and this will impact on when we can open big schemes such as GLAS following this approval. I hope it will be by the end of the year so we can get information out to farmers as soon as possible.</p>

Until farmers see the total package there is no way they can make a judgment on whether they think it is fair.

            <p eId="para_183">The Twelve Bens-Maam Turks complex in Connemara is an important habitat that has suffered from overgrazing by sheep. Commonage framework plans had been introduced in 2002, but by 2008 it was clear that further restrictions were required to allow habitat regeneration to occur. The need for a more vigorous conservation effort was underlined by a European Court of Justice ruling in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_184"> One of the steps taken to address the issue was a requirement that all farmers in the complex participate in either the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, or a national scheme operated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. In so far as REPS participants were concerned, it was necessary for the permitted number of grazing animals be adjusted in individual REPS plans. While my Department was not in a position to compensate for additional restrictions being put in place, the National Parks and Wildlife Service agreed to make a top-up payment of €2,000 per annum to REPS farmers for a five year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_185"> Both my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht have worked in partnership on this matter. My Department has fully honoured the five year voluntary REPS contracts completed by farmers in the Twelve Bens-Maam Turks area of Connemara. I further understand that, as of yesterday, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has resolved any final outstanding matter and is in the process of making contact with those directly affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_186"> I recognise Deputy Seán Kyne's input into this matter, for which I thank him. He has been speaking to me about the issue for months and we finally have a resolution, as I hope the farmers concerned will recognise.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">The changes were required in the case of REPS plans, not AEOS plans. That is my understanding.

            <p eId="para_189">When an AEOS plan was submitted, it had to conform with the stocking levels laid down by the Department, but they are now redundant. They were removed at the end of last year. In view of the fact that these stocking limitations no longer apply, is it possible for farmers to submit an amended AEOS plan to increase their stocking numbers? That is the question and if the Minister does not know the answer, he might get somebody to send me the answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">Yes, I will come back to the Deputy on that matter. We will certainly take a very practical approach to it. We are looking at changing commonage framework plans across the country. That process will probably be rolled out in the next 18 months. We cannot do it overnight; we will certainly not instruct farmers overnight. We will work with them in commonage areas to make the appropriate changes. If it has an impact on environmental schemes, we will have to take this into consideration. What farmers are being paid under the AEOS often has nothing to do with the stocking rate. However, if there are issues, we will address them. I will get somebody to come back to the Deputy on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_192">This is a complex issue but one with which we have to deal. The discussion process is under way. We have been talking to farm organisations about the best way to do this. I have made it clear within the Department that we are not simply going to send letters to everybody in commonage areas instructing them that there is a change in the stocking rate on their commonage. As the two Deputies who have asked these questions know, within commonages there is a need for co-operation. Sometimes, however, this co-operation is difficult to obtain because of the personalities involved. Where possible, we will have to make changes in commonages where it is straightforward to do so. However, there will be some commonages where the challenges will take a little more time to overcome. If necessary, we will put a mediator in place to obtain full co-operation with the changes made. If the stocking rate changes, it impacts on everybody farming on a commonage and they have to act collectively. To answer the Deputy's question directly, it will take as long as it takes, but we are not going to rush and force farmers into a situation that is unacceptable to them. I expect the process to be rolled out in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_195">Food labelling to inform consumers of the properties of pre-packaged food is governed by EU rules. The most important labelling rule is that the consumer should not be misled. The Minister for Health has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation. New EU food information regulations have extended the explicit compulsory origin labelling requirements to meats other than beef which already has that provision. The positive news for food producers and consumers in Ireland is that we will be extending next year through the European Union a country of origin requirement in the labelling of other meats, including fresh, chilled or frozen meat of swine, sheep, goats or poultry. Implementing rules were adopted on 13 December 2013 under Regulation 1337/2013 and will be applicable from 1 April 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_196"> The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, or FSAI, has overall responsibility under the aegis of the Minister for Health for the enforcement of food safety and labelling requirements in Ireland. It carries out its remit through service contracts with my Department and other agencies, including the Health Service Executive, or HSE. We have a whole series of inspection roles in factories, food service organisations and on farms. The horsemeat crisis last year was a good example of the effectiveness of our regime when a European fraud problem was exposed in Ireland first where we had the systems to do so. My Department has a presence at practically every level and works on a contractual basis and in partnership with the FSAI in most of those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_197"> It is not a surprise that Ireland has probably the most stringent food safety regulations in the European Union because we export so much of the food we produce. Reputation for us is everything. We must protect the consumer and the reputation of our food industry and we are doing everything we can to ensure we do so as professionally and comprehensively as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_199"> Inspections to ensure compliance with traceability and labelling legislation are carried out by a variety of inspection services provided by these agencies under the aforementioned contracts. In traceability, EU food hygiene regulations stipulate, among other things, that there should be "one up, one down" traceability at each point along the food chain and I am satisfied that food business operators in this country generally meet that standard. The onus of compliance with EU food safety regulations, including traceability requirements, rests in the first instance with food business operators. My Department maintains a permanent presence in approved slaughter plants. Regular visits are made to other Department-approved meat plants. The frequency of these inspections in plants other than slaughter plants, which focus primarily on food safety requirements, is determined by a risk assessment, as required under EU legislation, which is conducted for each plant. My Department has been able to reduce the number of inspections at non-slaughter meat plants, where there is no permanent supervisory presence, by moving to a more robust and rigorous targeted system of official controls, based on the risk assessments mentioned above.</p>
            <p eId="para_200"> Official controls and inspections levels are monitored independently by the EU Food and Veterinary Office and by the FSAI under service contract. Food business operators in Ireland are responsible <i>inter alia</i> for carrying out checks to ensure that their ingredients come from approved plants. In meat plants that operate under the supervision of the Department, official controls are conducted on these checks to verify their effectiveness. An annual audit of products, including imported products, is carried out in all cold stores approved by my Department. Labelling and documentary checks also form part of the routine checks conducted by Department officials. I assure the Deputy that in so far as my Department is concerned, I am fully committed to ensuring that all of the necessary labelling and traceability controls are deployed fully and effectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">Clearly, there was a breakdown last year, but that was because of blatant food fraud as opposed to a breakdown in the systems in place. Across the 28 member states of the European Union, we have comprehensive traceability requirements for the food industry. We have free movement of goods and food in the European Union but we also have a tight, strict system that is common to every country and which sets out the obligations on full traceability. One can have rules but if someone sets out to commit fraud and deliberately mislead, as happened in the case of horsemeat, one needs robust systems to expose it. That is why we have new systems in Ireland for DNA testing in the food industry which we never had before except on a pilot project basis. DNA testing is now carried out as part of the systematic food testing which takes place in Ireland. We will encourage the adoption of that approach in other European countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_203"> When the European Commission negotiates trade agreements with third countries outside the European Union, such as the recent agreement with Canada, a major aspect is a provision that the standards on traceability, safety, animal husbandry, hormones and genetically modified organisms which apply here also apply to producers exporting to the EU. The negotiation and inspection process involved is complex, which is why deals take a great deal of time to get across the line. We have been talking for three years about a potential trade deal with Mercosur countries in South America, but that has still gone nowhere. One of the reasons is the insistence that the standards which apply to food producers here are applied to food being brought into the European Union. There are some exceptions, but that is the principle behind the negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_205">We go above and beyond what the European Union requires in terms of food safety controls as Ireland must be best in class. I am satisfied that the rules and regulations set out by the Commission are being implemented across the European Union. While there will always be mistakes, cases of food fraud and crises, it is our responsibility, as it is the responsibility of other member states, to minimise the likelihood of these events by putting proper inspection systems in place. The inspection systems in Ireland to enforce existing regulations and go beyond that to supervise processing facilities are there to protect the reputation of the Irish food industry. Where appropriate, we go beyond what the European Commission requires of us to ensure that we protect consumers not only in Ireland but in other parts of the world and protect the reputation of our industry which is a hugely valuable part of the Irish economy.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_206">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_207">That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Charles Flanagan for appointment by the Commission, constituted as provided in Section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution, to be a member of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Acting on my advice, the President accepted yesterday the resignation of Deputy Alan Shatter as a member of the Government. Following this, and pursuant to section 4(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1946, I assigned the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Defence to the Department of the Taoiseach. I have now moved that the nomination of Deputy Charles Flanagan be approved. Following his appointment, I intend to assign to him the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I further intend to assign responsibility for the Department of Justice and Equality to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. It is also my intention to reorganise responsibility for the Department of Defence, pending which I am retaining responsibility for the Department on a temporary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> As a vastly experienced member of the House, Deputy Charles Flanagan is eminently qualified to continue the hugely important work of this Government in the area of the welfare and protection of children. Deputy Flanagan has represented the people of Laois-Offaly in the House for 22 years. During this time, he has served with distinction and has held several important responsibilities as Opposition spokesperson, including as Fine Gael spokesperson on children. I commend his name to the House and look forward to his contribution as a member of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> As the State’s first Cabinet-level Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald inherited a system that was failing to adequately protect our young people. In just three years, she has transformed the constitutional, legislative and administrative systems to make the welfare and protection of children the top priority. She has overseen a constitutional referendum on children’s rights, the enactment of the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis, and the creation of the Child and Family Agency. I know she will bring the same energy, commitment and reforming zeal to her new role as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I would like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Alan Shatter for his work as Minister. During his three years as Minister for Justice and Equality, he implemented huge reform right across his areas of responsibility, from the creation of the personal insolvency system to the referendum on a court of appeal and the reform of the legal profession. His work in opposition on Private Members' legislation will also leave a great legacy on the Statute Book. One relatively minor reform that struck a chord with many people was the way in which new Irish citizens are confirmed. When Deputy Shatter took office, he inherited a degrading system in which people had to make their declarations before sittings of the District Court. He personally changed the system to create proper, dignified ceremonies in which our new citizens can be confirmed in a dignified and appropriate setting in the presence of their families. I have met many new citizens who have been deeply moved by these ceremonies and the dignity of the new process. I wish Deputy Shatter and his family well for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> While acutely aware of recent crises that have shaken An Garda Síochána, I acknowledge the successes that An Garda Síochána achieved at a time of financial constraint. The most recent CSO figures show reductions in 11 of the 14 crime categories for which figures are given and an overall reduction in crime of 6.6%. Burglaries continue to fall, down 7.2% on 2012, building on earlier reductions and providing definitive evidence that the Garda operations to confront gangs involved in this type of crime are succeeding. A new Garda roster and working time agreement was developed, agreed and implemented by the Garda Síochána and results in more gardaí being on duty during periods of greater policing demand. The Government has agreed the commencement of a Garda recruitment campaign as well as a substantial investment in Garda vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Restoring confidence and integrity to the Irish justice system now becomes the number one priority for the new Minister. As Head of Government, I want transparency and accountability in our public service. It goes to the heart of what we all seek to achieve here in the House in representing the Irish people on a daily basis. In pursing this aim, the Government is committed to the establishment of an independent Garda authority. It is hoped that the new Minister will seek written submissions from the public on the structure and remit of the proposed Garda authority by the end of May and, following receipt of these submissions, to organise hearings before the summer break. In addition, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality will commence hearings next Wednesday on its review of the legislation with regard to the oversight of An Garda Síochána under the 2005 Act. The Government looks forward to receiving its report. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> We can never lose sight of this Government’s top priority. I was again given a reminder of that mission when I visited Collinstown Community College in Clondalkin this morning. I had the opportunity to meet recent school leavers and those soon to take their first steps into the world of work. Since becoming young adults, they have never known an Ireland where jobs were plentiful, where people planned for the future with confidence and hope, and where their friends did not automatically look to foreign horizons for new opportunities. Three years ago, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, the country was lacking hope, subject to an international bailout from the EU and the IMF and with an unemployment rate soaring to unprecedented highs. In the face of crisis, the Irish people gave Fine Gael and the Labour Party a strong mandate to fix our public finances and get the country working again. In the three years since, we have steadfastly implemented our plan for recovery based on jobs, stability and growth. Last December, the hard work, patience and resilience of the Irish people was recognised as the country successfully exited the EU-IMF bailout programme. It was an important milestone for our recovery and enhanced our international reputation. Along the way, the Government successfully renegotiated key parts of the EU-IMF agreement. We removed the millstone of the promissory notes from the necks of the Irish people and consigned the toxic Anglo Irish Bank to history. We renegotiated the interest rate and loan terms of our programme loans, saving the taxpayer billions, reversed the reduction in the minimum wage and prevented increases in income tax to help working families. In the three years before we took office, the record of Fianna Fáil was the destruction of 1,700 jobs per week. </p>

          <p eId="para_216">Today, the private sector is creating more than 1,200 new jobs every week. Each job created is another small step on Ireland’s road to recovery. I fully realise the challenge that lies ahead. There are still too many people out of work and too few opportunities for our young people to give vent to their creativity and to progress. That is why this Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party fully intend to see out our mandate, to get our country working again, to bring our national finances under control and to rebuild our economy based on jobs, stability and growth. We have a plan and it is working. All members of the Government are committed to our unifying goal of a working Ireland. I formally commend the name of Deputy Charles Flanagan for approval by the House to be a member of the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">On behalf of the Labour Party, it is my pleasure to support the nomination of Deputy Charles Flanagan as a member of Government and the appointment of Deputy Fitzgerald as Minister for Justice and Equality. Before doing so, I briefly want to speak about Deputy Shatter’s record as a Member of this House for almost 30 years and as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence for the past three years. As one of the few Members of this House to have been elected prior to 1981, I have had the first-hand opportunity to witness his commitment to public service and his tenacity and determination to change Ireland for the better. As others have noted, Deputy Shatter published more legislation during his time on the Opposition benches than any other Deputy. Among other areas, this legislative record included considerable work on the liberalisation of family law in Ireland, an area of work I was delighted to support and that I believe will be long remembered. As Minister, he has continued his work in this area, and the children and family relationships Bill is an important item of legislation currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny. It will now fall to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to ensure the enactment of that legislation, and I look forward to working closely with her in securing the best interests of all children in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> When this Government took office, we were faced by a number of crises in our society. Issues around bank debt and regaining our economic sovereignty have deservedly received enormous attention over the past three years but, at an individual level, unsustainable mortgage debt and rising unemployment were the two factors we have constantly had to grapple with. The personal insolvency legislation introduced by Deputy Shatter as Minister is our most significant policy response to the issue of unsustainable personal debt. In the first quarter of this year, more than 500 cases were being processed by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. That represents a lifeline and a chance for more than 500 families to find long-term debt solutions, but the reforms of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, stretch way beyond this. The Legal Services Regulation Bill is a far-reaching item of legislation which will bring long-overdue reforms to the regulation of the legal professions. The establishment of a Court of Appeal in Ireland was also long overdue. Increased powers to support the Garda Síochána in combating white-collar crime, legislation to create the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and mandatory vetting for adults working with children are other notable achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> It seems a cliché at this stage to refer to the long hours and commitment Deputy Shatter showed in his roles as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence, but the fact that it has been said repeatedly does not make it any less true. He was a reforming Minister and his record of reform will stand for many years to come. I look forward to continuing to work with him as a Member of this House to ensure the legislation he initiated can be enacted during the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> As the first dedicated Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald has an equally impressive record over the past three years. I worked very closely with Deputy Fitzgerald during the establishment of her Department. Areas such as school completion programmes and the National Educational Welfare Board were transferred from the Department of Education and Skills to the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I was personally committed to doing that, although the Department had some reservations in regard to losing some territory. This was completed without any diminution in the level of service provided to children on the margins of our society. Clearly, the enactment of a constitutional amendment enshrining the rights of children is one of Deputy Fitzgerald's greatest achievements, but I would like to particularly thank her for her co-operation in beginning to tackle the scourge of bullying in our schools and our communities. We co-hosted a forum on anti-bullying in 2012, and within a year, the action plan on bullying had been published. She was an enormously valuable colleague throughout that process in ensuring progress was made. Her reward for all that work is an entirely new set of challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Having shared a constituency with the Deputy Fitzgerald for over a decade, I know better than many how capable she is. No doubt, she will make a very fine Minister for Justice and Equality. I look forward to working with her, as I did with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, in enacting legislation in a couple of areas that affect schools, particularly legislation around the vetting of adults who work with children and legislation to put an end to any discrimination against gay and lesbian teachers in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Finally, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the Labour Party, to support the nomination of Deputy Charlie Flanagan for appointment by the President as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. As I have already mentioned, this is an area where Deputy Fitzgerald has made enormous progress over the last three years, but there is much work left to be done. Working together, I believe that we can make real and measurable improvements to the quality of early years education in Ireland. The development of an early years strategy this year will be essential to achieving that aim. Meanwhile, the continuing implementation of Children First is essential to ensure all of our citizens enjoy safe and happy childhoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Deputy Flanagan entered this House in 1987, succeeding his father Oliver as a representative for the Laois-Offaly constituency. Deputy Flanagan has served in the recent past as his party’s spokesperson on justice, equality and law reform, and more recently as spokesperson on children. Therefore, he is familiar with many of the policy issues which need to be dealt with when he takes over as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Having served with him for many years in this House, I believe he will discharge his duties with wisdom and maturity. I, and all of my colleagues in the Labour Party, support his nomination, and look forward to working with him in his capacity as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs over the next two years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">For any person, a nomination to serve as a Cabinet Minister is a great personal honour. Deputy Charlie Flanagan has every right to be pleased and proud of this nomination. I and my party congratulate him and also his family and supporters, without whom he would not have reached this moment. I know it is a day they will celebrate and remember with great satisfaction. Likewise, I wish the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, well in her new portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Due to the Government's large majority, the outcome of this debate is not in question. However, it is still important that we address the crisis which has led to this appointment being required. Appointing a new Minister does not by itself deal with what has happened and the unprecedented collapse in public confidence in vital parts of the administration of justice. We are getting a new Minister, but what we need is a new direction. If all we get is a new face carrying on with the same policies and the same approach, further damage will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> It is absurd that we are today discussing the replacement of a Minister for Justice without knowing any specific information about why he resigned. While Deputy Shatter's resignation letter is full of his usual defiance and failure to admit error, clearly Mr. Guerin has made extremely serious points about the mishandling of grave material. Ensuring that this cannot happen again and formally ending the era of dismissing inconvenient evidence and attacking opponents must be at the top of the new Minister's agenda. Yet, we have been denied the opportunity to see the Guerin report before Deputy Shatter's successor is appointed. We have also been denied even the most basic information about how the Taoiseach and former Minister, Deputy Shatter, effectively pushed a Garda Commissioner into resignation. This shows a lot, but does not demonstrate a respect for accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Since the first decades of this State, there has not been such controversy concerning the interaction of Ministers and the Garda Síochána. Before this can be dealt with, the Government must acknowledge it. Instead of doing this, what we have heard from the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government are assertions that Deputy Shatter did a great job and everything was fine even though he chose to resign. In recent years, the Department of Justice has been run with no accountability, an intolerance for questions, unnecessary conflict and a refusal to respect the views of others. Some important legislation has emerged, but it is absolutely untrue that the administration of justice has been radically reformed. In fact key elements of it have been undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> We need a Minister who will rebuild the shattered relationship between Government and the Garda Síochána, who will respect the fact that a garda working in the community makes an impact which can never be matched by touring huge distances in squad cars and who is willing to listen to gardaí and engage with their representative organisations. We need a Minister who is willing to rein back on changes to the legal system which will make it impossible for ordinary people to be represented by the best legal talent and need someone who understands that personal prejudice is not the same thing as evidence when imposing changes no one is asking for and which will deliver no credible benefits but, potentially, make an elite system more elitist. We need a Minister who believes that whistleblowers have a legitimate role to play, because things can go wrong even in the best of systems. The justice system needs a Minister who does not brush aside inconvenient information.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> We agree that we do not need another Minister who combines the roles of Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence. Leaving aside the fact that the near universal practice internationally is to separate these roles, the experiment of joining then has been a complete failure. The Defence Forces believe that they have been significantly reduced in terms of political engagement and the drift in policy terms has been obvious. Morale is very low among the Defence Forces. The Taoiseach must take responsibility for that failed experiment, which was a wrong decision in principle. The Department of Defence was in many ways a model of public sector reform in the past decade and a half. Before the crisis, it had reduced numbers, increased activity and added significantly to Ireland's status as an international force for peace. There is no reason for the two Departments to be joined. It has been bad for defence and the crisis to be addressed in justice is big enough to take up a Minister's full time. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The resignation of Deputy Shatter is something which should have happened a long time ago. He has chosen to leave without admitting any error and in the name of protecting the electoral interests of the Government. He has however pointed out his gratitude to the Taoiseach and colleagues for their constant and steadfast support. This support continued up to lunchtime yesterday, when the Tánaiste said he had full confidence in Deputy Shatter. This steadfast support from Fine Gael and the Labour Party stands in sharp contrast to their approach in regard to former Minister, Deputy Róisín Shortall, who was implementing clear policies on primary care contained in the programme for Government, noble policies which sought to help people in marginalised and disadvantaged communities. She was let go without any defence whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> If Deputy Shatter's resignation is to have any meaning, the Government owes us an explanation for the sheer number of times it chose to defend the indefensible. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their parties were happy to allow behaviour which should never have been acceptable. When information was withheld about the Smithwick inquiry, Fine Gael and Labour had no problem with that. When confidential information was illegally used to make a false allegation of hypocrisy against a Deputy, Fine Gael and Labour said "carry on". When information damaging to another Deputy was leaked and no action was taken, Fine Gael and Labour did not say a word. When a friend and donor was appointed as confidential recipient, Fine Gael and Labour thought there was no problem. When whistleblowers with grave information were marginalised and their concerns dismissed, Fine Gael and Labour tried to ignore it. However, eventually and as late as possible they said that whatever the problem was, it was not political. When I was attacked in the House for having the temerity to challenge what had happened, Fine Gael and Labour cheered along and were happy to vote confidence in this behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Last night the corridors of Leinster House were full of Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies talking about how Deputy Shatter's resignation had somehow brought this chapter to an end. They have decided that their record of supporting the behaviour that led to his resignation is irrelevant. It is not irrelevant; in fact, it is a key factor in this debate. It is not just a new Minister we need, but an understanding that the arrogant and unaccountable way in which this Government as a whole has behaved is what led to the resignation. That is at the heart of the issue. Arrogance and a lack of accountability are the hallmarks of the Government's behaviour towards the Opposition and the very serious issues that are raised in this House. That is fundamentally what led to the Minister's resignation and the need to appoint a new member of the Government. It has to change.</p>

The fundamental behaviour of Government has to change. Above all, there must be respect for other people's opinions, irrespective of who they are, whether whistleblowers or Deputies for whom the Taoiseach has no time. In the case of Independent Members and members of Opposition parties, the Taoiseach has to show the respect which has been sadly lacking in his demeanour and his Government's demeanour for too long. There must be a genuine openness to criticism no matter from what quarter it comes. To date, there has not been that openness to genuine criticism either in the House or outside it. If this does not happen, then nothing at all will have changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">It is probably because of the huge majority it enjoys that there has been an unprecedented level of arrogance on the part of this Government, as seen clearly in the Taoiseach's mishandling of this entire issue. A Government that believes it is always right, does not listen and does not respect the Dáil or the Opposition will inevitably mishandle matters in the way they have been mishandled in this instance. Let us retrace briefly what has happened here. The series of scandals involving the outgoing Ministers began when the two Garda whistleblowers, John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, raised concerns regarding practices within the upper echelons of An Garda Síochána. These two citizens should be commended by this Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">Sergeant Maurice McCabe should have had all his rights as a serving garda restored immediately. Instead, the two whistleblowers were smeared, bullied and dismissed. Indeed, the former Garda Commissioner described their actions as "disgusting". The outgoing Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Commissioner tried to prevent Sergeant McCabe from giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Then there was the GSOC scandal, involving allegations of bugging at the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The Taoiseach's response to that scandal was to seek to put GSOC in the dock by misrepresenting the Garda Síochána Act in such a way as to imply that GSOC was the law breaker. He persisted with that effort for several days, even though I corrected him in this House, before eventually and reluctantly putting the record straight. In the meantime, however, he undermined the independence and integrity of that agency. The Taoiseach told the Dáil there was nothing to see and we should all move on. Instead of establishing a commission of investigation as proposed by Sinn Féin, the Government appointed a retired judge, Mr. Justice John Cooke, to carry out a review, the terms of reference of which were set by the Government. Proposals by Sinn Féin's justice spokesperson, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, were ridiculed on the other side of the House. These were measured, rational propositions to depoliticise these controversies and put a transparent, independent and accountable process in place, all of which was within the authority of the Government and the former Minister. The Government also dismissed our proposals for a Garda authority, an ombudsman with real authority and other protocols based on the Patten experience in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> What is now crystal clear is that the former Minister resigned purely and solely, as he put it himself, so as not to cause further embarrassment for Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the lead-in to the European and local government elections. Those are not my words but the Minister's own. Deputy Shatter did not resign in the interest of the public good or the proper administration of justice and the Garda. He resigned in the interest of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and that is not good enough. Sinn Féin has twice in the past year voted no confidence in the former Minister in this House. Although I am mindful, as I said last night, of the trauma it causes for Deputy Shatter and his family, his resignation is long overdue and should have been sought by the Taoiseach a long time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> This resignation is only the start of what needs to be done. There is a crisis of public confidence in the administration of justice. There also is a crisis in confidence in the Taoiseach's governance in theses matters. He cannot blame Fianna Fáil for this, even though the issues that have arisen go back to that party's tenure. He cannot blame the troika. This happened on the Taoiseach's watch and he followed the Fianna Fáil rule book page by page. There is widespread public support right across this State for the Garda Síochána and the essential service it provides to citizens and communities. It has unique, deep-rooted connections in local communities, connections which the Government and the former Minister have been busily dismantling through the policy of closing local Garda stations. However, there is no getting away from the fact that there is a culture at the top of the Garda of bad administration, poor oversight mechanisms and a lack of accountability and transparency. This dysfunctional culture, which I trace back to partition and the conservative state that was established following the counter-revolution of that time, is evident in all of the institutions of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Sinn Féin wants to see real and far-reaching reform of An Garda Síochána, similar to the changes that we helped to bring about to policing in the North. In saying this, I am not drawing comparisons between the old RUC and An Garda Síochána. Citizens deserve, as a right, a 21st-century, accountable policing service. No police service, no senior police officer and no Garda Commissioner should be solely accountable to any one politician, no matter who he or she is. The Commissioner should be fully accountable to an independent Garda authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The new Minister has a huge responsibility and she must learn the lessons of this disastrous period. Fine Gael and the Labour Party came into office on the promise of a new way of doing business based on transparency, accountability and openness. That is why so many people are so disappointed by what has happened. Clearly, this Government was all about the election campaign and has shown itself to be strong on rhetoric and fine words but short on real substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> In regard to the controversies surrounding the bugging of the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the whistleblowers' revelations, the Government did everything it could to undermine the integrity of the whistleblowers and nothing at all to protect the independence of GSOC. The former Minister, Deputy Shatter, has done some good things in his time in office. However, his disastrous handling of these issues underlines in the starkest terms possible the need in a modern democracy for robust and fully independent police oversight. The investigation into the bugging of GSOC's offices falls far short of what is required. It is not an independent inquiry but merely a review. It has no statutory powers, cannot call witnesses and has no powers to compel individuals to give evidence. The terms of reference were set by the former Minister, who claimed there was no evidence at all that GSOC was the target of a surveillance operation. I have a certain sympathy with Deputy Shatter in this matter, but not with the Government. I can understand the instinct to protect one's Minister - that goes with the territory - but to come in here and reinforce, re-emphasise and reiterate the positions he took up is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The question now is whether there is a real appetite for reform in this Government. I have seen no evidence of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Taoiseach stated yesterday that he did not ask the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, to resign. If, therefore, Deputy Shatter had not resigned for party political reasons, he would still be here and those opposite would all be extolling his virtues as a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> We now come to the nub of the matter. Deputy Shatter has criticised the Guerin report. Yesterday, I invited the Taoiseach - who has read the report - to state that he accepts it. Deputy Shatter is on record as stating that he has not read it in its entirety. The Taoiseach has not yet indicated whether he accepts the Guerin report. We will deal with this tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">He was out defending the former Minister. I reiterate the point that Deputy Shatter was not acting alone. The Taoiseach took charge of matters in March when the Attorney General informed him during a telephone conversation that she did not trust the integrity of her phone and that she needed to speak to him in person in respect of a particular matter. She then alerted the Taoiseach to the issue of the taping of telephone calls in and out of Garda stations and he took charge. It is, therefore, the Taoiseach who should be resigning. Until the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar - as he was entitled to do - praised the actions of the whistleblowers, Labour had remained mute on this matter. It only became active in respect of it in the aftermath of the Minister's remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> We wish to new Ministers well but we will not be supporting the nomination for the position of Minister for Justice and Equality because we do not believe that the Government has learned lessons from the events which led up to the resignation of the former Minister. The problems to which I refer will not be resolved by rearranging the deck chairs. At the core of all of that which we are discussing are several injustices. This is not about me, about the Taoiseach or about the former Minister. Rather, it is about those who had grievances which were not dealt with and the investigation into the murder of Madame du Plantier. In that context, I raised with the Taoiseach yesterday the fact that the State is still spending taxpayers' money to defend a civil action which has led to the resignation of a Minister. What we required is a genuine reforming Government and the quicker we get one the better.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Deputy Fitzgerald has a very difficult job ahead of her, particularly if she tries to do what needs to be done. There are incredible problems within the police force. If she manages to turn the force around and make it one of which we can be proud, it will be a wonderful achievement. Accountability is not something the Garda Síochána does. Transparency is missing and we do not really know how they operate much of the time. We hardly know the rules they work to and we do not know if these have been human rights proofed. We have been shocked by what we have found out in the past 18 months as a result of information brought forward by the whistleblowers, serving members of the Garda and members of the public. There have been issues around drugs where we have serving members actually facilitating the sale of drugs on an ongoing basis. It is very frightening. There is evidence that racial profiling takes place. The dogs in the street know that. When we challenged the former Minister about this matter, we were told the then Garda Commissioner said it did not happen so that was okay for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> I hope the new Minister will look a little deeper. I do not think the Minister's job will be rubber-stamping all that comes her way. She needs to challenge everything she hears and take an entire new look at how everything is done - covert surveillance and the use of informants off the books. The challenges she faces are just so big. Professor Dermot Walsh and whistleblowers such as Sergeant Maurice McCabe and John Wilson need to be listened to. The new Garda Commissioner must come from outside the State. An entire new hierarchy is needed in the police force because the hierarchy that is there is contaminated; there are too many problems there. I wish the new Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, well. We will challenge her day and night but with respect at all times.</p>

I do not like to interrupt Members but it is not acceptable to use this House to accuse members of the Garda Síochána of facilitating the sale of drugs.

          <p eId="para_261">We appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's advice. We are very aware of our responsibilities in that regard and anything we say can be fully backed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> This country stands at a crossroads in the context of the future operation of An Garda Síochána. We have been informed that the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was triggered by the Guerin report. We have not seen that report but the Taoiseach has indicated that it is incredibly lengthy. We are aware, however, that the report contains allegations of grave Garda malpractice and failure to investigate serious crimes. The latter led to appalling tragedies for families throughout the State. Those families have still not obtained justice. The report also deals with the horrendous treatment of the man, Sergeant Maurice McCabe, who tried to blow the whistle and shine a spotlight on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> It is ironic that as the Taoiseach announced the departure of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, yesterday, Sergeant McCabe's complaint against senior officers in respect of bullying and intimidation was being heard. Sergeant McCabe continues to be denied access to the PULSE system, which is preventing him from doing his job. There is an irony in that because when Sergeant McCabe originally made the allegations which lie at the heart of the Guerin report more than five years ago, he was dismissed, ridiculed, vilified and transferred out of the station where he worked. The people inside An Garda Síochána who originally investigated those allegations are still there and they occupy positions in the upper echelons of the organisation. This is a serious problem and the idea that An Garda Síochána can be reformed with any of those who currently hold the rank of assistant commissioner or above remaining in place defies logic. Our experience is that allegations similar to those made by Sergeant McCabe have been made elsewhere throughout the country. There are particular areas in which there are major problems with regard to the operations of the Garda. I refer to Limerick, west Cork, Tullamore and so on in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I do not believe that the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, resigned on foot of just the Guerin report. His resignation was the result of a long litany of serious issues being mishandled. Deputy Shatter made consistent efforts to downplay and minimise people's grave concerns and engaged in repeated attempts to denigrate those who tried to raise particular issues. In that context, I refer not just to Members of this House but also to the whistleblowers, GSOC and others. Two commissions of investigation are about to be established. There is potential for a third to come into play as a result of the findings of the Cooke report. The latter is probably the most serious report of all, particularly as it relates to the bugging of GSOC. We must ask whether establishing multiple commissions to investigate various matters represents the way forward. I bear no personal animosity towards the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and I have no preconceived notions with regard to how his successor, Deputy Fitzgerald, is going to operate. This matter does not relate to individuals, rather it is about whether the Fine Gael Party has an appetite to deal with reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Up until now it has not and members backed the former Minister in every failed effort made by him to down-play and minimise. We need a root and branch review of An Garda Síochána for the first time in the history of the State to develop a modern police service, not a police force, that will operate in a transparent and accountable way to deal with those who are still suffering from the crimes of the past and point to a better way for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">The resignation of the Minister for Justice and Equality is an outright condemnation of the top leadership of the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition Government. The Taoiseach; his deputy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamonn Gilmore, and the most senior Ministers stuck to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, like limpets when it was already obvious that he was careering around the place like an out of control Formula 1 driver on speed, isolated in his racing bubble and crashing recklessly through barrier after barrier, leaving many people crumpled on the road behind him. Garda whistleblowers, victims of Garda malpractice and even the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission were trodden on with a contempt that was the epitome of everything that was opposite to justice. However, without exception, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Government and the sheep in the backbench corrals endorsed, underwrote and validated everything the former Minister for Justice and Equality did. Only a few weeks ago the entire cohort of Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies endorsed, underwrote and validated the actions of the former Minister when they trooped into the Chamber to vote for him without even an audible bleat of dissent. This is not just a jaded Government, it is a Government of hypocrites who have betrayed all hope placed in them by many people in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The dishonesty and mendacity go on, especially at the top level of the Government, in another crucial issue that is seizing the people, that of the water tax. The night before last one of the most senior surviving Ministers, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, went on an RTE television news programme and told the people a blatant falsehood to mislead and deceive them when he said water for under 18 year olds would be free. Simply using a Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officially supported organisation-----</p>

They should go to the polls in their droves to make a powerful statement, not by supporting newly converted anti-austerityites, those who have seen the light when they have been knocked off their horses, but by supporting organisations and candidates that have demonstrated, not with cheap words but their actions, some for decades, that they stand by the people, including working people, the poor, the unemployed and pensioners, and act in their interests to achieve a better society and against injustices such as further austerity, the introduction of water taxes, cuts and the devaluation of work and working conditions as opposed to job creation and decent wages.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_388">The Taoiseach announced the resignation of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, yesterday at 4.30 p.m. in the House. The Guerin report will be published tomorrow and should be debated in the House in considerable detail. It is very unfortunate that the Minister for Justice and Equality resigned when the Members of this House had not yet seen the report. It is surprising also that the Tánaiste, even at lunchtime yesterday, defended Deputy Shatter as Minister and confirmed that he had confidence in him. That is against the background of the receipt of the Guerin report by the Taoiseach's office on the previous evening. Apparently the Taoiseach was launching the campaign of the by-election candidate in Dublin West while his staff were digesting the 300-page report. There are reports today that the Taoiseach was in contact with the Attorney General at 6 a.m. yesterday. The then Minister, Deputy Shatter, was contacted and shown the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Despite his actions, the Tánaiste and other Labour Party Ministers have repeatedly defended the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, for the past 18 months, even when his behaviour was highly questionable. I refer to his attitude to the Smithwick inquiry, his attitude to whistleblowers and so on. All of that has made it difficult for us to comprehend the reason the Labour Party in particular was so steadfast in its support for the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, given his approach to many controversial issues, from the bugging of the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to the whistleblowing incident, and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Can the Minister explain to me when the Tánaiste was first told about the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Shatter? When did he receive the Guerin report or when was he informed that the Guerin report had been received? Does he now find it somewhat unacceptable that he was expressing full confidence in the Minister at 2 o'clock yesterday without having any idea that by that stage the Minister was resigning and the Taoiseach had engaged with him on the issue?</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">The Deputy is asking me questions about the Tánaiste's reaction when he was informed or what he knew at a particular time. In many respects all I can tell him is what I know, although it is not necessarily the full story. The Tánaiste was informed mid-afternoon yesterday that the Minister for Justice and Equality and Defence had tendered his resignation. What we understand is that the Taoiseach had invited Deputy Shatter for a discussion. I am quoting what is in the public domain; I am not party to any of this directly. As Deputy Shatter has said, he read a number of chapters in that report and on the basis of what he read he tendered his resignation to the Taoiseach. That is as I understand it. The parliamentary Labour Party was in session when the Taoiseach made the announcement to the Dáil; I think the Deputy was present, so he heard it directly. I came into the Chamber about five minutes after the Taoiseach had started speaking. That is what I understand to be the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">I thank the Minister. The Tánaiste was informed mid-afternoon. Did the Minister speak to the Tánaiste before coming into the House this morning? There is a reasonable expectation that these questions would be asked, because I find it very surprising that the Tánaiste was blindsided on this issue. Can the Minister confirm when the Tánaiste was told that the report had arrived? Was he made aware on the previous evening, Tuesday evening, that the report had arrived? Was the Tánaiste told then that the Guerin report had arrived and that its content was very grave? Obviously, he was not, nor was he told yesterday morning, even though the Attorney General was told at 6 a.m. He willingly expressed total confidence in the Minister at 2 o'clock even though we now know that the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, intended to resign, and it is clear the Taoiseach knew that. I find it extraordinary that the Taoiseach did not bring the Tánaiste into his confidence earlier with regard to the Guerin report and its potential implications for the status of the Minister, and also with regard to the fact that a senior Minister of the Government in the Department of Justice and Equality was about to resign. Does the Minister not find that somewhat extraordinary?</p>

They were in contact with each other on a number of occasions throughout yesterday and, I suspect, earlier today, but the Deputy is asking me questions to which only the Tánaiste can give him a precise answer. I am telling him what I know, which is not necessarily the whole amount, but I do know that there was ongoing discussion and contact between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste from mid-afternoon yesterday. As the Deputy is aware, they were each attending a different function, and then there was the Arbour Hill ceremony, and events moved very quickly.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">Through the Chair, the Deputy asked me a specific question. I understand the resignation was communicated to the Taoiseach some time in the early afternoon after the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, had read chapters 1, 9 and 20 of the report. On that basis, everything else moved very quickly. As to the precise time the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, knew what and when, the Deputy would have to ask him for that information.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">We could get the information from the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, if he were here. I understand the Taoiseach told us earlier that he was in Galway. I find it extraordinary, given this turn of events and the fact that a senior Cabinet Minister has resigned, that the Tánaiste would not be here, but I will come back to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> The Minister took the opportunity earlier to extol the virtues of Deputy Alan Shatter and his ministerial career. If one did not know better, listening to his contribution, one would wonder why Deputy Shatter had felt the need to resign. We know Deputy Shatter resigned yesterday not because he accepted that he had faltered or done anything wrong and not because he - or, it seems, the Taoiseach - accepted the criticisms in the Guerin report, but to save the bacon of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and prevent further damage to them in the upcoming elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Essentially, he made a party political decision. Former Minister, Deputy Shatter, stood and stands aloof, denying any culpability on his part. He does not accept any responsibility for the succession of debacles that have faced the policing and justice system in recent times; the appalling treatment of the whistleblowers; the appalling treatment of GSOC; the mishandling of the bugging controversy in Garda stations and the collapse in Garda morale and public confidence in the administration of justice. Why should he when the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Cabinet and Fine Gael and Labour Party backbenchers have defended his actions in this Dáil and the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> We are told that the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, knew of these events mid-afternoon. He certainly did not know about them at lunch time. Deputy Quinn's colleague, Deputy Bruton, also did not know about these matters early yesterday morning because she was on the airwaves reiterating her confidence in former Minister, Deputy Shatter. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, must feel very exposed at this point, or does he?</p>

Many of the reasons people did what they did, specifically the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, will become clearer when the report is published. As stated by the Taoiseach yesterday in response to a question from the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, there will be a debate on the report, although not necessarily next week. That might be a bit premature. We should first all read the report which comprises 300 pages. When the debate will be held is a matter for discussion by the Whips.

          <p eId="para_427">As a party, Labour was kept in the dark in respect of the Guerin report and the resignation of former Minister, Deputy Shatter, although the Tánaiste is not here to confirm this. Does the Minister, Deputy Quinn, know whether the Government has yet received the Cooke report? Lest I was a little clumsy in terms of the wording used in posing my initial question, I will rephrase it. Does the Minister, Deputy Quinn, now accept that the resolute denial by former Minister, Deputy Shatter, of a catalogue of events, including the treatment of the whistleblowers, the controversy surrounding the bugging of GSOC, the bugging of telephone conversations to and from Garda stations, was the wrong position to take and that it was a bad call on the part of Government and, in particular, the Labour Party to support him? Does the Minister, Deputy Quinn, believe that the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, had no option but to stand down? Should not the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste have made that clear to him?</p>

          <p eId="para_428">This Government moved with extraordinary alacrity to deal with these matters in a united way. On 27 February, it commissioned the Guerin report, in respect of which eight weeks in terms of completion were provided, which timeframe, give or take a few days, has been met. The report will be published tomorrow. Previous Administrations set up public inquiries that lasted for 14 years and cost the taxpayer a fortune and produced results of a different kind. This is an important matter. I know that every Deputy in this House and Senator in the other House shares our concern in this matter. We want to get to the bottom of the various allegations and statements made on the basis of proper inquiries. The Guerin report which will be published tomorrow will, I believe, provide a lot more clarity than I can possibly give today.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I was wondering if the Minister, Deputy Quinn, had said anything positive about former Minister, Deputy Shatter. While in this regard there was not much information around the old Twitter machine tells me that in the past hour the Minister, Deputy Quinn, said that former Minister, Deputy Shatter, was a reforming Minister, whose record will stand for many years to come. How true.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_433">"I'll tell you something Maurice, and this is just personal advice to you, if Shatter thinks you're screwing him, you're finished."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_434">"If Shatter thinks, here's this guy again trying another route trying to put pressure, he'll go after you." </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_435">"He'll go after you."</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Fortunately, Deputy Shatter has resigned as Minister. However, the comments of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, suggest that he thinks he was great and right to do what he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> At this time, Garda Nicky Keogh - that is his name and he is proud of it - from Athlone Garda Station is presenting information to the confidential recipient, Mr. Justice Patrick McMahon. Given the gaping hole that there is in legislation in this country, which means the avenue of the Ombudsman commission is cut off, he has no option but to go to the confidential recipient. He has been left with no choice but to go public because since last week when the man voted by this Government to be Taoiseach laughed at what he brought to me the word at his local Garda station is that he is a whistleblower or, to use a word being used by many people, a snitch. His allegations are serious, including a cover up of an original file which was stolen, with the original incident being removed from the PULSE system; the creation of new statements and appearance of new original information; non-compliance by the Garda with the court order for disclosure and at least one of the accused being threatened by a garda to plead guilty on the day of the court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">His greatest concern with the drugs operation in November 2009 is that there was a systematic and orchestrated effort by high-ranking Garda officers to induce and coerce citizens, in this case citizens with no previous criminal conviction, to buy drugs from drug dealers, putting them in personal danger, and sell the drugs in turn to undercover gardaí without making any profit, thus boosting crime detection figures concerning arrests, charges and convictions. The result of this operation was that these mostly young citizens of the State, who had no previous drug convictions, now have serious drug convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Finally, a further aspect of grave concern regarding the planning of this operation was that the list of persons nominated to be targeted had a notable omission in that a significant and well recognised drug dealer in the area who has long been associated with a senior member of the drugs unit was excluded. My question is simple enough: what will the Government do to reassure the whistleblower that he will not be bullied or have a rat hung on his door? Will the Government encourage members of the public to go to Athlone Garda station this evening? When the man in question goes to work, he should be encouraged and it should be made known to him that he is a hero and not a rat, as the Government seems to suggest such people are.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">The Patten report, which was published many years ago, had approximately 266 recommendations. Approximately 16 of them referred specifically to the nature of the divided society in Northern Ireland and were particular to that part of United kingdom and all the divisions with which we are familiar. The remaining 250 were the best types of recommendations one could possibly have for a Garda authority in this State. My colleague Deputy Brendan Howlin, now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, brought forward a Bill to that effect. It was rejected by the then Fianna Fáil coalition Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> If we had the desired authority — we will have it — many of the issues raised by the Deputy, whose concerns I share, could be addressed through a proper outlet. We would have a proper ombudsman for the Garda Síochána, a proper authority and a proper complaints procedure. The Labour Party and Government are committed to introducing a Garda authority. We are committed to introducing whistleblower legislation. These have been on the Statute Book in a partial way. Before the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, became the leader of the Labour Party, he published whistleblower legislation. It was accepted on Committee Stage but then it disappeared into the bowels of the then Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The concerns the Deputy is expressing about the individual in question, whom I do not know, are concerns we all share, and I thank the Deputy for raising them. When we have finished our work — we will move without delay — we will have established a Garda authority that will build on the practice that has now emerged in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Northern Ireland is a good place to start, and the Patten report is a document on which we can build our own foundations. This, plus legislation that will protect whistleblowers and other kinds of safeguards, will result in what Deputy Daly called a Garda police service, not a police force and all that this implies. I thank Deputy Flanagan for the way in which he articulated his point. I have outlined where we want to go and we will go there. When we debate the published report, rather than speculate on its content, we will move to have the aforementioned provisions put in place so the kinds of events the Deputy is describing today will no longer happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">The Government has been in power for three years but urgency and three years do not really go together. If the former Minister had been a reforming Minister, he would have taken on board Deputy Wallace's policing Bill last July. The reality, however, is that the Government is not taking it seriously. There have been circumstances in this country requiring the introduction of legislation overnight. Examples include the legislation to close headshops because of the Government's concerns over drug use. There are now circumstances where heroin dealing and the Garda Síochána are being connected. Can we have overnight legislation on this? An amendment to the Garda Act 2005 would allow serving members of An Garda Síochána to make a complaint to GSOC. It is suggested that in section 82 of the 2005 Act, " "member of the public" means a person other than the Garda Commissioner and includes serving and former members of An Garda Síochána" be substituted for " "member of the public" means a person other than a member of the Garda Síochána or the Garda Commissioner". This is because the individual in question is taking a grave risk today. He is bringing the information to someone for whom I have no disrespect as she is doing the job she has to do but the information will be brought to the acting Garda Commissioner. That is not ideal. We need to be reassured that we will not have what happened last week, in other words, tittle tattle coming down the line, including in the form of the Garda car that followed the former member of the Garda and the current member. I know the Taoiseach wanted to make a joke out of it and say the gardaí were following me. We need to be assured that when the information goes to the acting Garda Commissioner, it will not filter down the line and scupper what the people to whom I refer are trying to achieve. Nicky Keogh is a hero. I wish I knew more heroes like him. There are plenty of them in the Garda Síochána. He has done them proud today and I hope they will shake his hand rather than tie a knot in a rat's tail and put it on his door.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">It appears from a very quick review of the record that we had this morning the shortest ever debate on the nomination of a Minister. There was once a tradition of having a day-long debate. On the last comparable occasion, three hours were allowed. It is interesting that, on that occasion, the current Taoiseach, who was then in opposition, attacked the time allowed as insufficient and tabled a counter-motion to extend it to seven hours. This reflects a pattern associated with how the Executive is going about its business regarding stage management, presentation, spin and managing events. The Guerin report is to be published tomorrow and, therefore, there will be no opportunity during Leaders' Questions or the Order of Business to deal with it. From what I can see, this is the standard practice of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> I was somewhat alarmed by the comment of the Minister for Education and Skills that the debate on the Guerin report will not necessarily be next week. The Taoiseach was very clear to me yesterday that there would be a debate thereon in the Dáil next week. I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to make it absolutely clear that there will be a debate on it next week and that the Government will not try to attempt to long-finger it beyond the local and European elections. The approach to everything, including water charges, is to bury the matter in an effort to get beyond the next electoral hurdle. Although the Government had hours to read the Guerin report, which led to the resignation of the Minister for Justice and Equality, the former Minister and Taoiseach were able to make up their minds on it very quickly, if we are to believe all the briefings today. At the very least, we will have a weekend to read the report, which is much longer than the former Minister had. According to the headlines in the newspapers, the Taoiseach gave him but three hours. There is no way that the Minister for Education and Skills should try to slip out of committing to a debate next week on the report. It is what my party is seeking. I ask the Minister for Education and Skills to confirm today that Government time will be made available next week to facilitate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">Deputy Martin observed that we have just had the shortest ever debate on the appointment of a new Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">That is a matter for this House. While other people may have wanted to speak, I understand from the Chief Whip there was no request for extra time. The House was informed last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe. We have given extra time in the past and that time has not been filled. There is no difficulty for us, unless we have to meet specific commitments in terms of timetables that were set by the troika in regard to various things we had to have enacted by a certain time.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> With regard to what I have just said, and what the Taoiseach said yesterday, my recollection of it is slightly better than Deputy Martin's. The Taoiseach said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_452">The terms of reference will obviously have to be debated here. The report is 300 pages long and needs to be considered carefully. [The net point is as follows.] It may not be appropriate, given its scale, for it to be debated next week, but that is a matter for agreement between the Whips.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">If Deputy Martin is of the view, and if the Whips for the Sinn Féin Party and the Technical Group are of a similar view, I am sure we can accommodate that, although I do not want to pre-empt-----</p>

          <p eId="para_455">Okay, but we do not normally discuss Whips' business over the floor. I note the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, did not read the entire report, as he said himself, because of its length. If the general view is that we want to have a debate next week and that sufficient time to read the report and digest it has passed, I am sure that matter can be settled by agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">I have two matters. The Minister last took Leaders' Questions on 3 April and, on that occasion, I raised the issue of the Bethany Home with him. He will recall that the previous day, 2 April, a memorial stone had been unveiled to the more than 200 infants and children who died in that mother and baby home in Rathgar. At that point, the Minister committed to contacting the then Minister for Justice and Equality with a view to reviewing that case. I am very disappointed that the promising words he said in April were very promptly rowed back on subsequently by his ministerial colleague. Now that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is <i>in situ</i>, I ask again that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, requests of Government to review this case because it is an ongoing and very deep injustice to the survivors concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> On a second issue, can the Minister advise us on the regulation of lobbying Bill? I understood this legislation was to be published and substantially progressed by the summer yet we have not seen its publication.</p>

That was supposed to have been presented to the Government and to these Houses before Easter.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Second, on the Legal Services Regulation Bill, it is outrageous that we are over three years through that process and we still have not come to Report Stage and Final Stage. When will that be back on Report Stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_461">With regard to the Cooke report, although the Deputy may not have been in the House, as I said earlier, the note I have is that it will be published imminently. The request to former Mr. Justice Cooke to do this work was made on 19 February, so he has it less than three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> In regard to the Legal Services Regulation Bill, this is complex legislation, as the Deputy knows better than I as he was involved in it. The amendments required for Report Stage are being drafted and the intention is to have it as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">Regarding the Minister's earlier remarks about time being available, in regard to the fourth group, if one likes, in the Opposition - the others - this week, on a number of issues, there has been no time available. I think the Minister misled the House, effectively, in that regard. It was a very short debate. I remember many instances when Governments changed and there was a wide-ranging debate over a number of hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> On the Minister's own portfolio, a couple of weeks ago I questioned him in regard to the changes at junior certificate level and whether we will have an opportunity in this House to discuss the matter. As he knows, there is grave disquiet among second level teachers about this. Many observers did not agree with the approach taken at the ASTI conference in particular, but I believe the megaphone and everything else did express a feeling that the Minister simply was not listening to people and that the need for an independent evaluation at around age 14 or 15 is still there. This is an issue which may need debate in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> With regard to the summer works scheme, while I welcome the amount of funding the Minister has provided, some schools have just missed out, for example, an Educate Together school in Kilbarrack in my own constituency. Is it possible there will be further assistance for those schools that have badly needed works and whose buildings have deteriorated?</p>

          <p eId="para_466">On the two earlier matters, the question of time allocation in this House is a matter for the Whips and the House in terms of how it deals with its affairs. I do not have a role in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> With regard to the teacher unions, I would love them to come in to talks and to explore with the Department and myself how we can make progress. I have listened to and am aware of their concerns, and we would like to move a step further, if that is possible. That has been indicated by me to them on a number of occasions and the matter is with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> On the last point concerning the summer works scheme, we got through tranches of this year's summer works scheme because of the money we were able to make available, and quite a large number of schools have been able to benefit from that. If more money becomes available, there will not be another summer works scheme because we do not have the time to process it, so it will be for next year, if that is possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">Earlier, when the Taoiseach spoke to the House and explained his new Cabinet appointments, he indicated he was taking the Department of Defence to himself, albeit on a temporary basis. In so doing, I suppose he was accepting a point we have made here on many occasions, which is that the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality should not, in fact, ever have been combined. Will the Minister indicate when the role of Minister for Defence will be reassigned? The very least the members of the Defence Forces deserve from us is to be assured they are not some sort of afterthought on the part of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce this Bill. One of the objectives of this Government is to bring more openness and transparency into every area of life. One of the areas I am examining is school boards of management. Like many other boards, when one brings these boards under scrutiny, very often many of them work very well but in some cases where they do not work or do not do what they are supposed to do, there are very limited avenues available to appeal a decision of a school board of management. The Ombudsman is the only avenue at the moment for any parent who wishes to do so. I have discovered that 9,000 complaints have been submitted to the Office of the Ombudsman since its inception. Of these, 4,000 were related to schools. Of these 4,000 complaints, 3,000 were not investigated by the Office of the Ombudsman because she had no remit. The aim of this legislation is to broaden the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman so that she can investigate complaints and issues raised by parents and so that it is less subjective on her part regarding what she does and does not investigate.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_493">In page 3, after line 31, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_494">"(2) All assets transferred under this section shall continue to be burdened with the legal protections attached to them through the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and shall not be transferred to any entity where these legal protections are not present.".</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I believe this is the only amendment before us that is in order. The Bill has two sections. One obviously concerns the deal that was done for the Greeks in respect of their debt, the restructuring of it and the role the Central Bank plays in that. Obviously, that is something that we do not object to. Our only objection is that we never got a similar type of deal. It was very disappointing when we heard on Committee Stage that our officials who were negotiating at that time did not even seek such a venture for this State. </p>
          <p eId="para_496"> That being said, the second part of it deals with the loan book of ICS and other matters surrounding that. The amendment I have put forward is straightforward. It is obviously very much in the public interest given the fact we have seen a number of financial institutions in this State sell on their loan books to unregulated entities. We saw that happen last year. The most notable and recent example has been the sale of the IBRC loan book by KPMG to vulture funds. This is something that has exercised not only those who held those loans. We have seen a number of loan holders taking action and holding a sit-in at the KPMG offices last week. It has also exercised the minds of people who may have loans with other financial institutions which could follow suit and sell on their loan books to unregulated entities. People are concerned about being able to access different instruments of the State such as the Ombudsman for Financial Services or the protections of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, despite how limited that code is. That is a real risk and fear that has been acknowledged by the Government given the fact that in the legislative programme the Minister for Finance identified the need to bring in legislation in this area to ensure that any loan book sold in the future would come under these provisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Here we are today looking at legislation that has been well flagged. It is part of the troika agreement and was supposed to have been passed before the end of last year. It was delayed and we are now looking at the final Stages of it here. About €1 billion of loans at ICS will potentially be sold to vulture funds. It is very clear that when these loans are transferred, the intention is that they will be transferred on. The amendment is quite simple. It basically says that all assets transferred under this section shall continue to be burdened with the legal protections attached to them through the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 and shall not be transferred to any entity where these legal protections are not present. I have heard the counter arguments from the Minister at the pre-legislative stage and on Committee Stage. He talks about the fact that it is likely that the loan book will be bought by a regulated entity in the State because it also buys the infrastructure and it is the infrastructure that it is after. However, the potential is still there for this to be sold to a vulture fund and €1 billion in loans could be held by a vulture fund so that there is no recourse to the Ombudsman for Financial Services and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. In addition, we would probably be in the same situation as we were a few weeks ago where verbal commitments would be given by these same vulture funds to say that they would live up to these type of commitments. This is wholly inadequate. Yesterday, the Minister told my colleague, Deputy Stanley, that the legislation to ensure that unregulated entities that buy loan books in the future will be burdened by the provisions that exist at this point in time will not be in place until next year. Accepting this amendment and giving security, comfort and reassurance to those whose loans are with ICS and who are fearful they will be sold to vulture funds in the coming days, weeks or months is necessary, prudent and the right thing to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">I speak in support of Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment. We discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage, at which time I welcomed the Minister's commitment to bring forward the legislation promised by the Government at an earlier date than 2015, the date provided for in the Government's legislative programme. He said it would be much sooner than this and I hope the Government will bring forward the legislation without delay. Governor Honohan recently attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and said he was not happy with the current position of mortgage holders whose mortgages were sold to unregulated entities. He clearly wants this issue to be dealt with and I know that the Central Bank has raised its concerns directly with the Government. In view of the fact that all of the IBRC mortgages are now likely to be sold to unregulated entities, this is an urgent issue. I hope the Minister can update the House on the stage the legislation is at and when we can expect to debate it. The bottom line is that mortgage holders whose mortgages are sold to unregulated third parties, notwithstanding any commitment to voluntarily sign up to the code of conduct, are left exposed and in a vulnerable position, particularly if they get into difficulty with their mortgage. They do not have the statutory backing of the CCMA, which position is unacceptable. The issue must be dealt with, which is why my party is supporting the amendment.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_499">As my position has not changed since Committee Stage, the Deputies will not be surprised to hear that I am not accepting the amendment. As I said on Committee Stage, there are a number of issues with it. First, it would prevent the sale of mortgages to an entity which was in the process of obtaining authorisation from the Central Bank. It could also potentially prevent the sale of these assets permanently in the event that the CCMA was repealed or replaced by the Central Bank, even if equivalent or greater protection applied to a potential purchaser. In addition, it could potentially give rise to legal complexities in any further sale of loan assets by Bank of Ireland by having a containment effect on the broader pool of assets of the bank, making it difficult to identify which assets had been transferred from ICS under the Bill into the broader pool of Bank of Ireland's assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I agree, however, with the objective of the amendment. The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation that will protect mortgage holders and believes the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill is the most effective way to address the issue in a comprehensive manner. The legislation will ensure the protection of the CCMA or any replacement code in the future will continue to apply to mortgages which are sold to unregulated financial service providers. The legislation is being actively progressed and will be brought before the Oireachtas once it has been finalised. As I said in response to Deputy Michael McGrath on Committee Stage, Deputies can take it that the legislation will be ready a lot sooner than the 2015 date listed for publication. It is on the C list of the Government's legislative programme, but I intend to have it included in the A list of legislative proposals for the next Oireachtas session, if it is not possible to publish it before then. </p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The protection of mortgage holders is an important issue and I assure Deputies that I want to give priority to this legislation. The issue, however, does not arise under the legislation which we are discussing which enables transfers to be made to banks. As all banks are regulated financial service providers, they are required to comply with the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears. The amendment proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty would address the matter in an incomplete manner as it refers specifically to the current CCMA. As I have said, it is not appropriate to refer to the specific code in primary legislation as it could necessitate a change to primary legislation were the code to be superseded or repealed. I cannot commend the amendment to the House, as it would not achieve the objective the Deputy is pursuing. Officials in the Department are engaged with the Central Bank and the Attorney General's office to ensure mortgage holders will be protected under the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill. The Government will continue to work with interested parties to achieve the best result for consumers. The sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill will be dedicated legislation capable of addressing the issue in a more considered and complete way. That is my position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">There is a lot in the Minister's contribution on which we do not see eye to eye. The one thing on which we do see eye to eye is that the best way of dealing with the issue is through the legislation that has been promised, that is, the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill. It is also welcome that it is being brought forward and I believe the Minister will see generosity on the part of the Opposition when it is brought before the House. However, I still cannot see why we will have to wait until autumn for its publication. That being said, I take issue with a number of the Minister's points, including on the issue of the CCMA in primary legislation. It should be included in primary legislation. It is hugely important and many thousands of people rely on it. Banks also rely on it in terms of repossession and so forth, as do the courts, even though it does not have legal status in primary legislation. There has never been a debate on it in this House. It is dealt with by officials at Central Bank level. It went out for consultation and most people who were consulted were completely against the changes that were made in the recent code. As legislators, we should have a say on the CCMA and including it in primary legislation might be a starting point in giving it legal clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The second point is that we know that this is a two-step process. The Bill is about ICS loans transferring to a financial institution regulated in the State, but the second step is that they have to be transferred out of that financial institution. That is where the real risk lies, which is why we should be taking a step now, as clumsy as it may be. There was an opportunity for the Minister, his officials and the Attorney General, with all of the resources at their disposal, to fine tune this proposal because this issue was flagged at pre-legislative stage. However, as with IBRC mortgage holders, the Minister is again acting in the interests of major financial institutions instead of mortgage holders. It is only because of pressure from me, Deputy Michael McGrath and others, including many Independent Deputies, that we have seen the fast-tracking of the Bill, if one could even call it that since we will not see it until the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I thank the Minister for his response which is along similar lines to what he said on Committee Stage. It is welcome that the Bill is going to be brought forward, presumably some time this year. I accept that there are complexities involved and that it is not straightforward, but I am sure that if there is the will - I hope there is - to deal with this issue swiftly, it can be done. When the legislation is brought forward, will it be retrospective? Will it deal with mortgages that have already been sold and are held by unregulated third parties? Will such mortgages come under the code once the legislation is passed? It is particularly important that there be such reassurance and that the legislation will not only apply to future sales.</p>

I will bring forward the legislation as a matter of priority and it will have retrospective impact to cover loan books already sold.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Lyons<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_603">I raise a particular matter in relation to the overall housing crisis and Ballymun families who are trying to find accommodation within the Ballymun area. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced a provision whereby regenerated areas could be exempted from the delivery of rent supplement to those who wished to apply in them. In 2008 a circular issued from the Department of Social Protection to the Ballymun office to ensure it would be prevented from allowing rent supplement within the regenerated Ballymun estate. I commend those who introduced the provision at the time, when it was the right decision. Ballymun was undergoing a massive overhaul in the largest urban regeneration project in Europe. It has been largely successful, notwithstanding the bee in my bonnet about the continuing lack of a shopping centre. I agreed with Deputies of the day and commended the endless efforts they made to ensure a ban was imposed on allowing further rent supplement payments within the Ballymun area. The aim was to ensure people would come in to buy private apartments and that there would be a social mix in Ballymun. Whether that aim has been successful is a matter we will allow the people to decide.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> My issue is that in 2014 we have a massive housing crisis nationally, particularly in Dublin and other urban areas. Zooming right down to Ballymun, we find that the rent supplement ban is still in place in Ballymun. I do not know if it is a good idea to remove it, but we must consider the issue. People come to me every week who cannot find a place to live. Some of them would be able to find private accommodation in Ballymun through the payment of rent supplement if the ban was lifted. I emphasise that I am not asserting that the ban should be lifted. I am seeking an in-depth examination to determine whether we need to review it. The fact is that there are empty apartments in Ballymun, while people from the area cannot obtain rent supplement and are forced to move elsewhere. We must find a solution to allow some of the vacant units in Ballymun to be occupied. I do not know exactly how many are vacant, but it is a matter people question. While I do not believe there are as many vacant as people say, we need an innovative solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> I re-emphasise that I am not necessarily saying we should do away with the ban introduced in 2007, but we need a solution to address the needs of people living in Ballymun today. They do not have homes in which to live and are finding it difficult to find homes in their native area. Given that the matter is the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection, I ask the Minister if her officials can investigate alternative solutions through the rent supplement scheme or another payment process to solve the crisis faced by people in Ballymun in trying to find accommodation within their own area. We have people who do not have homes or are finding it hard to find them. We also have empty units in Ballymun. Can we solve the problem for local people?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_238">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_606">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support for eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance, not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 77,000 rent supplement recipients, for whom the Government has provided a sum of €344 million in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides that a payment of rent supplement shall not be payable in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as being an area of regeneration for the purpose of providing for greater social integration. In some ways, much of what the Deputy raises should be addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">The Minister advised in 2008 that, on the advice of Dublin City Council, the Ballymun area merited designation as an area of regeneration for the purposes of section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. Accordingly, with effect from 27 November 2008, rent supplement is not paid in respect of accommodation situated in the Ballymun regeneration area as set out by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. It was supported by the public representatives and the local authority. We are responding to a request from the local authority to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> The reasons behind the provision is to support Government investment in regeneration and to attain a good social mix between private, social, affordable and voluntary housing so that we do not have an area dominated by one kind of housing such as social housing and we get a good mix of people. The people of the area lobbied for the restriction on rent supplement in the Ballymun area and it was introduced with their agreement. The measures provided for in section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration. Specific provision is made to ensure people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment, and people already residing in the area who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future will not have their entitlement restricted. There are currently 180 recipients of rent supplement in the Ballymun area. It is not a total ban.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> The ongoing designation of Ballymun as an area of regeneration is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I am advised that while the physical regeneration element of the Ballymun project will be completed this year, the social regeneration programmes will continue beyond that date. Current considerations regarding tenure mix will continue and, for that reason, we have not proposed to change it. I have been in Ballymun with the Deputy on a number of occasions. If we receive advice from Deputies and the housing unit at Dublin City Council makes representations, we will be prepared to examine the matter in a way that best contributes to the continuing regeneration, given the efforts of people in Ballymun and of the regeneration agency, in ways that are supportive of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response. In case anyone takes me up the wrong way, I am not asking for the rent supplement ban to be removed because that is not the right decision. The regeneration of Ballymun was about trying to create a social mix. We have an anomaly whereby people in Ballymun who cannot find a place to live but who can identify places in Ballymun where they could live, and who qualify for rent supplement, cannot avail of it in the area. We have a problem and we need a solution. I am aware that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has direct responsibility and it is under his instruction that the circular was issued from the Department of Social Protection to support the concept of regeneration. I will work with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection to seek a new solution. Removing the ban on new candidates for rent supplement is not necessarily the best way because we need to keep in mind the social mix in Ballymun to create a good future for the area. Ensuring a good mix of people from all backgrounds was one of the major elements of the social regeneration, which will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> I am willing to work with Dublin City Council, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection to address the issue. We can come up with a solution to ensure local people from the area who are forced out due to current restrictions can find a new way forward. Perhaps some of the legislation being introduced by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing concerning the housing assistance payment scheme can be examined, and I will work with the Minister of State in that regard. I thank the Minister for taking the time to appear in the Chamber and I am delighted to see she is willing to work towards an innovative solution to address the housing needs of people in Ballymun.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">I am interested in the Deputy's comment that local people believe there are empty private investor apartments in Ballymun. It would be helpful to get data on this point to find out how many we are talking about. Some 180 people are in receipt of rent supplement in the Ballymun area. The regeneration project has cost €750 million and it is one of the biggest investments by the State in the regeneration of areas. It is important that any actions taken enhance the regeneration and take account of the huge amount of work that has been done. People such as the Deputy have put their lives and hearts into the new Ballymun we know today.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> The latest figures from 2012 with regard to housing types in Ballymun suggest that 25% of housing in the regeneration area is owner-occupied, 56% is rented from the local authority and 2.5% is rented from a voluntary body. We want to make sure, although it is not the direct responsibility of my Department, that we keep a good mix of privately owned affordable homes and homes rented from the local authority or from housing associations. The critical issue is to establish, through the local authority or websites dealing with property, whether there are many such vacancies available. In terms of rent supplement, we are moving to a new model, the housing assistance payment, administered by the local authorities in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection in the initial stage. A pilot project is under way in Limerick and it may be that some variation will address the issues raised. It would be disappointing to hear of empty apartments at a time when people need them. There are many empty local authority apartments and houses owned by the four Dublin local authorities, and it distresses me when I see them boarded up at a time when people need those houses and apartments. The same is true if that is happening with private investors in Ballymun.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">I know the Minister is aware of this issue because I have been in contact with the shop steward in the Congress Centre and she said contact had been made with him. On 16 April, 42 workers and two supervisors at the Dublin 12 job initiative scheme received termination notices and were quite shocked at the way in which the situation was handled. Very little information is trickling down to workers on why this is happening and to where the situation can move. There were three meetings of the workers and they asked that the representatives, presenting a united front, approach the Minister seeking a new host to employ the 42 workers and two supervisors to keep the work in the Dublin 12 area. It is a question of whether the Minister can assist these workers in finding a host organisation to keep them doing the good work they do in the area. They know there is a sponsor in Canal Job Initiative Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">If that is the case, they would like to hear from the Minister whether she sees the Dublin 12 Congress Centre going into that initiative or whether there is a role for them that will let them remain in the Dublin 12 area to do the work where they have been doing it in the past 12 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> One thing which relates more to the future than to this issue is the shadow employer and their long-term contracts and future pension rights. However, the immediate issue is as I have described it and the workers would welcome a positive response from the Minister today.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_244" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_620">I was advised of this issue some time ago. No more than the Deputy, I was very shocked at how the job initiative workers were advised of this. Deputy Johan Collins, her colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, and others have been involved for a number of weeks in seeking to assist the job initiative workers and to reassure them. There is no threat to their position from the point of view of the Department of Social Protection. The issue relates to the managers of the particular scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> The Department funds the Dublin 12 job initiative scheme, which currently has 44 participants and two team leaders. These participants are placed in various community facilities in the Crumlin, Walkinstown and Drimnagh areas. On 4 April the Dublin 12 Congress Centre, as sponsor, officially informed my Department that it did not want to renew its sponsorship of the job initiative scheme and requested the Department to source an alternative sponsor for the project. My officials are currently in confidential discussions with two organisations which have said they are prepared to sponsor this scheme and I expect these discussions to conclude in the near future. In the meantime, the current sponsors have assured my officials that they will continue to employ all of those involved until such time as a new sponsor is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> This issue has quite a long history. The scheme was originally under the partnership of KWCD, the Kimmage, Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh partnership. When this partnership was dissolved, the Dublin 12 Congress Centre agreed to take over the role of sponsor of the project. The Department expressed appreciation for that co-operation in facilitating the sponsorship of the scheme at the time and again expressed appreciation of the centre on its recent request to withdraw from its sponsorship of the scheme, as it is entitled to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> The Dublin 12 Congress Centre is also the sponsor of a community employment scheme and a jobs club. The three schemes and the supervisory staff are all based in the Dublin 12 Congress Centre building. At the meeting on 6 March with the Department of Social Protection and the sponsoring committee, various issues which have been the subject of ongoing discussion between the Department and the centre were discussed. These issues have been the subject of negotiation following the centre's agreement to take over the sponsorship some time ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> The renewal application for the scheme was received but was subsequently withdrawn. On receipt of confirmation that the sponsors wished to withdraw, the Department assured the Dublin 12 Congress Centre that it would source alternative sponsors. This is something we do with regard to the various CE schemes, of which there are over 1,000, and on which there are a couple of hundred people on the jobs initiative. From time to time a sponsor withdraws, and the normal practice is to seek another sponsor so that the people involved, particularly those on the job initiative, are never left out on a limb. I assure those involved that this has always been the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I thank the Minister for her response which will be welcomed by the workers in this area. They were shocked at what happened - not just the fact that they got termination notices, but the way it was done and the lack of any detailed information. The shop steward and the workers have been trying to get detailed information. The termination notices issued for 14 June have been withdrawn. However, can the Minister confirm that the congress will continue to receive funding after 14 June if another sponsor has not yet been established for these workers? This important question must be answered. Also, does the Minister think the new sponsor organisation will be able to take over the project by that date? How open are the sponsors with whom the Department is having discussions to taking over the project quickly?</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> There are also questions about negotiations with workers on how the new sponsorship will operate. The workers want to maintain their presence in the Dublin 12 area, in Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh, and do not want to be removed from there. When the KWCD partnership was dissolved and went to the Rathmines-Pembroke area, many of the supports in the KWCD area were removed. The Dublin 12 Congress Centre is one of the supports that remained for Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh. What negotiations will take place with the workers and the new host organisation before it takes over the project?</p>

            <p eId="para_627">The renewed application for this scheme was received and subsequently withdrawn. Obviously, the existing sponsor was free to do this. I understand this came as a bit of a surprise to a number of the Deputy's colleagues, particularly people such as Deputy Eric Byrne. The Dublin 12 Congress Centre is carrying out valuable work with its community employment scheme and its jobs club and proposes to continue with that. I hope it does so, because it is helpful in placing people in community employment and in getting people back to work. The jobs clubs are effective and I understand the one in Dublin 12 will continue, but it has requested to withdraw from the job initiative scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_628"> On receipt of confirmation that the sponsor wished to withdraw, the Department assured people it would do its utmost to get alternative sponsors and asked specifically that the two team leaders and the participants be advised that their roles and posts were secure and that their employment would continue under the new sponsorship. This occurred before Easter and those involved have been reassured on this. Deputy Eric Byrne's office was involved in the issue at the time and was given full reassurance on the position. Unfortunately, the Department was not advised of the action to issue protective notice to the team leaders and participants, but we moved to reassure them that their position was secure. Confidential discussions are ongoing on this issue with two potential sponsors and I hope these discussions will conclude as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">RTE's refusal to broadcast Newstalk's advertising asking listeners to move the dial is an abuse of the State broadcaster's dominant position in the broadcasting sector. This restrictive approach to advertising is a direct attack on competition within the broadcasting market. Action must be taken to ensure RTE cannot hinder competition from independent broadcasters and it should accept the offer of revenue from Newstalk and run the advertisement.</p>
            <p eId="para_630"> I express my belief in the principle of public sector broadcasting and my recognition of the good work RTE has done through generations. I believe in the important role of a public service broadcaster to ensure its content is accurate and impartial and without external influence. That is the bedrock of what public service broadcasting should be about. I support this fervently and will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> Having said that, when I see something I consider to be an abuse of a dominant position, I have a duty to raise the issue. There is no doubt that RTE enjoys a very privileged position, receiving approximately €180 million in licence fees from citizens and playing a central role in the nation's artistic, cultural and political life. At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications I supported delegates from RTE in their condemnation of the broadcaster's inability to deal with its budgeting position because of the Government's decision to withdraw upwards of €5 million in licence fee revenue which would normally come from the budget of the Department of Social Protection. I did so on the basis that reducing its funding in this way would make the operation of the public service broadcaster all the more difficult in the light of the significant competition it faced. However, with RTE's special responsibility and special position come serious responsibilities, one of which must be to avoid abusing its substantial power. By refusing advertising revenue from a legitimate business operation and blocking a rival broadcaster from advertising on its stations, RTE has abused that position. It looks like a simple and petty attempt to frustrate a commercial rival. The nonsensical reason given for blocking the advertisement serves only to reinforce that impression. Station bosses say they blocked it because it contained a call to action. My simple understanding of advertising in general is that the entire point of it is to function as a call to action, that is, a call to consumers to act in a certain manner, whether it is purchasing a product or availing of a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has hinted publicly that he shares my analysis. I call him to action by way of asking RTE management to reconsider its position. The broadcaster has worked hard in recent times to rebuild public trust after a series of high profile problems. I have complimented it on the efforts made in that regard and the changes in its management structure which will facilitate the rebuilding of confidence. Unfortunately, however, unforced errors like this clumsy attempt to damage a rival serve only to distract from the station's important work.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2014-05-08T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_633">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte. </p>
            <p eId="para_634"> RTE is an independent national public service broadcaster, the remit and obligations of which are set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. Section 114(1) of the Act states the principal objects and associated powers of RTE, while section 98 provides that it shall be independent in the pursuance of these objects, subject only to the requirements of the Act. As such, the Minister has no function in RTE's general day-to-day matters, including decisions on advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> It is clear that commercial revenue remains a key priority for RTE, to which advertising revenue is central. There has been a considerable decline in advertising revenue for all broadcasters since the economic downturn in 2008 and the advertising market remains challenging for RTE. Of late, however, there have been modest and tentative signs of stabilisation. The Minister is satisfied that RTE is continuing its efforts to exploit all commercial opportunities in pursuance of its statutory objects.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> The contention that RTE refuses to accept advertising from rival broadcasters is materially incorrect. In fact, it has carried advertisements for several rival broadcasters, including Sky, Setanta, Newstalk, TG4 and TV3, in recent times. It has advised departmental officials that it has no objection to continuing to do so, provided the proposed advertisements conform to its own internal guidelines. Notwithstanding the corporation's continuing objective to maximise its advertising revenue, to which I referred, RTE does have internal guidelines which it provides for all advertising copy houses with broadcaster clients in order for an advertisement to be cleared for broadcast. These guidelines state RTE does not accept advertisements where, <i>inter alia</i>, the advertising broadcaster claims superiority over or denigrates another broadcaster, or requests the audience to tune in to another channel. I am advised that these are the only circumstances in which advertisements for other broadcasters may be refused for broadcast by RTE. It would clearly not be in the company's commercial interests to clear for transmission on its own broadcasting services an advertisement which served to denigrate RTE or effectively asked viewers to discontinue using RTE services. If a broadcaster is not satisfied with RTE's decision to refuse to clear an advertisement for broadcast, it may refer the matter to the Competition Authority, the independent statutory body that enforces Irish and European competition law. The Department does not have a function in the oversight of complaints of this nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> On a related matter and by way of update, arising from the five year review of funding of public service broadcasters, the Department has commissioned Indecon to conduct an economic assessment of the advertising market in Ireland to inform the development of a revised regulatory framework. This review which is expected to be completed in the coming months will provide a comprehensive overview of the market, including an analysis of issues around pricing and competition, and for the introduction of a revised system for setting advertising minutes.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">I note the Minister of State's reference to the guidelines RTE circulates generally to advertising houses and the prohibition on advertisements which seek to denigrate another broadcaster or request the audience to tune in to another channel. While I accept that no advertisement should in any way denigrate a competitor's product or service, whatever that might be, I am not so sure there is validity to the rule that states an advertisement cannot request the audience to tune in to another channel. RTE occupies the position it does by virtue of the legislation that gives it its reason to exist and is supported by the taxpayer to that end. It seems fair and reasonable to say any advertisement by any other broadcaster is effectively competing with RTE and requesting, albeit in perhaps more subtle terms, a shifting of the dial or a change to another service provider for whatever period of time. I am not convinced that this element stands up to competition rules generally, but that is for another jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> The Minister of State's considered response seems to be at variance with the comments of the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, when he indicated his view that if he were the person making the decision - I am paraphrasing him - he would have allowed the advertisement to run. Consumers generally can be given credit for their capacity to discern what constitutes a good service. As I said, my understanding of the function of advertising is to show the choice that is available and, in that respect, it does represent a call to action. However, listeners are not so gullible that, having tuned in to another station and not liked what they heard or saw, they would persist with that station. It is incumbent on RTE to ensure it is able to develop and maintain a competitive advantage based on the quality of service it provides, rather than operating in a restrictive capacity towards its audience by restricting other potential broadcasters from accessing the marketplace. I hope the Minister will be in a position to convey his views directly to the board of RTE in a manner which might see a change in attitude towards what is essentially normal competition that does not in any way seek to undermine RTE or the quality of its programming.</p>

            <p eId="para_640">I accept the statement made by the Deputy. If one were to trawl through recordings of RTE radio programmes, one might come across instances where advertisements for shows on sister stations were broadcast. I listen to RTE radio and this practice can sometimes seem contradictory. I also noted the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte. However, the reply I have just read clearly indicates that there are guidelines which apply within RTE in whether it accepts advertisements from other broadcasters. The station has set down its own rules in this matter. We all take the Minister's comments seriously, but it must be noted that he may have been speaking in a personal capacity. I did not hear the comments in question, but I imagine that what the Minister had to say has come to the attention of those in RTE. While it is important that the national broadcaster retain its autonomy, common sense must ultimately apply in this issue.</p>
