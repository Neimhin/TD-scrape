#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2013, councillors and councils were empowered to vary the rate of the property tax by 15% on a plus or minus basis. As the Minister knows, that legislation provides that the Revenue Commissioners must be informed and given notice of this by 30 September of the preceding year. The legislation also states that the regulations must be put in place by the Minister to allow for a period of consultation to be embarked upon with the representatives of the local authorities. It appears those regulations are on the Minister's desk. Will he publish those regulations immediately? Will he allow councils and councillors the authority to live up to their commitments to their electorate to vary the property tax downwards?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Effective from 1 July 2014, local authorities may vary the rate of property tax in their administrative area for the following year by up to 15% of the basic rate of the tax. As Deputy Cowen said, the decision must be taken by resolution of the council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September in order to apply for the following year. There are certain factors that local authorities are legislatively bound to take into account when deciding whether to vary their property tax for a given year. These include expected income and expenditure, accumulated assets and liabilities, and the economic impact in their local area. The decision is not one that can be taken in isolation as it will have a direct impact on the overall level of funding available to local authorities and, therefore, on their ability to discharge their statutory responsibilities. The financial implications of any decision to vary must be considered. The power to vary the rate of local property tax, LPT, has been conferred on local authorities to further increase their autonomy. Elected members are already responsible for finalising the annual budget of the local authority – it is a reserved function for them – and the power to vary LPT will enable them to influence directly the level of local property tax income they have to meet their expenditure requirements in the future. I will make regulations in the coming weeks to set out the process for local authorities who wish to vary their LPT base rates, including the factors they must consider and the type of public consultation they should undertake as part of the process.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for his response. I take it from what he said that there would be no impediment from his office in cases where councils wish to vary the rate downwards for whatever reasons they see fit, based on consultations members have had with the electorate in recent months which culminated in their election. Could the Minister confirm that we will not have a repeat of last year's debacle when, having committed local property tax funding to local authorities, they had it taken from them? Could he confirm that the funding collected this year, or at least 80% of it, which was originally the intention of Government, will be forthcoming to local authorities where it is collected? I seek assurance that where the local property tax revenue exceeds the general purpose grant of the preceding year, no limits would be placed on the local authority in terms of the funds it has collected?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	The Government has indicated its intention to move towards 80% retention from 1 January 2015 and the remaining 20% of the tax will be used to assist weaker authorities in terms of the equalisation of funds. Naturally, the priority for the equalisation would be to support the local authorities with a weaker funding basis. I expect to notify local authorities in the coming weeks of those decisions. A public consultation process will take place from the middle of July for approximately one month and then local authorities will be in a position to make a decision in good time, as they must do in line with the legislation and with their electoral mandate to notify the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September 2014.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I am pleased to hear it is a firm commitment that the funds raised by means of property tax this year will be retained by local authorities and we will not have a repeat of what happened last year in spite of the commitment made. Perhaps the Minister could respond to my question on a situation where a local authority's collection surpasses the grant of the previous year. Is it the case that what is collected locally will remain locally and there will be no restraint on local authorities?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I can confirm to the Deputy that local property tax is a discretionary income that is collected locally and the maximum autonomy will be given to councillors in order to discharge their functions in respect of the income and expenditure, which they can vary up or down as the case may be in terms of the service provision they wish to apply. I expect the new found powers of councillors will be welcomed, even though during the course of the debate on the legislation on local government reform it was said that we were not giving additional powers to local councillors and that we were just getting rid of councils. One can now see the fruits of the type of decisions that will be made in the context of financial autonomy for councillors who must make important decisions about the level of service they wish to see across the board. That will influence the level of property tax they wish to apply in their administrative area.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	This question relates to the need for a social housing building programme in County Laois. There are 1,450 people on the county’s housing waiting list with up to 1,063 alone having put Portlaoise as their first place of choice for a house. On the Laois side of Portarlington, there are 381 people in need of housing which does not include the Offaly side of the town. Will this be addressed as a matter of urgency?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	In February 2014, Laois County Council was allocated €242,186 to complete works on several projects under the social housing construction-acquisition programme. In March, I approved funding of €750,000 in respect of the delivery of six housing units in Laois under the 2014-2015 local authority housing construction programme. In May, I approved funding of €397,620 for Laois in respect of the delivery of four units of accommodation for persons with intellectual and physical disabilities under the 2014-2015 capital assistance scheme, CAS, for the construction and acquisition of housing for people with specific categories of housing need. Earlier this year, I also announced details of a measure with funding of €15 million to bring 952 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses, known as voids, back into productive use. Laois was allocated funding of €73,900 in respect of 13 voids. My Department has, to date, issued approval for 199 units in Laois to be brought into social housing use under the social housing leasing initiative. The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, was established with the dual purpose of eliminating long-term dependence on the supplementary welfare allowance rent supplementation scheme and enhancing the capacity of local authorities to respond to long-term housing need. As of the end of March 2014, Laois has transferred 554 households from rent supplement, 356 being housed directly under RAS and 198 accommodated mainly in standard social housing. Laois has also been allocated €367,259 under the special resolution fund for unfinished housing developments for 2014 in respect of five developments. The completion of these works will help to bring 25 units onstream, some of which will be for social housing use. Future social housing delivery will be guided by a new social housing strategy, preparation of which has commenced and which will be finalised at the end of the third quarter of 2014.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Some of the information she provided is useful but she has sidestepped my main point. What County Laois needs is a substantial social housing programme. Significant land parcels are in the council’s ownership, such as five acres in Portlaoise and two acres in Portarlington. A further 23 acres in Mountrath, Rathdowney, Durrow and Ballinakill are in the ownership of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Limited, the NAMA for local authorities set up several years ago. These could be transferred back to Laois County Council, giving a total of 30 acres of land available for housing. A small fortune is paid out in rent supplement in the county while there is a need for social housing with 1,450 on the waiting list. Will the Minister approve a social housing building programme for the county as it would be a win-win situation in dealing with the housing list and providing employment for the large number of unemployed building workers in the county?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	As I have said many times before, if we had the capital, we would all like a much larger social housing programme. While we have some commenced mainstream social housing construction, we are exploring whether we can introduce more substantial building programmes that would be off the Government’s balance sheet because we are still constrained by certain fiscal requirements which we, unfortunately, cannot get around. In the meantime, wherever else I can get funding, be it through stimulus or other programmes, we will construct as many houses as we possibly can. Many of the 1,450 on the waiting list in County Laois are on rent supplement and will be transferring to the housing assistance payment in the near future when the required legislation is through and the payment is rolled out across the country. Many of those on the housing list are getting support from the State but, obviously, we want to provide as many social housing units as we can. We have fiscal constraints but we are using every possible measure to find funding for social housing. We will continue to explore those avenues.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The housing assistance payment is a name-change for rent supplement which will now be paid out by the local authorities instead of the Department of Social Protection. That rent subsidy is costing a fortune.I am not arguing that people should not get it. People should do so in the short term, but it was not designed to be a long-term measure. If we had a housing programme then building workers could go back to work, the State would receive PAYE, income tax, universal social charge and PRSI and money spent on rent supplement would be saved. The State would receive in VAT 13.5% of the price of all materials used in the construction of houses. Houses can be built cheaply at present. Local authorities would obtain assets from which they can earn rent for years and then sell on. I understand the position with regard to off-balance sheet issues and that money cannot be pulled out of the air, but there are facilities through the European Investment Bank and the strategic investment fund, which was the National Pension Reserve Fund. There is also the option of establishing trusts to draw down money and establish funding through housing bonds. This has been done in other countries, including capitalist Britain, so there should not be an ideological problem for the man from Fine Gael sitting beside the Minister of State. He cannot have a problem with it if the British Tories allow it to happen in England. As the Minister of State and a representative of the Labour Party I ask the Minister of State to move on this issue because there is a crucial problem. If one walks around the streets of Dublin in the evening or early morning one falls over people sleeping in doorways. The same problem does not exist in parts of the country outside the city, but County Laois and other midland counties have a huge problem with housing waiting lists. Will the Minister of State consider this as a matter of urgency and address it? She stated she is exploring it but she needs to do more than that. People are homeless and we need to find solutions.

At present they have much more insecurity with regard to rent support. There is definitely an advantage for people on rent supplement at present who go on to HAP. They will be allowed to go back to work and retain housing support although the rent will be based on income. This is an improvement and removes the poverty trap of people being afraid to go to work because they are in receipt of rent supplement.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	The Minister is aware the Association of Consulting Engineers published an advice note on 15 May about cases of apparent pirate content in concrete blocks provided by block manufacturers. The Minister has been assuring us for a while that with the new regulations everything would be well but clearly everything is not well. How will the Minister address the latest problem?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	The reason I introduced the new regulations is because everything was not well. I acknowledge the proactive approach of the Association of Consulting Engineers in highlighting this matter. It is entirely appropriate that all professional bodies involve themselves in disseminating such relevant information among their membership. Under the construction products regulation, manufacturers are required to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products which are covered by harmonised European standards or European technical assessments. Since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product on the market, to make a declaration of performance and affix the CE mark to each product. The relevant harmonised European standard for concrete blocks is IS EN 771-3:2011 Specification for masonry units - Part 3: Aggregate concrete masonry units (dense and lightweight aggregates). Harmonised European product standards provide the methods and criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics. The harmonised standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of a system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance including third party oversight. The National Standards Authority of Ireland has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European product standards in the form of national annexes or standard recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland. The relevant building control authorities are taking appropriate actions under applicable legislation to deal with this issue and the Department, in conjunction with the building control authorities, will continue to monitor the situation. Testing has been carried out in a number of affected developments which has confirmed the presence of deleterious material in the concrete blocks, including pyrite and sulphate.My Department understands that in each case, the costs of the resolution are being pursued, in the first instance, with the contractors and suppliers. The actions taken thus far by the relevant parties involved suggest the regulatory system is functioning effectively and that an appropriate means of redress is being pursued through those who were responsible for this building failure.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	The Minister has stated the system is working well because the culprits are being chased. While he has told me about all the wonderful European legislation and regulations that are place, we must go back to the same chestnut. If pyrite has arrived in blocks, the threat is dangerous to any block that has additional sulphate and that gets moisture. Many blocks do, such as all the blocks under the ground, as do the blocks in the outer leaf even though they are plastered. The reason there is a cavity is because the outer leaf gets damp. There will be huge problems if this is widespread. The point is that were the system working properly, this would not have happened. Quarries are not regulated well enough and while they are regulated for dust and for movement of trucks in and out, there is no real quality regulation of standards. For example, in the case of quarries quarrying 1,000 tonnes and 20,000 tonnes, respectively, of stone per week, is there a stipulation as to how often they are tested? The big elephant in the room again is that while the Minister has stated there is a facility for third-party checks, the major problem is the local authority lacks the facility, the manpower and the money to be a serious third party that checks to ensure everyone is behaving well.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	While I will come back to the Deputy, I call the Minister.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	That is the major problem across the industry. Moreover, the Minister's new building regulations will flounder unless he reinforces the local authorities with funds.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	That was a very long question.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The issues raised by the Deputy have nothing to do with the new building regulations yet, as they have only been in operation since 1 March. However, standards have been in place for these concrete blocks going back to 1987. The problem is with enforcement and I completely agree with the Deputy that the building authority must do more to enforce the regulations that already are in place. The standards in place, which initially commenced in 1987, were revised in 2003. Consequently, I am conscious that there are people who are not observing what already is in regulation. Moreover, there probably is not sufficient enforcement or visits to sites, as the Deputy advocates, by the local authorities. I intend to take up this matter with the local authorities to ensure they actually engage in more enforcement. An opportunity has arisen in recent years, because of the revised manner in which staff operate in local authorities, particularly in planning sections, for them to have more time to carry out more enforcement works regarding these problems of pyrite and sulphate in concrete blocks. However, there are people in all these cases who have not gone into liquidation or receivership. There are people who certainly have decided they do not intend to observe the regulations and they will be pursued.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Deputy Wallace, in a final supplementary question.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	It was obvious back in 2007, when the first regulation on checking for pyrite in stone was brought in, that the regulation in question was not as onerous as the British standard. I acknowledge this was changed in February 2013, which is welcome but the major problem is that all along, the Construction Industry Federation and not the State appears to determine what is happening. Public building control must be strengthened if these problems are to be addressed in the future. The Minister mentioned that what I am referring to has nothing to do with the new regulations which came in March but the principle is the same. The Minister's system of assigned certifiers will crack up within the next couple of years. He should not ask me how they will deal with the insurance implications arising from trying to stand over absolutely everything without on-site checks. Does the Minister honestly believe the architect will employ someone to be on site continuously to check that things are done right? As I have stated previously, if a load-bearing beam is being used for which a 32 mm steel bar is specified but where no such bar is on site and if the builder substitutes a 16 mm bar instead, how will the architect know what is in it, even though he will be signing off on it?

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	Deputy Wallace is referring to a different regulation than the construction products regulation to which his question referred.That regulation has been in place for years. Deputy Wallace will be very familiar from his previous working life outside the Oireachtas about what can happen if people want to cut corners. We have cut corners in the past on the building side and I inherited some of the problems which I am trying to sort out-----
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	The bigger the builders, the more corners they cut.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	The Deputy had his chance. In this specific case raised by the Deputy, the report from the Institute of Construction Professionals found that the relevant local authority did carry out a site inspection on 7 April 2014 in respect of the manufacture of the solid 100 mm concrete blocks which it was alleged were contaminated with pyrite and sulfates. Following a site inspection and a visit to the quarry or the block manufacturer concerned, the local authority requested detailed information as required under the legislation to establish the precise nature and extent of the problem, including where the blocks had been supplied, the actions taken or being taken by the supplier to deal with the problem as well as the necessary evidence to demonstrate compliance with the harmonised European standard. We have the procedures in place and they are being followed-----
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The procedures are reactive, not proactive.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	We cannot be on every site but I have asked the local authorities to become more proactive about enforcement of regulations for quarries and the suppliers of these raw materials. We have inherited serious problems because of their inertia in the past and because they did not comply with European standard regulations for blocks and requirements under the construction products regulations.

It is a very straightforward question and I am sure the Minister will have a very straightforward answer.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	The overall funding package for the Leader elements of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will be €250 million. While the EU regulations stipulate that a minimum of 5% of the rural development programme is allocated to Leader, Ireland has decided to increase its proportion to 7%. This confirms the Government’s firm commitment to the economic development of rural areas. The €250 million incorporates €15 million for two agrifood measures which will be delivered via Leader. The draft rural development programme will be submitted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, which is the managing authority for the programme, to the European Commission for consideration and approval in the coming weeks. Following this, my Department will conduct a two-stage process to select local development strategies providing the opportunity to develop partnerships with full and comprehensive consultation, thus maintaining the integrity of a community-led local development approach. My Department will issue an open call inviting all entities that meet the eligibility criteria to be considered as local action groups to express an interest in being selected to develop local development strategies for the 2014 to 2020 programme. The eligibility criteria will be drawn up in such a way as to ensure that the best local action groups possible are selected to develop strategies, including conformity with EU requirements in terms of local action group make-up, capacity to undertake the work and financial capacity to deliver the programme. It is intended to select a single strategy in each area and therefore in cases where more than one strategy is submitted, the groups involved will be asked to come together in partnership to jointly prepare and agree a single strategy in order to ensure that the most comprehensive and coherent strategies come forward for consideration and approval by my Department. I expect that the programme will be operational in early 2015. 
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	Based on the Minister's reply, I ask him to confirm that it would appear that the allocation for this new Leader programme will be 33% less than for the current Leader programme. I ask him to confirm that €100 million remains to be spent on the existing Leader programme and that less than €30 million has been spent this year on that programme. Is there a danger of an underspend occurring under the Leader programme for 2007 to 2013? What steps is he taking to ensure that this does not happen, particularly as I understand that the contracts for some of the delivery companies finish at the end of this year?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The current value of the axis 3 and 4 elements of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is €370 million and it will be €250 million for the next programme. In addition, €5 million has been provided for the axis 1 agrifood measure.To date, €205.7 million has been spent on projects, €12 million has been spent on animation and €55.2 million has been spent on administration, giving a total of €273 million. A sum of €97 million remains to be allocated. The overall expenditure to date in 2014 is €29.1 million, which I expect to increase steadily in the coming months.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	The total amount of funding available under the Leader programme is €375 million, which leaves more than €100 million that has not been spent. At the rate at which the funds are being spent, there appears to be a significant risk that the allocation will not be spent in full. Will the Minister outline the steps he proposes to take to ensure it is spent in full? Under the arrangements the Minister introduced for the Leader programme 2014 to 2020, it seems possible that in one area one company could operate the rural social scheme and Tús, a second company could deliver the child care assistance programme, CCAP, and a third company would deliver the Leader programme. Could one have a scenario in which three companies with three separate headquarters deliver three different programmes in one area? The delivery of programmes was rationalised under previous Governments.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I assure the Deputy that the circumstances he describes will not arise. A single strategy will apply in each area and where more than one strategy is submitted, the groups involved will be asked to come together in partnership to agree and prepare jointly a single strategy to ensure the programmes can be delivered in the most cost-effective manner possible. In the event that more than one strategy is submitted, it will be a matter for the evaluation committee to make a determination and recommendation to the Department. On the steps I will take to ensure money is spent, as the Deputy is aware, in 2013 I asked all the local action groups to indicate which projects would proceed and which would not and to reallocate funding. I am considering the possibility of making a similar request in 2014 to ensure all the money in the programme is spent this year. I expect all the local development companies to indicate to me truthfully which projects will proceed and which will not.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	My question seeks to ascertain how many social housing units will be built by the end of 2016 and how many new builds will be delivered through the Part V arrangements. Part V has not been operating properly and the construction industry is lobbying hard to have it eliminated as a means of incentivising builders to restart house building. Is there any truth in the rumour that the Government is considering the possibility of reducing the Part V requirement to 10%?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years will be determined in the course of the annual Estimates process. The social housing strategy, which is to be published in the third quarter of 2014, will inform the upcoming Estimates discussions. The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded construction programmes. However, earlier this year, I signalled a return to modest levels of new social housing construction, with an announcement of 1,000 new housing starts over the 2014 to 2015 period. The Government also recognises the importance of a wider response to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms. In the 2014 Estimates, funding for housing, at more than €587 million, was effectively maintained at 2013 levels. This includes a €50 million capital stimulus to support construction and related programmes, primarily in the housing area, including €30 million to recommence a public housing building programme. As part of the Government’s additional €200 million stimulus package for the construction sector, announced in May 2014, a further €50 million is also being provided for social housing delivery. Through this overall level of funding, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. In March 2014, I announced the approval of 56 social housing construction projects, with an overall value of some €68 million, under the local authority housing construction programme for 2014-2015. This will deliver 449 new units of accommodation for people on the housing waiting list.Some €20 million of the May 2014 stimulus announcement will be made available for further new local authority projects, details of which I intend to announce shortly. Earlier this year I also announced details of a new measure with funding of €15 million which will be invested in bringing 952 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. Some €20 million of the additional May 2014 stimulus will be used to fund the refurbishment of an additional 1,000 vacant units. I also announced details of the allocations to local authorities under my Department's capital assistance scheme. I realise my time is running out and I want to get to Part V. Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 has contributed to increased social integration and more sustainable mixed tenure communities. The review of Part V, which deals with affordable housing and ensuring there is a social housing gain from private development, will be completed shortly. Any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the general scheme of a planning Bill, which is currently in preparation. As the social housing gain under Part V is contingent on the extent of private development taking place, it is not possible at this time to estimate the number of units that will be delivered under Part V.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The main argument coming from the construction sector is that profit margins on houses are too low for the banks to consider lending, and Part V eats further into these profits. I believe that anyone who would buy a site today and build houses on it would still make some money on it. If the banks will not lend, it tells us there is a problem with the banks. The taxpayer bailed the banks out, it kept them on their feet and now they will not lend to builders unless the sector becomes more attractive and there is no risk whatever involved. The same bankers are prepared to go on the financial markets and gamble with funding they garnered from the taxpayer but they are not prepared to lend to build houses. Builders do not build houses to create homes for people. They build them to make money. However, there are other ways. Doing away with Part V would be a terrible mistake. Part V is not only about the provision of social housing. It is primarily about social integration and it functions to tackle the creation of ghettos. It was ridiculous that, between 2002 and 2011, only 5,000 social units and 10,000 affordable units were provided by Part V. I note that in Clancy Barracks, Kennedy Wilson, an international hedge fund, is looking to build a couple of hundred units. It has applied for permission and has signalled it thinks the site is unsuitable for social units. I am sure it thinks so, but the Minister of State should not let it away with it.

All these issues are addressed in Construction 2020. I acknowledge that final decisions have not been made on some elements, including Part V, but I assure Deputy Wallace that I have no intention of caving in to any lobby on Part V. We intend to maintain a Part V. We are looking at whether its format needs to be changed because, as Deputy Wallace correctly stated, it did not deliver. In fact, it delivered a small number of units in comparison with what it was meant to deliver, despite all the construction that was going on during the boom. It needs to be reformed. I want to protect the 10% social housing element of it, but we have not yet finalised our decisions on it. The other 10% relates to affordable housing. There is a general issue of affordability that needs to be addressed and we need to have a conversation around what we mean by affordability. There are issues to be decided in that respect. Certainly, my commitment is that we will get units from Part V. In the past, unfortunately, while money or land was transferred, it did not result in the units for social housing.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	Will the Minister of State give a commitment today that the Government will insist on a minimum of 10% social housing on every site which is given planning permission in the future? That is a must. Apart from providing social housing, it tackles the considerable social problems in the city. If there is a problem and banks will not lend to builders, is there not more of an argument than ever before for the Government to bring in the strategic investment bank it promised in the programme for Government where it can decide what to lend and to whom to lend?We cannot trust the banks to do it and cannot depend on them to supply us with the necessary funding to carry out infrastructural projects. We have saved banks that were useless and broke, and now they will not even function in the interests of the State and the people. If we cannot tell them what to do, we need our own strategic investment bank.  A huge problem remains. I have just read the Kenny report and it is complicated. It is difficult to come up with a system to control the price of development land but it is very much worth doing.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	We must get a measure on it because as long as development land can be sold for telephone numbers we will always have a problem with housing in Ireland.

The Government has not yet made a decision as to what exactly the revised Part V will be. I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am strongly committed to ensuring that the social housing element of that is maintained and that it will deliver units.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	Planning authorities are already empowered to protect the architectural heritage in the interest of proper planning and sustainable development within their respective functional areas, and to prevent its deterioration, loss or damage. This role is reflected in the adoption of suitable policies for protecting the architectural heritage in development plans and giving practical effect to those policies through development control decisions, generally by liaison between planning officers and conservation officers. I am not contemplating further legislation in this area at present. In the present legislative framework, specific provision is made for development plans to include objectives, inter alia, for the protection of structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest; and the preservation of the character of architectural conservation areas. Provision is also made for the designation of architectural conservation areas, in respect of which development plans may include an objective to preserve the character of the place, area, group of structures or townscape. In considering an application for permission for development in regard to land situated in an architectural conservation area, a planning authority, or the board on appeal, must take into account the material effect, if any, that the proposed development would be likely to have on the character of the architectural conservation area.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I am taken aback by the Minister of State's answer. It would appear from her reply that the Minister of State is saying there is sufficient legislation to prevent deterioration and protect these structures. If there was legislation concerning specific planning rules that would be applicable to the area around historic sites, however, we would not be left with the current situation in Moore Street. In that case, the whole area was allowed to become derelict and we saw that continuing over the years. The site then went to a developer who is now in NAMA. Unless the Minister and the Government intervene, come 2016, we will probably have a national monument from Nos. 14 to 17, Moore Street, but it will be surrounded by the current derelict area. Alternatively, if the developer had his way and found the money, or if NAMA provided it, we would have a huge shopping centre that would completely dwarf our national monument there.  The Dutch authorities would not allow something similar at the Anne Frank House. The Polish and German authorities would not allow fast food takeaways beside Auschwitz or Dachau. We are not protecting our national monument by not having these other plans to support the general area around it. There is not sufficient legislation in place to protect it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has the power to comment both on development plans and on specific development proposals. I would have thought that is the area where such provisions should be made and incorporated into the development plan. As the Deputy knows, the development plan is adopted by the local authority but it is subject to guidelines at national level, both from my Department and, in this area, it is subject to comments from the relevant Minister.Structures are in place but a question may arise as to whether they are appropriately implemented. From my Department's point of view, we are satisfied that legislation is in place to deal with these issues.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof is what we see in Moore Street at present. This issue has been pursued with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht ad infinitum. He has done what he says he can do in regard to the national monument at 14-17 Moore Street. Surely the local development plans should also take account of the aesthetics of the surrounding area. There is considerable potential in that area for housing, indigenous small industries along Moore Street and for continuing the street trading tradition. We should do much more with the street by embracing the national monument because otherwise I think we will be a laughing stock come 2016, although it appears that considerable efforts are being made to divert attention from Moore Street to the GPO. Whether we like it or not, Moore Street is where the men and women moved after they left the GPO. They moved along those streets to what is now the national monument and then to the site of the Rotunda for the surrender. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government could play a stronger role with the local development plan in terms of taking aesthetics into account.

Her question did not refer specifically to Moore Street but if there is anything we can do on the matter in respect of our own responsibilities, I will certainly consider it. There are specific guidelines in regard to developments that affect a protected structure or an architectural conservation area. I could state the guidelines for the Deputy but I do not think that will be necessary. If a more general issue arises relating to the development plan for the area in question, I will certainly investigate whether the Department can do anything.

I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on the way she has been dealing with the housing emergency which she inherited at a time that few resources were available. I am anxious that cognisance be taken of the supports available from the Department of Social Protection, which will diminish in time with the increase in social and affordable housing.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 70 and 75 together.  On 14 May 2014, the Government published Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector. Action 1 of the strategy provides that a national framework for housing supply is to be established on a statutory footing with an annual national statement of projected housing supply and demand published every June. I have asked the Housing Agency to take the lead in implementing this action.  The proper management of all State land is critical and, accordingly, both lands that have been transferred to the Housing Agency and local authority held lands suitable for development will be the first sites considered in any future targeted social housing building programme. My Department’s annual housing land availability survey gathers information from local authorities to inform the publication of the amount of zoned residential land in their areas that is currently serviced. It is currently estimated that there is in excess of 25,000 hectares of undeveloped residentially zoned land nationally, which equates to a capacity for over 500,000 new homes based on a national average of 20 units per hectare. This capacity is considered sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years.  In line with the commitments under the Construction 2020 strategy, a housing supply co-ordination task force for Dublin has been established with an immediate focus on addressing supply related issues. Under action 8 of Construction 2020, a social housing strategy is to be published by quarter three of 2014. To assist in the development of the social housing strategy, the Housing Agency has invited submissions by 31 July 2014. This invitation for submissions is available at the following website: http://www.housing.ie/News/Current-News/Invitation-for-Submissions-Preparation-of-a-Social.aspx
. Action 9 of Construction 2020 provides that a review of Part V of the Planning and Development Acts, which, inter alia, deals with affordable housing and social housing gain from private development, will be completed by the end of quarter two of 2014. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will be incorporated into the general scheme of a planning Bill which is currently in preparation. I am acutely conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and of the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres, with growing evidence of increasing rents affecting more vulnerable tenants, such as those in receipt of rent supplement. I have asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to carry out a focused piece of research that will explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector and report to me with policy recommendations in the coming weeks. On 30 April 2014, the Government approved the publication of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which, when enacted, will provide for the introduction of the new housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2014 to be in the region of 6,000 new housing units. The number and method of delivery of social housing units in future years is determined in the course of the annual Estimates process and will be informed by the social housing strategy currently in preparation. It will set out clear objectives for delivery over the next five years.

The projected 6,000 new units per year are welcome but that is approximately 50% of what is required if serious inroads are to be made on local authority waiting lists over the next five to six years. To what extent has the precise number of required social and affordable houses been identified, given that approximately 90,000 people are already on various local authority housing lists? There are at least another 20,000 vulnerable people in private rented accommodation. These people are working but are not in receipt of rent support so they may find themselves in a very challenging position as time moves on. Will the Minister of State identify a precise number of houses to meet the medium-term challenge?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments. The Housing Agency produced some fairly specific figures recently on projected needs over the next number of years. As I stated, work is also being done on what can be done for people in private rented accommodation and particularly the lower end of that sector. We know the number of people are on various schemes and systems, as well as the waiting lists, so we know what are the needs. Our difficulty is funding the supply. I mentioned to Deputy Stanley the various ways in which we want to construct houses for people, and we will have to try to be more imaginative in this respect than we have been in the past as we cannot significantly increase capital budgets for the State because of restrictions. We are using every possible method and we are open to any suggestions as well.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I share the concerns of Deputy Durkan, a Government party Member, who is exasperated and at a loss in trying to find out the exact housing allocations necessary for this problem and the plans for them to be delivered. I also echo the concerns of Deputy Stanley when he spoke about County Laois, and the issue is no different in Offaly and many other counties throughout the country. The problem is even greater in Dublin. Since the Government took office, we have had a 2011 housing strategy and we were told there would be a social dividend from NAMA. We have also had the Construction 2020 plan and a housing Bill to be finished later today which, as somebody noted in last week's debate, contains no houses but rather deals with housing supports. That is instead of addressing housing needs. As I indicated last week, there is a sleight of hand with regard to waiting list figures, with people coming off a list if they get a short-term solution to a long-term problem. The Minister of State has reiterated the big issue of funding time and again.The Minister of State's line Minister has not been successful in sourcing adequate funding to address this problem in a meaningful way. It is not just a problem, it is a total crisis. If funding could be derived from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to fund the establishment of Irish Water and all that is associated with it, surely the Cabinet could make an effort to find funding from a similar source to address this issue, which must be addressed, taken seriously and dealt with. The platitudes can stop. I spoke to housing agencies only this morning, for example, Alone, which works with the elderly in Dublin. It was consulted on a Friday about making a submission on policy and had a weekend in which to write a submission. There will be a housing summit later this week and we have no idea of its format. Maybe the Minister of State will enlighten us about its process.

I am sure the Deputy will have an opportunity to feed into that. The strategic investment bank will be able to lend to builders. We have set it up. I could refer to history although I really do not want to do that but the Deputy raised the issue of funding. He knows very well that the absence of capital investment in housing, not just in the past three years but prior to that, under the Fianna Fáil-led Government, was due to the constrictions on capital which were part of the agreement with the European Commission.

That is why we have directed a significant sum for this year and next year to those, which will bring more than 1,700 units back into use. Then we will start construction. As soon as we can get funding, we will construct more. We could not do it up to now because we were constrained.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I cannot but be moved by the comments from the Opposition given recent history because the whole social housing problem that arises now is due to the failure over a 15 year period to have any proper housing strategy. That is what the present Government inherited. The Minister of State could be forthright, admit that and say it to the public because we will not do anything meaningful about this issue unless and until we devise a system that will deal with it. The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, passed last week, might be used as a vehicle to try to ensure funding is made available, because funding is obviously a problem, for the direct construction of affordable and local authority housing in the old-fashioned sense. At present there is no competition between those in private rented accommodation, the investors who own that accommodation and the rest of the community. There is nobody to provide an alternative in that sector. It is completely controlled by the markets, the banking sector and the rising rents. Those people are in a very difficult situation. Would it be possible to pursue vigorously the use of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, to ensure that funds are made available?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	We have commenced that discussion and will continue it in conjunction with my Government colleagues. The strategic investment bank will be able to lend to builders. There is extant planning permission for a large number of units throughout the country but particularly in the greater Dublin area, including County Kildare, I hope. We want to see the construction industry up and running. Part V should have delivered a lot of units during the building boom as well but it did not. It delivered a very small percentage of units in comparison with the number built.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	Wexford County Council applied for funding of €733,000 this year to return units to people for housing but was granted only one third of that sum. Given that this is one of the cheaper ways to create housing, will the Minister of State explain why she did not give the council the rest of the money?I want to highlight something Michael Taft, research officer at the UNITE union, brought forward lately when he wrote on UNITE's website. It states:If by this time next year if [sic] there are people still homeless, it’s because the Government made a policy choice. €7 billion is being spent [this year] on paying down debt ... It comes from the Government’s considerable cash balances. At the end of 2013, the Government held €18.5 billion in cash. This is made up of money that has already been borrowed and revenue from bank investments ... The Government is taking the €7 billion and paying down Government debt to lower the debt/GDP ratio ... So let’s take half of that money the Government is using to pay down debt - €3.5 billion – and use it to build social houses, house the homeless and put some people back to work ... The €3.5 billion would build approximately 20,000 social houses ... The impact on employment would be considerable. 35,000 direct jobs would be created – that is, jobs on site. NERI estimates further job creation given the impact on downstream sectors (building supplies, transport) and the additional demand injected into the economy.It is hardly rocket science to suggest this would be a good way to move forward and address many problems. It would create employment and deal with homelessness and the need for social housing. It would be good for the economy all round.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I was going to put the same question to the Minister of State. Why did the Government choose to pay down €7 billion of the debt? Why was some of that money not used to build social housing? Has the Government been in contact with the European Investment Bank about the €500 million that could be accessed there? Is it thinking about using money to buy properties, apartments or houses? That would allow people to move into accommodation immediately and meet some of the need that exists. Families are finding themselves out on the streets every single day of the week. There is a concern that the long-term homeless could be left behind because of the focus on trying to get families into homes. They have spent years waiting and campaigning for a roof over their heads. They have produced many brilliant programmes and magazines over the years. I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about these matters.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I would like to refer briefly to the whole housing issue. The figures that have been given by the Minister of State with regard to new builds are tiny. They are a drop in the ocean. In the case of in County Laois, the figure will be six in 2014 and 2015. The money that is being provided is welcome. I think a figure of €70,000 has been mentioned with regard to County Laois. This shows the number of voids in the county is quite small, which is a good thing. Something more substantial is needed in this context. I suggest that the Minister of State have to look off the balance sheet. Along with other Deputies on this side of the House, I have suggested some methods of trying to raise money off the balance sheet and start a major social housing programme. We are facing something like what we faced in the 1950s and the 1930s. There are huge problems out there. I do not think the scale of this massive problem has been absorbed by the Government. I accept that the problem was already there when the Government came into power, but it has grown since then. There is always a problem with a shortage of social housing, but there is an absolute crisis at the moment. It has to be dealt with by the Government. It cannot be left to the voluntary agencies, which are building up huge stocks of housing. I do not have a problem with the voluntary agencies per se. I want the problem to be solved. The Government is brewing up a problem down the line. Neither the local authority nor the Government at national level has control over the housing stock. They do not have the title deeds of the houses. This is a huge problem that is brewing up in the housing sector. It would not exist if the Government or the local authority had the title deeds, or if the tenant purchased the house and wound up with the title deeds permanently. The Minister of State needs to watch that and be careful as she moves forward.

In addition, they are not for profit. Therefore, those houses are there for social housing purposes.

We have applied for €100 million from the European Investment Bank, about which Deputy Joan Collins asked. We expect to get an answer in the late summer.The funding will mainly go towards refurbishing local authority flats in the cities. Should we be successful in securing that funding, as we hope to be, it will involve a significant number of units. Regarding the purchase of accommodation, I recently gave funding for the purchase of houses for people with special needs, physical disability and so on. With regard to homelessness, we have an implementation plan in place. Deputy Joan Collins raised the situation of those persons whom one might call the more traditional homeless. Their needs are central to our implementation planning. We are pursuing a housing-led approach to move them out of temporary hostel-type accommodation as soon as possible and into supported housing.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	This issue has been raised by my colleague, Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, in the past. It concerns the outstanding legislation that needs to be enacted in order for local authorities to take in charge estates, in the context of the complication that has arisen by virtue of Irish Water having taken over a range of water infrastructure. Will the Minister of State indicate what legislation is necessary and when it will be brought forward to address the delay that is happening in many parts of the country in the taking in charge of various estates by local authorities?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 87 and 104 together. Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, sets out the process by which local authorities can take in charge housing estates. When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a planning authority must take in charge any roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains or drains within the attendant grounds of the development. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by ministerial order to Irish Water. Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities.  In Circular PL 21/13, issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, it was stated that legislative amendments to clarify further the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates would be made in 2014. My Department is currently considering, in consultation with Irish Water, what amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will be required in this regard. In addition, in consultation with Irish Water and the local authorities, we are working on developing a protocol for the taking in charge of estates. This protocol will be finalised shortly, following which further advice will be issued to local authorities on this matter.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I thank the Minister of State for her response. It seems clear that an error was made by those charged with responsibility for bringing forward legislation to satisfy everybody concerned in regard to Irish Water taking over the provision of water services. This delay, as the Minister of State acknowledged, is ongoing and is causing great concern to people living in estates which continue in a dilapidated state because they cannot be taken in charge. She indicated that she is in consultation with the various authorities with a view to bringing forward amendments to section 180 of the relevant Act. When can we expect to see those provisions? This issue has been long enough going on that she should be in a position now to indicate when the legislation will be forthcoming so that the problem can be resolved. Can we expect it to be brought forward before the recess?

In regard to legislative changes, I expect any such changes to be included in the forthcoming planning Bill, which will be enacted in the autumn session.

Grouping questions together in this manner provides good exercise for the heart as we race to get to the Chamber on time.I raised this issue of the taking in charge of housing estates with the Minister of State at the last Question Time. The legislation stated that a petition had to be signed by the majority of persons on the register of electors but this was subsequently amended to state the majority of the owners. Will the Minister of State clarify why that amendment was introduced? Is she aware of the difficulties this causes where there may be an absentee landlord and where people may be in financial difficulties with the banks and the last thing they want to do is to go cap in hand to them to try to get copies of their deeds? Will the Minister of State revisit this in the forthcoming legislation?

However, sometimes one third or up to 50% of houses are owned by landlords. Straightaway, there is a problem in trying to get documentation and deeds from them. Sadly, in my constituency, as in many parts of the country, a lot of people are in huge financial difficulty with banks and are trying to make mortgage repayments to them. They are trying to avoid being terrorised by the banks and the last thing they want to do is to go into banks to get copies of their deeds to prove to the local authority that they own their houses.

The intention here is not to put obstacles in the way of the taking in charge of a housing estate. The deeds of a house are normally held by a solicitor and it should not be particularly onerous to get them. We are reviewing planning legislation and if we need to look at this again, we will do so. The national committee on unfinished estates, which I chair, has discussed the whole issue of the taking in charge of housing estates and where there are obstacles and difficulties in regard to this. I can undertake to have it discussed at that committee to see if anything needs to be done.

Perhaps she has got a briefing since that has said the opposite. My deeds are held by the bank and not a solicitor as is the case with the vast majority of mortgage holders in this country. There are estates where developers still own quite a number of houses and where houses may be held by NAMA or a receiver. Where works are completed, surely it is in everyone's interest that an estate is taken in charge. I can give the Minister of State instances in my constituency where estates have been completed for a number of years but the residents have not been able to get the majority of the owners of those properties to sign a petition to have the estate taken in charge. In those instances, the developer has gone into liquidation so it is not possible for the developer to do so. A limbo-type situation has been created because of the change in the legislation. All I am asking is that this amendment to the legislation is reversed to facilitate the taking in charge of these estates, which was the objective of the amendment in the first place.

As I said to Deputy Cowen, we will bring planning legislation before the House later in the year. The intention was never to make this difficult but to facilitate the process because as we all agree, it is in everybody's interest to take estates in charge as soon as possible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	It is 18 months since I began to raise the issue of the removal of discretionary medical cards from very sick children and people with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions with the Taoiseach. In fairness, he has moved from a position of total denial of any policy change, which resulted in a dramatically high number of cards being removed from so many deserving people, to blaming a systems failure. The latest phrase given to this policy decision of the Government is an "unintended consequence of a budgetary decision" which is how the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, put it today. I put it to the Taoiseach that is some hell of an unintended consequence for thousands of families across the country because it has put families through hell and back in terms of the anxiety and the stress caused and the expense many have had to incur. Today, there was an announcement by the Minister for Health in regard to a decision which the Government says will restore some of these discretionary medical cards which have been removed from people and we hear it will be around 15,000 such cards. I put it to the Taoiseach that the removal of these cards is going on as we speak. I do not know if the Taoiseach read page 10 of the Irish Daily Mail today which highlighted the desperate case of young Cormac O'Neill, a 12 year old born with a rare filamin A gene disorder. The family spent €850 in one month alone on his medicines as the card was taken from him. I received details of another case yesterday from the mother of a child with a very rare condition. In that case, the card was removed from a 13 year old with multiple disabilities and I can give the Taoiseach details of the case. I received details of a third case of a five year old who lost the medical card which he has had since he was two years of age. It is unbelievable that this continues. In regard to the decision which has been taken, will the Taoiseach outline to the House how many cards will be restored? Will all of those who lost discretionary medical cards have them restored? Will those who lost medical cards as a result of this decision be refunded for the cost of medication they have incurred since the discretionary medical cards were wrongly taken from them? Given all of the stress and anxiety caused, will the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, apologise to all the families concerned who wrongly had their discretionary medical cards taken from them?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	This matter is not as simple as it looks. The Minister for Health brought a memorandum before the Government today to approve the reinstatement by the HSE of cards withdrawn on foot of a person's circumstances where the HSE had considered that the exercise of discretion should be taken into account where medical circumstances applied.The period covered is 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014, inclusive. A decision was made to centralise the examination of medical card applications. Deputy Martin is aware that the exercise of the discretionary right to medical cards varied greatly from county to county. In some counties, depending on the nature of the examination, the approval rate for discretionary cards could be very high, while it was very low in others. The decision to centralise the system and to have equality of examination-----

I am very sorry that many of the cases that were brought to light on foot of the examination of discretion caused a great deal of stress for people. I will get the exact figure for Deputy Martin but approximately 13,000 cards will be restored to people who had cards that were awarded on a discretionary basis taken from them since the decision was taken to centralise the examination system. They should receive their cards back within the next four weeks. The question that arises is what one does in respect of ordinary medical cards for which applications are being made and on which a review continues and in cases where an appeal is lodged. The first criteria is to deal with cards that have been withdrawn that had been issued on a discretionary basis where undue hardship applied and where there were particular medical circumstances. A number of such cases were outlined in the House recently and the impact the withdrawal of the cards had on families. I have not seen the newspaper to which Deputy Martin referred, or the cases he outlined, but the decision made by the Government was to cease the review that was under way in respect of discretionary cards that had been awarded in order that people who have had a discretionary card given to them should continue to have one because of the suspension of the review process. I do not know the cases Deputy Martin spoke about but following the decision of the Government, those who have a discretionary medical card should continue to have it. I will have the cases checked. It is clear that the decision made today was to deal with those who had been awarded discretionary cards whose cards were withdrawn for whatever reason on review. The issue is an administrative one as distinct from a legal one. The point is to give the cards back to the people who had them awarded on discretion and who lost the card following the review.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	This is a very serious issue in that the Taoiseach has said 13,000 cards will be restored - the Minister said something similar in his press release, 15,000 - but the bottom line is that if one looks at the HSE performance report of January 2011, there were 80,000 discretionary medical cards. The reply we got at the end of April from the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, with whom the Taoiseach is very familiar, mentioned approximately 50,000 discretionary medical cards. That means 30,000 medical cards were taken from people in the interim, not 13,000 or 15,000. What about the other 15,000 people? Will they have their discretionary medical cards restored?

I quoted from official sources - the HSE performance report of January 2011 and Parliamentary Question No. 540 of 10 June 2014. The number of discretionary medical cards reduced from 80,000 to 50,000, which means 30,000 cards were taken back. Will those who lost their medical cards also receive a refund because clearly by restoring them in the aftermath of the elections the Government has accepted that they were wrongly taken? Can I take it that all the extra costs for medication and therapy will be restored to those who lost their cards? Critically, we want to find out about the other 15,000 who have had their discretionary medical cards taken from them and who should also have them restored.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	I listened to the Minister for Health announce on RTE Radio the restoration of some medical cards. It would have been far better if he had come into the Chamber to make the announcement and for it to be scrutinised, but that is not the way the Government works. I asked two weeks ago for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the appointment by him of the chairman of the west and north-west hospitals group. I asked the Taoiseach the same question last week. I am still waiting for an explanation. In the meantime, the individual has resigned. Incidentally, the Minister's first response to a question from Teachta Ó Caoláin was to defend the appointment but to date no explanation either for the resignation or the original appointment has been given to the Dáil or the public. Last week, I also asked the Taoiseach what has happened to the original files on which decisions were made about people's entitlement to a discretionary medical card, which the Ombudsman said are lost.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	138	I am talking about the record of the Minister for Health and I am also trying to get answers from the Taoiseach to questions which I have asked three weeks in a row. The Ombudsman says the files are missing.I raised this with the Taoiseach and while officials from his office got in touch with my office, I am still awaiting a reply on this matter. I welcome today's announcement and commend those citizens who fought to achieve this U-turn. There are, however, questions the Taoiseach has not answered and which the Minister is not available to answer. Will those citizens adversely affected through the removal of their medical cards be compensated for the hardship and costs they endured as a result? Will he confirm the administrative cost of this change will not be taken from front-line services? Given the confusion and distress caused by his Government’s handling of this entire issue, will he state clearly that everyone who needs a medical card will get one? Will he agree this embarrassing U-turn is further evidence that his Minister and Government are making up policy as they go along and that the Minister for Health should go?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	142	We recognise, following the centralising of the medical card system, that the inequality in the level of discretionary cards awarded was higher is some parts of the country than in others. In other words, some counties had a very high level of discretionary cards awarded while others did not. In the centralising of that system, clearly significant numbers of families where there were children, in particular, with complicated medical circumstances were very badly stressed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	This has been the case for the past two years.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	I regret that very much. The decision made by the Government today is to restore discretionary medical cards that were withdrawn on review from July 2011 to May 2014. It will cost €13 million but will not be taken, as the Deputy put it, through a reduction in further front-line services. The Government decided today that this will be dealt with later. It is also true that between July 2011 and May 2014 approximately 10,000 discretionary medical cardholders did not respond to or complete the review process. Neither did approximately 4,500 discretionary GP cardholders. I do not know the numbers at this stage who may qualify under that process. The Minister for Health has no objection at all to coming into the House to give details of the individual numbers if Deputy Adams wishes to put down a public notice question. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle may in time reflect on that. The important point here is the Government has made a decision to restore those discretionary medical cards that were withdrawn on review from people. They should have those cards returned to them in the next four weeks.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	The clinical panel set up by the Minister will continue its work on the assessment of the medical circumstances that will allow for people to avail of medical facilities based on medical grounds. That is an area in which we all can have an input in the time ahead.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	The Taoiseach has still not answered my question on the missing files on discretionary medical cards or on the resignation of the former chair of the west and north-west hospitals group. Coming back to the issue of medical cards, that was a Cabinet decision. While we think the Minister should go, men, mainly, sat around a table, decided upon this and it is then explained away as an unintended consequence.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	150	I do not genuinely understand how, when the decision was made to remove medical cards, someone did not have the wit or the social conscience to ask what the likely consequences would be. Will the Taoiseach explain how this Cabinet decision was made? Similar decisions were made to take away allowances from people with disabilities, for example. There is all sorts of confusion about the figures. The Minister spoke about 15,300 people being affected. The Taoiseach spoke about 13,000, while Mr. John Hennessy, director of primary care, quoted a figure of 30,000 and the Minister of State, Deputy White, 50,000. A while back, the figure used to be 80,000. Will everyone who needs a medical card get one? The restoration of some medical cards has been described as a temporary decision. Will the Taoiseach explain what this means?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	I answered the Deputy’s question last week in respect of the resignation of Mr. Daly from the west and north-west hospitals group. I stated then that after this was brought to the Minister’s attention, he was dealing with it in a very serious fashion.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	Why did he resign? It was the Minister who appointed him and defended him.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	153	An issue arose with a conflict of interest about the awarding of a measure of work to a company associated with the former chairman. When this was brought to the attention of the Minister, it was dealt with seriously and the chairman resigned. I understand Mr. John Killeen has assumed the role of interim chairperson of the board. I answered that question for Deputy Adams last week. As Deputy Adams will be aware, the current legislative base for the issuing of a medical card is the Health Act 1970. What it is concerned with is undue hardship which is defined with reference to household means. When a person applies for a medical card, the question asked is if there is undue hardship based on the household means. If a person is ruled out of receiving a medical card on that basis, then one then has to see how much discretion could apply to deal with a particular undue hardship. That was, however, implemented in a very uneven fashion and, accordingly, in an unfair fashion. In some places discretionary cards were issued with very little analysis and in others with very stringent analysis. The equalisation of that process resulted in many thousands of people being severely affected. The Minister has asked the clinical panel to examine the setting out of a policy framework that will take account of medical conditions as a method for having access to medical facilities. In fact, the Health Act 1970 does not specifically refer to medical cards but to the issue of access to medical facilities based on undue hardship, taking into account household incomes. The Government’s decision today is clear. All those who lost the discretionary card awarded to them on the basis of the central review from July 2011 will have those cards restored on an administrative basis. They should have them back within the next four weeks. That means that people who have lost a medical card awarded on discretionary grounds because of exceptional medical issues will have those cards restored to them.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	The whole issue of inquiries has been very much in vogue with much chatter over the weekend. The focus, however, has been on the wrong inquiries. It is quite clear that the toothless banking inquiry is not going to expose anything, except maybe a few politicians to a bit of badly needed publicity.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	It has dawned on many citizens now that the Oireachtas inquiry into banking has about as much chance of getting to the bottom of what happened in the banking sector as Billy Bunter would have in finding out who robbed the school tuckshop. It is a joke. Instead, maybe the Taoiseach will focus on a different inquiry, one which might have the chance of actually succeeding, if he had the will to set it up in an appropriate manner. I refer to the statement yesterday by the broad cross-section of academics, NGOs and public figures which presented a cast-iron case for why a public inquiry into the policing of the Corrib gas project should be held. Everybody accepts that our mechanisms for Garda accountability have been found not to be fit for purpose. Is it not logical against this backdrop of one of the longest-running police operations in the history of the State, in an area deemed to be the most heavily policed in Europe, coincidentally in the Taoiseach's backyard, where more than 100 complaints to GSOC have been made, that the Taoiseach would agree this obviously should be the subject of an independent inquiry? Such an inquiry has been sought for a long time by national and international human rights campaigners such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders. The campaign yesterday outlined 22 reasons such an inquiry needs to take place, ranging from the lack of legality of arresting people without charge, protesters being hospitalised, phone tapping-----

Is the Taoiseach aware of the continued police harassment and intimidation of the local community, including a very serious incident in Pollatomish the weekend before last?

This is to be welcomed. I am also aware of and have had occasion in the past to visit members of the Rossport and Pollatomish area when they were in Wheatfield prison. I have had engagement with them over the years. I have also had engagement with the many Irish people who have been working on the site over the past 14 years. I am not aware of the minutes of the Shell committee meeting in London before this began, but I am aware that when this was first put in place by Enterprise Oil, it was badly handled in the beginning on many sides. As one more notable than I stated, were one to do things again, one might do them very differently or some things not at all.

He seems to be very well versed with the propaganda of Shell, as is his colleague sitting in front of me, Deputy Grealish. Perhaps he got this information on his visit in February when he took time out to go to Shell and meet it on site. He has not shown the same enthusiasm to meet people in the area, such as Mrs. McGrath in whose kitchen he felt comfortable enough to make a cup of tea on a previous occasion. This woman, who is 73, was manhandled by 30 gardaí outside her pub in the early hours of the morning between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. less than ten days ago.

The Taoiseach told us previously that the acting Garda Commissioner represents a new police force. Will the Taoiseach make contact with this family, in whose kitchen he drank tea before he reached his elevated status, and ask them what happened? The man in the house had a stroke over what went on. He was in his bedroom listening to his wife being manhandled on the street by gardaí. Young gardaí jeered at him and made fun of him knowing about his health and asking him to come down.

Will he tell us how this possibly represents a new Garda force?

I do not accept the Deputy's argument that all of this trouble is caused by people from the locality. I have been in many of their houses, and I went there recently to look at the standards employed and to speak to Irish engineers and environmental engineers whose careers depend on the standards and quality of work they have implemented. Deputy Daly would be welcome there to see the standards. I respect the difficulties faced by local families but the company has worked with local communities in many areas providing opportunities for young people through scholarships to fulfil their educational potential and other community issues and it has grown with the communities.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together. On 7 February, accompanied by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Education and Skills, I undertook a working visit to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, in Paris. Our programme included a series of meetings with senior officials from the organisation, as well as a public event attended by the media.  The OECD’s Secretary General, Angel Gurría, had previously visited Dublin in September 2013 to mark the organisation’s launch of its biennial economic survey of Ireland. At that time, we discussed Ireland’s economic prospects and exchanged ideas on how the OECD could more valuably contribute to the formulation of economic and social policy in the country. The working visit to Paris therefore allowed the Government to assess progress since then and to identify more specific areas where OECD expertise and analysis could assist the Government's continuing reform programme. We also touched on the importance of Ireland's exit without a backstop facility from the troika programme for both improving market confidence and securing more favourable borrowing rates. The key focus, however, of the discussions on 7 February was on job creation and reducing unemployment, areas where the OECD has significant expertise and experience. The OECD’s view, which I share, is that Ireland has made important strides in this context, especially in terms of structural reforms, but that much more needs to be done. Its officials noted that youth unemployment remains a serious challenge and we must ensure that Ireland's workforce is increasingly equipped with the skills needed for a modern, 21st century economy such as our own. We also had useful exchanges with the organisation’s experts on domestic labour activation strategies that can help jobseekers find suitable employment. The global economic situation has an obvious bearing on an export-driven economy like that of Ireland and I therefore was interested to hear the OECD’s views on the broader international economic environment. Its assessment was that the recovery of the global economy is progressing at a moderate pace but urgent action still is required to address structural weaknesses that remain from the crisis. The OECD is well-known as an authority on tax issues and we had a short discussion with it on the efforts the organisation leads to combat international tax evasion and avoidance. Mr. Gurría welcomed the Government's support for the OECD's work on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and for its co-operation with the OECD on tax matters. In light of the discussions in February, the Government is now working with the OECD to select specific projects and areas for further co-operation. Possibilities in this regard include enhancing the performance of the national innovation system, strengthening the Government's public supports for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and entrepreneurship, including a particular focus on access to finance, a renewed emphasis on the role of towns and cities in unlocking the economic potential of the regions and stronger co-operation in the area of public governance more generally, including through better regulation. In an increasingly knowledge-intensive and interconnected global economy, Ireland's long-standing membership of the OECD has never been more important. I am confident that our visit to Paris in February will provide the basis for a stronger level of co-operation with the organisation across all areas of public policy in the months ahead and beyond.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	Eight questions in total have been linked to the Taoiseach's visit to the OECD in Paris. I put it to the Taoiseach that right now, there is something close to panic in Europe about the threat of deflation and its potential dramatic impact on growth. What is somewhat incredible is I have yet to hear from the Taoiseach a single word on the threat the impact of deflation across Europe represents for Ireland. When replying to me, can the Taoiseach explain why he has not made a public statement on this issue? The OECD recently published an evaluation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the Government's press release in this regard probably was one of the most deliberately misleading, in a long line of over-hyped press releases, to which Members are used. I believe the Government press release stated the OECD had said the action plan was delivering tens of thousands of jobs but of course the OECD said no such thing. It stated directly that it cannot state how many, if any, jobs came from the action plan and that the improving international economy has been by far the biggest driver of jobs growth. However, this is what tends to happen with press releases. The OECD also criticised the lack of progress on youth unemployment, which is a particular scourge at this point in time, both in this country and across the European Union. What is important is to tell it as it is to people, because people are somewhat fed up with the over-spin on a general basis, because it does not accord with the daily realities they face in respect of employment, life, incomes and so on. As for the corporation tax issue, I believe one must state in an assertive way that Ireland's corporation tax rules are in accordance with OECD guidelines on taxation. In his reply, the Taoiseach has stated the issue of corporation tax was discussed with the OECD. It appears to me that the OECD does not necessarily have a problem with Ireland's regime or framework. I put it to the Taoiseach that he has not been proactive enough in making the case definitively for retaining autonomy in setting our own corporate tax rate, as well as having flexibility in our tax structure in general, both in respect of inward investment and to encourage entrepreneurial activity. Does the Taoiseach accept that the disparaging references in the United States Senate and the House of Commons to Ireland's corporation tax regime have caused significant reputational damage to our tax system? In addition, does he accept they potentially have created challenges for Ireland in respect of foreign direct investment into the future, in that they are undermining certainty about our framework into the future? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government has not treated this issue with the seriousness it deserves since the initial European probe was launched nine months ago. I believe the Government has been complacent and dismissive and I do not believe it has allayed the concerns of the European Union to prevent a formal inquiry. One must repeat there are no special corporate tax rates in Ireland. There are rules on how taxable income is calculated to determine the figure to which the 12.5% rate is applied and they are set out clearly. The Taoiseach and I are both aware but I ask him to confirm that companies such as Apple, for example, eventually will pay 35% in corporation tax when global profits are repatriated to the United States. The problem for the United States is that companies are deferring indefinitely this tax by holding the money offshore and not repatriating it. Does the Taoiseach accept this is a United States problem, not an Irish problem? It is facilitated by an exemption granted by the United States, rather than by any provision in the Irish tax code. The headline corporation tax rate is only one consideration in assessing a country's corporate tax regime.I ask the Taoiseach to provide details of the discussion he had with the OECD about the taxation question. I refer to BEPS - base erosion and profit shifting. I ask him to confirm that the international trend is to cut corporation tax rather than increasing it. I have noted what is happening in the United Kingdom with the patent box and its stated aim to reduce its corporation tax in an attempt to attract inward investment. Would he agree that a one-size-fits-all tax regime would not work for Europe? I refer to last week's press release from the Department of Finance which stated that the subject of transfer pricing up to 2010 was being examined and that the corporate tax rate was not being examined by the European Union. I ask him to outline to the House what has the European Commission told the Government in this regard. What does the Government propose to do in response to the EU probe?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	The Minister for Finance has been active on this matter. It is clearly an issue and I expect it will be discussed next week at the European Council. I expect that Mr. Draghi will be in attendance at some stage during the course of that two-day meeting and that he will deal in some detail with the threat as he has outlined it. Deputy Martin is well aware of the importance of the corporate tax rate as a cornerstone for investment in the country. I can confirm from my meetings last week in the United States that the line of investment into the country is very strong. It is not a question about the rate of corporation tax because that has never been questioned. There have been discussions in different member states and sectors about the fluctuation in rates. Britain has had discussions about this and the Prime Minister has commented about the outcome of his intention to make a decision about the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland once the outcome of the Scottish referendum is known. The question has never been raised about the rate of corporate tax. The Commission has given notice of launching an investigation into a number of countries, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and, in the case of Ireland, in respect of Apple.  Last week I had a meeting with the senior personnel in Apple in California. This is about a specific technical issue, about a specific instance for a company, which is that any company is entitled to speak to Revenue in respect of the options that might be considered when making a decision to invest in Ireland. The question of the corporate tax is one of statute-based law and is not one that allows for specific deals for any individual company. This is an important point. The Government on behalf of the country will defend this very robustly in that our legislation is statute-based and we believe it is ethically implemented and that therefore it does not constitute a state aid. The announcement by the Commission is in respect of its intention to look at a specific issue of a technical nature related to one particular company and it is not dealing with the rate of corporate tax as it applies. In reply to the Deputy's other question, I refer to the role of the OECD in respect of base erosion and profit shifting. Most companies that use these BEPS strategies to reduce the amount of tax they pay take advantage of mismatches or different rates and regimes between the tax rules in different countries, making it difficult for any single country fully to address the issue. There is a need to provide an international and a joined-up approach which would reinforce domestic efforts as well as protecting tax bases and providing comprehensive international solutions to the problem. That is where the OECD comes into play in that it is co-ordinating an international response to deal with these challenges through its BEPS project. The OECD BEPS action plan published in July 2013 sets out 15 specific actions to deal with the problems of base erosion and profit shifting. The plan provides a timetable for the completion of these various steps spanning five separate areas, namely, the digital economy, coherence, substance, transparency and the formulation of a new multilateral instrument. The timetable for their completion is from September this year to December 2015. The fundamental goal of the project is to better align the right to tax with real economic substance and activity. This issue of substance and taxation is a core pillar of the Irish taxation system. That is the reason the BEPS project is consistent with our tax strategy.  We fully support the important work of the OECD. This is an issue which is not limited to any one country, rather it represents a global challenge involving a wide variety of jurisdictions and companies and it accordingly requires a globally co-ordinated response such as that led by the OECD. We are committed to the process under way to ensure that what is termed the global architecture is fair and seen to be more equitable. We welcomed the original report in February 2013 which identified the problems and challenges. We fully support the action plan subsequently published in July 2013. Deputy Martin also referred to the question of youth unemployment and youth employment which is an issue in a number of countries. The OECD published tailored recommendations for each individual country. A number of Ministers attended that meeting to meet with the specialists in each area. Depending on the nature of the conversation, they recommended schemes or activities to deal with youth unemployment in the various countries. For example, a comprehensive review of the apprenticeship system was undertaken and has been completed recently. It examined apprenticeship training systems with a view to providing an updated model of training that delivers the necessary skilled workforce to service the needs of a rapidly changing economy. That review was progressed by an independent group which has made a series of recommendations and which prepared a comprehensive framework for a future expanded system of apprenticeship in Ireland. It suggested that the current system could be expanded to a number of other industries, including the ICT sector. For example, I met two companies last week and both said that they could employ 1,000 software engineers in the morning if they were available but we do not have them.  The taxpayer provides substantial funding for the board of SOLAS to be delivered through the new educational opportunities structures. It is a question of how to structure the apprenticeship training schemes to provide for industries requiring large numbers of trained personnel. The group also made recommendations about the existing apprenticeship trades. It was suggested that programmes should provide for the integration of various skills such as literacy, numeracy, mathematics, science, ICT and that these should be designed to equip the participants for progression to the next level. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, agree with this policy. Deputy Martin asked what actions are being taken to address the skills gaps in higher education. The Government and the OECD both recognise the importance of ensuring that Irish workers have the necessary skills to deal in a modern 21st century economy such as ours. We have the highest rate of tertiary enrolment in the EU and at 45%, Ireland has the third highest proportion in the EU of higher education students studying science and mathematics and ICT. I acknowledge Deputy Martin's involvement when he was Minister for Education. It was a good policy.

Some 1,500 ICT skills conversion places have been provided to date. Furthermore, 63% of demand for high level IT professionals is being met from the higher education system through the implementation of the ICT skills action plan. In 2011, the corresponding figure was 45% and we have set a target of reaching 75% by 2018. In addition, 15,000 Springboard places have been provided since 2011 in areas of identified high demand from enterprise. The 2014 round of the Springboard scheme, which will incorporate the ICT conversion programme, will be launched by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in June. Employer satisfaction with graduates is assessed through the national employer survey, the next round of which is due this year. According to the 2012 survey, 75% of employers are satisfied with the skills of Irish graduates.  This morning, I met Mr. Liu Yunshan, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who invited 200 Irish students to visit China to participate in a language summer camp. China is expanding its investment in Ireland and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will shortly visit the country. I expect the Minister will also be in a position to announce the first round of investment under the China-Ireland technology group growth capital fund.  Having spoken this morning to representatives of some of the major financial institutions, it is clear that this sector, in which more than 35,000 people are employed, offers further opportunities. Those to whom I spoke noted a radical shift in Ireland in the recent period and pointed out that the quality of talent coming through the system is second to none. This is creating a ripple effect across Europe, with Dublin in particular holding a magnetic attraction for many young people because of the numbers of companies located here and the energy and creativity that flows from that.  While we have made significant progress on unemployment, the rate is still too high. Access to credit is a major issue and one which the Government seeks to address. Today, for example, we made a number of changes to the credit scheme introduced for small companies by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in his action plan. As I have noted on a number of occasions, it is not for Governments to say how many jobs they create. The Action Plan for Jobs is a mechanism, if one likes, for easing the way to enable jobs to be created. Of the 60,000 jobs created last year, 40,000 were in companies that are less than five years old. This is indicative of the change that is under way.  Many of those who participated in the Enterprise Ireland boot camp and presented in the United States seeking investment from venture capital will sell exclusively on the Internet and they will not be restricted by any requirement to have a physical shop or the timelines that apply in such circumstances. Sales methods and demand and supply are changing radically.  The Government regularly engages with the OECD because it has a brilliant range of expertise available to it and is able to respond to specific queries on the design of schemes for young people that are appropriate to Ireland's circumstances, as opposed to those of Italy or Portugal, for example. The OECD wishes to continue with this type of engagement, which is done on the basis of catering for the changes that will take place in 18 months or five years and the requirement to structure our needs accordingly. These are some of the issues that were discussed. The issue of base erosion and product shifting, BEPS, was also discussed and the Government fully supports the position being taken.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	I propose to concentrate on the way in which the tax regime here is being used by some multinational companies to avoid paying tax in countries in which they operate. The Taoiseach acknowledged that this issue was raised at the OECD meeting in February. It is another mark of the dysfunctional nature of the process of engagement in the House that we are dealing with questions dating from February. In response to Teachta Martin, the Taoiseach stated that the corporation tax rate was not raised at the February meeting, which is welcome, and that this was a specific technical issue, which is more of a global problem than an Irish one. He also acknowledged that the issue was raised during his visit to California. The issue that captured the media headlines here and, I believe, in the United States, was the barbed joke made by California Governor, Jerry Brown, at an Enterprise Ireland event in San Francisco. The matter is, therefore, raised consistently.  I will outline some of the concerns that arise in this regard. At the end of September 2013, an Irish registered Google company had a revenue of €15.5 billion but paid only €17 million in corporation tax here. A US Senate hearing in Washington was also told that Apple had a special arrangement that provided a 2% tax rate and that one Irish registered subsidiary of the company had profits of €40 billion. The sums involved are substantial. The issue, which the Taoiseach described as technical, is that tax avoidance for multinational companies is facilitated through the funnelling of funds through this State into tax havens. I concur with the Taoiseach's previous comment that this State is not a tax haven. While his view is borne out, the fact that the money comes through Ireland means it is a matter of Irish tax law and enforcement in this State. I have other figures to hand but I am sure the Taoiseach has a sense of the issue in terms of royalties, licences and taxable profits that have been transferred out of the State. This issue is pertinent not only to Ireland but also the developing world where people depend on corporation tax income to support vital public services. As the Taoiseach is aware, people are dying from hunger and experiencing poverty. I recall that last September, at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York, the former US President, Bill Clinton, asked what major companies could do to support development in Africa. In response, Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British mobile communications businessman and billionaire, argued that global companies should pay taxes in Africa and it was not acceptable that they do not do so. Ireland has issues in this regard in terms of State law. The Taoiseach also referred to fairness. Where is the fairness in companies that make billions in Africa being able to funnel revenue through Ireland, thus avoiding tax in the country in which their wealth originates? Citizens, including Members of the Oireachtas, and small companies are correctly expected to pay tax, whereas multinational companies are being facilitated in avoiding paying tax. Sinn Féin's strong view is that the tax code must be organised in a fair and ethical manner.  The effect of this practice on the developing world means it is not merely a technical issue but an issue of tax justice. Surely Ireland cannot and should not be complicit in allowing money to be funnelled through this country in a manner that results in the developing world being robbed of income that could assist countries to emerge from poverty, save lives, prevent famine and be employed to promote economic growth and public services? I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on these points and respond.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	The discussions were not about the 12.5% corporation tax rate in place here as corporation tax is a matter for individual countries. The rate we have set has been a cornerstone of our policy for a very long time.I agree with Deputies Adams and Martin that the question of reputational damage is an issue. It arises from some of the comments made following the United States Senate hearings last year about this country being a tax haven when clearly Ireland does not qualify under any of the headings for tax haven status. It took a while to deal with that argument comprehensively and clearly. In view of reputational damage or perception of reputational damage, the Minister for Finance abolished the stateless concept in the budget last year. That was a clear decision to remove any perception of difficulty from an Irish point of view. Governor Brown's comments in California arose at an occasion where quite a number of small Irish companies had gone through an analysis and presentation of their products and what they intended to offer and pitched to potential investors in California to invest in their businesses. Some of them were very exciting concepts designed here by Irish people. Governor Brown certainly has a sense of humour and, obviously, people can play words the way they want. He has transformed the Californian economy, where there was a $27 billion deficit, to a point where it is making serious progress, not, I might add, without taking significant and difficult decisions. When Deputy Adams mentions companies paying the tax rate that applies here, it is important to state we do not have the brass-plate system in Ireland. For instance, I visited Apple in California last week. When one goes to its ultra-modern facility in Cork where over 4,000 highly-skilled people are employed one can understand the contribution it is making to the economy of Cork, both city and region, along with its presence in a number of other countries. Companies which employ significant numbers here pay the tax and their workers pay tax, but in the BEPS initiative the OECD is dealing with the 15 different areas internationally so that there can be an international response to have a fair system that everybody understands. We are participating fully, openly and comprehensively in that, and have done so from the outset. Deputy Adams raised a number of interesting points about Africa. Prior to the Olympic Games, British Prime Minister Cameron called a meeting in London with a number of African leaders who spoke about discrimination against women and young girls, discrimination in education, corruption and the difficulties that many countries in the African continent experience. It is evident, if the population of Africa doubles in the next 20 years, as it probably will, that even if 10% of young males were to decide to emigrate from the African Continent, no country in Europe could withstand the scale of that pressure and it is necessary that democratisation and anti-corruption measures be put in place in Africa. A number of African leaders addressed the G8 summit in Lough Erne and what they said was startling in its effect in that companies, and in some cases countries, which do deals with phenomenal amounts of African land, supply all the legal requirements at the start of a contract but there is never an analysis as to the impact for the peoples, the tribes or the economies of the regions. The point was made by President Obama at that meeting that the G8 could supply expertise and experience in contract law and treaty agreements so that African countries or their regions would be able to avail of the best expertise on what they are being asked to sign. An example would be the rape of the land for mineral extraction to no benefit for the African people or the regional economies. Some of the leaders gave examples of where a truck-load of mineral clay or whatever driving 20 miles might be stopped 50 to 100 times for payment. There is an issue here that goes to the heart of the matter, that is, corruption and greed. Clearly, significant amounts of money have been drifting into some bank accounts to the disadvantage of millions of people, tribes and local areas. That was an issue on which the G8 was to follow up, where expertise could be made available to countries and regions to state what they are being asked to do, what is the agreement that they are being asked to sign and how is it that there cannot be much greater benefit for the people and the area depending on the nature of the contract in place. I suppose, when the gentleman Deputy Adams quotes states that all companies should pay their taxes in Africa, perhaps that may be a reason that some do not. In any event, Ireland's participation and support for the OECD's work on the BEPS covering the 15 areas that I mentioned to Deputy Martin is something that we hope can bring about an international response to the different regimes that apply in different countries. Ireland's participation in the OECD does not mean that we have to change our tax laws. The OECD does not have the power to do that. It is anticipated that the OECD analysis of BEPS will result in changes being made to the international taxation rule-book on which countries rely for international trade. We always have played by these rules and that is evidenced by the extent of the strength of the continued line of investment into the country. These issues are under active consideration. We participate in that, openly and fully, and we look forward to dealing with the response. The Commission's investigation is not a global issue. The Commission's investigation here in Ireland is on a specific technical point for a specific company. That is not an issue that applies globally. The Commission has a slightly different investigation taking place in Luxembourg and in the Netherlands with other companies. The bigger picture is how does one respond to the digital world having moved so far ahead of the legislative world that companies can move through different jurisdictions, regimes and tax operations before a baseline is reached. For us, with companies here in Ireland, there are no brass-plate operations. We believe strongly that, as ours is a statute-based law, it is not a state aid and it is ethically implemented. We work on that upfront basis with the OECD and we will defend our position strongly with the European Commission.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	The Taoiseach began by speaking about youth unemployment being discussed at the OECD meeting but he did not outline whether any concrete proposals came from the OECD regarding the scandal of the extent of youth unemployment throughout the European Union, particularly in the so-called peripheral states, the victims of austerity, where up to half the young people available for work are unemployed. Can he outline whether, apart from platitudes by the OECD establishment, there were any proposals for concrete investment in those societies that would lead to young people finding meaningful work and a decent future which the current system does not give them?This also relates to the issue of corporation tax. I do not know if the Taoiseach reads the international financial press, but there have been articles about the massive extent of accumulated profits by major corporations that lie in banks and other financial institutions around the world. In the case of Europe, for example, an estimated €3 trillion is not invested by European corporations within the EU but is running around the banking system. That is because those corporations judge it is not sufficiently profitable for them to invest in infrastructure or new employment and jobs.  That begs the question of whether a different and new tax regime is needed, not just in this country but also throughout Europe. Those companies should be taxed at a much higher rate so that those funds, which in any case are earned by the hands and brains of working people around Europe, should be available for public investment, for example, in major infrastructural projects which are desperately needed in every European country. That would put literally millions of people to work.  Is that not a crying condemnation of the type of corporate tax regime that the Taoiseach and his Government insist on keeping in this country? The headline rate here is among the lowest in the EU. Nobody believes the Taoiseach or the institution of paid advisers when they say the effective rate is 11.9%. Everybody knows that there is a huge tax scam going on in this country as far as major corporations are concerned. Professor Stewart of Trinity College put the corporate tax rate between 2% and 3%, while Social Justice Ireland put it at 6.2%. If we are generous and say that the effective corporate tax rate is 8%, based on 2012 figures every percentage extra they would pay would be €525 million. Therefore if they paid the full rate of 12.5%, which is a derisory amount, it would be €2 billion extra. Does the Taoiseach not agree that in a country that is crucified by austerity, where our people are hurting badly through massive extra taxation, property tax and the projected water tax, these funds should be taxed? Given the current situation, corporations should be made to pay. The Taoiseach's position in blankly stating that 12.5% is adequate as a headline rate and that corporations here pay about that rate, is completely unsustainable.  Does the Taoiseach not understand that an increasing subject of discussion, debate and controversy around the world, but particularly in Europe and the United States, is the growing inequality between the tiny elite, 1% to 5% of populations, at the top who continue to accumulate massive wealth even in years of austerity, while ordinary people suffer? Society and services are also suffering. Will it ever dawn on the Taoiseach to point out these issues at EU fora, rather than being part of the current establishment regime's thinking which is hugely destructive of society? It is giving rise to massive and growing inequality, and is actually criminal. Does the Taoiseach see no responsibility for the Irish Government there?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	We have no problem on that. The question of youth employment was discussed at the meeting with OECD personnel. The details of this have been considered at length by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Social Protection. The OECD was critical of the Government regarding the lack of action concerning labour activation measures, as they call them. The EU and the IMF criticised us to some extent in this regard also. By and large, however, international organisations have been supportive of the approach taken by the Government to reduce unemployment and boost job creation. We always welcome advice, ideas and recommendations on how we might improve our performance in that context. The Pathways to Work programme will remain a central feature of the Government's jobs plan in 2014. The OECD's input will have an important role as we refine that and examine it for the future. In late 2013, the OECD was commissioned to provide a commentary on Irish youth employment policies and to advise on the implementation of the EU recommendation about a youth guarantee for employment. That work was completed at the end of 2013 and was a helpful input into drawing up the youth guarantee implementation plan, which was approved by Government and published in January this year. The OECD also regularly advised on aspects of Irish labour market policy, as was the case in its economic survey of Ireland published last year, and most recently in its review of the Action Plan for Jobs. In that review, the OECD was positive in its assessment of labour market reforms but concluded that more needed to be done. There is nothing new about that. This view is shared by the Government, as evidenced by the additional measures being taken under the Pathways to Work 2013 programme. These include the extension of activation to those who are long-term unemployed and the continuing reallocation of staff to front-line activation work. Some 300 additional case officers were put in place in late 2013. All elements of the Pathways to Work programme will be reviewed and, if necessary, augmented and refined in Pathways to Work 2014 which is due around the middle of the year. I have dealt before in detail with the question of the effective rate of corporation tax here coming down to 11.9%. The Deputy has estimated evidence to the contrary and we have discussed that before. The ones that really count, however, put Ireland's effective rate at approximately 11.9%, which is very close to 12.5%. It obviously depends on the statistics used. We are a small but important entity in a very big world where different jurisdictions, regimes and tax rates apply. Many companies are involved in multi-country situations, which is why Ireland has been upfront in recognising that we need to deal with this in a fair and equitable fashion. That is why we contribute to the 15 sectoral committees the OECD is working on.I am very happy to defend the Commission investigation into a specific technical issue relating to a specific company. It is fair to say that a great deal of international finance is sloshing around the system, much of which is available for investment. One of the problems about Ireland is that it has never produced the range of projects that would draw sufficient funds for investment in infrastructure. That is why I was glad to see that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation were in a position to put together significant packages for investment through stimulus, whether for road developments, bundles of schools or the Grangegorman development in Dublin city centre. These major investment requirements will draw on elements of the finance that is out there. Our position is that we are continuing to maintain our corporate tax rate and are dealing robustly with the Commission investigation. We will work upfront and comprehensively with the OECD and other countries. At the European Council meeting at which this was agreed last year, there was agreement from everybody, including countries that were silent on the matter in the past, that an international response is needed on the issue of tax regimes in different countries and the different rates that apply. The projections for Ireland in the coming period are interesting. The unemployment rate is projected to decrease to 11.5% in 2014, 10.5% in 2015, 9.7% in 2016 and 8% by 2018. That is in keeping with the medium-term economic strategy that the Government published when we exited the programme of assistance at the end of last year. Our projections for growth and GDP and GNP are set out in the economic programme up to 2018. The emphasis this year is on construction, services and retail, as well as the efforts now being made by the Government to put together an exciting programme in respect of construction to deal with housing, social housing and other infrastructures. I hope this will bring about significant job creation for people who are on the unemployment register and were previously involved in various aspects of the construction sector, and for those who come with new skills and new ways of dealing with this. That is all part of the fabric of the Government's work to create more jobs, increase income and continue to grow and strengthen our economy to make it easier for the Minister for Finance to meet the targets we have set ourselves of reducing the deficit to below 3% by 2015 and eliminating it by 2018. I do not accept the assertion of the independent Fiscal Advisory Council that the rate of projection we have is faster than the EU's. We set out our targets in the medium-term economic plan and we expect to be able to adhere to them.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee on Global Taxation, to which Professor Jim Stewart was giving evidence. He was asked by Deputies from various parties to back up his assertion that the real corporate tax rate in this country - the so-called effective rate - is only 2.2%. He was categorical about it. Whereas the Government claims the corporate tax rate is 11.9%, virtually every international commentator and a minority of us in this House say that is nonsense and that, in reality, these big multinationals are paying a fraction of that amount. Professor Stewart was absolutely clear in stating the figure was much closer to 2.2%. He pointed out that in Irish tax law - not American tax law or any other country's law - the norm is that if a company is incorporated in this country, it is deemed to be tax resident here and that foreign-owned companies are the only exception to that norm. It appears that a different set of rules is applied to foreign-owned companies. There is one law for Irish companies and another law for the multinationals. That double standard in how we judge companies' liabilities for tax purposes allows them to shift massive amounts of profits abroad and to claim the profits are made in the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda when, as Professor Stewart pointed out, these companies have employees here in respect of whom they pay PRSI, they pay VAT and they occupy offices in this country. Somehow, they claim they are owned and controlled in Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands, where they have no offices or employees, and do not even have telephone numbers. The Revenue Commissioners simply conclude they are owned and controlled in the Cayman Islands or the Virgin Islands. He rightly pointed out this is not a reasonable assessment of where they are owned and controlled. In so far as one can reasonably allocate their profits, any reasonable person would say those profits should be allocated here. Irish tax law states that a company incorporated here is normally regarded as tax resident. Is it not obvious that we are facilitating incredible tax evasion from these multinational companies? That option is not available to Irish companies and small and medium enterprises. It is solely available to enormously profitable multinationals. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that. Professor Stewart was very convincing and he knew the Irish tax code very well. Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain further. Professor Stewart also suggested that while we may not be the only country that could be described as having features of a tax haven, we are in the same category as Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all of which are also being investigated for being tax havens or countries with the features of tax havens. The way in which we interpret and apply our tax laws is facilitating this. The Taoiseach stated that we do not have brass-plate companies. I discussed this subject with Professor Stewart in a telephone conversation, and he confirmed in his submission to the sub-committee and in a radio interview that one could wallpaper one's house with all the brass-plate companies in the IFSC. He put flesh on the bones of that when he pointed out that there are €2.1 trillion in assets in the IFSC. He asked why these assets do not show up on the national accounts. If even 1% of these assets appeared on the national accounts, they would amount to €20 billion. As the assets do not appear in the national accounts, clearly the companies are not paying taxes on them in any substantial way. Is that not the definition of a brass-plate company? I ask the Taoiseach to explain that to us. It strongly suggests that, contrary to his assertion, the IFSC is thronged with brass-plate companies which have no real linkages with the Irish economy. We cannot claim they are making a great contribution at any level to the economy.As Professor Stewart pointed out, they are here purely because it is easy to minimise tax liability in this State. In that sense we are again displaying features, as he put it, of a tax haven. The allegations being made against us have serious substance, although it is important to note they are not just being made against us, and they are also levelled at Holland, Luxembourg and Switzerland. We are at the top of the league table but in a race to the bottom on corporate tax issues and allowing multinationals to facilitate these practices.

The Irish Financial Services Centre is a place with multinationals which employ significant numbers of people here. The allegation is always that a multinational based in Ireland, where people are employed, is not paying its fair share of tax. I do not doubt Professor Stewart's credentials at all and I will read his contribution with some interest. We have been through the different definitions and criteria used for assessing the effective rate of corporation tax. When Ireland's case is laid out, the rate is approximately 11.9%. The Deputy and Professor Stewart are using a different set of criteria in ending up with 2.2%.

If the product is sold in Italy, would the VAT be paid in Italy and where would the intellectual property be vested? How would the corporate rate apply in respect of that intellectual property? It may well be vested in the United States or some other country.

That is why Ireland wants to participate with the OECD in terms of the 15 sectors involved in bringing about an international response to this particular phenomenon. The Commission is dealing with a technicality in respect of a specific company. It is also taking in issues in Luxembourg and the Netherlands. We will defend our position very strongly as being statutorily based, ethically applied and not the equivalent of state aid. We will defend that position very strongly.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	The programme for Government has a section dealing with political reform and the Government indicates "we will legislate on the issue of cabinet confidentiality". The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 has a provision at section 86 precluding an Oireachtas committee from seeking evidence about Cabinet decisions and discussions. Some may say this is in accordance with Article 28 of the Constitution but section 71 of the Act, for some reason, also precludes questions being asked about Cabinet discussions. This is the Act used in setting up the banking inquiry. For some reason the Government specifically inserted a provision to prevent questions being asked about Cabinet discussions, which one might think is central to many of the issues, and to which many people would like to contribute. Was this intended in the programme for Government when it stated "we will legislate on the issue of cabinet confidentiality"? Will the Taoiseach outline what was meant by the inclusion of that provision in the programme for Government or why was it inserted?

He was not quite sure how it ended up in the programme for Government but it is there and it is a promise to legislate. When can we expect universal primary care legislation? With the discretionary medical card decision, there was a promise, even as late as today, that the 1970 health care legislation would be an issue. I do not agree with the Taoiseach's analysis as discretionary medical cards were being given out for 30 or 40 years anyway. Be that as it may, we have been told this only relates to undue hardship and legislation would be required to deal with medical issues in the granting of discretionary medical cards. That was promised but it was not promised in today's statement. Will the Taoiseach provide an update on the commitment to legislate for people having access to medical cards on the basis of medical hardship?

Mar atá a fhios ag an Taoiseach, dhá mhí ó shin mar fhreagra ar cheist a chur mé, dúirt an Taoiseach go raibh sé tiomanta de bhunú rún uilepháirtí ar an cheist seo. Gheall sé go raibh sé chun rún a dhréachtú agus a chur i láthair. Mar is eol don Taoiseach, dúirt Rúnaí Stáit na mBreataine, Theresa Villiers, nach raibh sí chun fiosrúcháin a bhunú maidir le marú 11 duine i mBaile Uí Mhurchú i 1971. Tá sé in am rún a thabhairt os comhair na Dála agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do na teaghlaigh. An tseachtain seo caite dúirt an Taoiseach arís go raibh sé ar intinn aige rún a fhoilsiú an tseachtain seo. Tuigim go mbeidh teaghlaigh Bhaile Uí Mhurchú i láthair sa Dáil don rún agus beidh an Taoiseach ag cur fáilte roimh na teaghlaigh. An féidir leis an Taoiseach níos mó eolas a thabhairt dom maidir leis seo?The programme for Government promised to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities and to allocate resources accordingly. In February of last year, the Government scrapped the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grants which were found not to comply with the Equal Status Act 2000 and the Disability Act 2005. The Ombudsman recommended that the scope of these schemes be widened and the criteria of the Equal Status Act 2000 be applied positively. Instead, however, the Government scrapped the schemes. The Government committed 16 months ago to legislate for a new scheme because now it is actively discriminating against citizens with disabilities. Where stands this commitment and where is the promised legislation?

Tabharfaidh mé isteach é an chéad seachtain eile agus cuirfidh mé eolas chuig an Teachta agus don Fhreasúra faoin rún i dtreo is go mbeidh cead ag muintir Bhaile Uí Mhurchú a bheith anseo i rith na díospóireachta. Tabharfaidh mé eolas don Teachta freisin maidir leis an am a bheidh an díospóireacht sa Dáil. Tá a fhios ag an Teachta go mbeidh mé ag bualadh leis agus leis an leas príomh-aire an tseachtain seo chugainn, sílim, ag 6.30 p.m. Beidh sé curtha os comhair cruinniú an Rialtais an tseachtain seo chugainn agus tabharfaidh mé eolas don Fhreasúra maidir leis an rún agus an t-am a bheidh ann don díospóireacht.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this most important issue for the constituency of Louth and east Meath. Earlier today, there were 32 people on trolleys at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. That figure, which represents an increase of 25 on yesterday's figure, is almost double what it was last Friday. These figures are recorded and monitored by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation. No other hospital in the country has as many people on trolleys today as Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. University Hospital Limerick was in second place with 22. Given that there are 210 patients on trolleys across the country as a whole, it is clear that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital accounts for one in seven patients on trolleys. The figures compiled by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation indicate that 1,855 people spent time on trolleys between January and April of this year. This compares with a figure of 1,397 for the same period in 2013. Last week, this House debated the overcrowding and the cramped conditions at University Hospital Limerick. I am pleased this week to have an opportunity to raise the very serious problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. We are continually receiving complaints from our constituents in counties Louth and Meath, and from people further afield, about the serious problems with accident and emergency facilities at the hospital. The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has mentioned the possibility of accident and emergency department closures this summer, as budgetary measures aimed at making savings in the general health area take effect. The association has warned that accident and emergency units will face a perfect storm if staffing meltdown is accompanied by the possibility of closures. This is extremely serious. I am glad the Minister for Health is present to respond to what I have to say. He is quite familiar with Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is just down the road from his own constituency in Fingal. I am sure a few of his constituents have had cause to use the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital. As he will be aware, the hospital's huge catchment area extends not only across counties Louth and Meath, but also to the north of County Dublin and the south of County Monaghan. Perhaps some people have to come from further afield to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. The reality is that the accident and emergency facilities at the hospital are overcrowded and the level of staff cover is seriously inadequate. I predict that a very serious crisis will arise at the hospital sooner or later when it proves impossible to admit patients to the hospital in emergency situations because an adequate level of staff to cater for their immediate needs is not available. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the busiest hospitals in the country. While people who ring my constituency office accept that the hospital is fine or excellent when they get into mainstream treatment there, they are concerned that it has become a huge challenge to get through the accident and emergency department. The whole concept of requiring people who are more than 80 years of age to lie on trolleys for ten or 12 hours at a time is simply unacceptable in this day and age. We all accept that savings and curtailments are necessary, but certain areas need to be prioritised in that context. I suggest that the area of accident and emergency should be a clear priority within the health service. People receive excellent care in the mainstream hospital service after they have finally overcome the huge challenge of coming through the accident and emergency unit. As I said earlier, I am pleased that the Minister is here to take this Topical Issue because he is quite familiar with the problems at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. I appeal to him to ask the HSE immediately to examine the adequacy of staff cover at the hospital. We know that measures are clearly needed to address this problem immediately.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I thank the Deputy. In common with many hospitals, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda has experienced an increase in attendances at its emergency department in the current year. For hospitals like Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital that serve populations with significant numbers of high acuity elderly patients presenting with complex co-morbidities, the requirement to admit patients is similarly high. The nature of these patients' needs may require longer than average lengths of stay. Patient experience times at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are roughly in line with national patient experience times. Approximately 70% of patients are discharged home or admitted within six hours. Some 81.4% of patients are discharged home or admitted within nine hours. Despite the increases I mentioned at the outset, the number of patients waiting for ward bed accommodation has decreased by 15.4% in the last three years. The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that it is unacceptable to have patients on trolleys for eight to ten hours. While I agree with him, he should acknowledge that such waiting times represent a huge improvement on the waiting times of three or four days that were experienced when he was in government. The special delivery unit has worked intensively with management and staff at the hospital. A variety of initiatives which address many of the needs of the local population have been introduced. A cross-sectoral group that will focus on frail and vulnerable elderly patients, with representatives from the community, private nursing homes, the acute sector and groups such as Alzheimer's disease carers, has been established. The HSE is seeking to expedite the recruitment of nurses, particularly for the emergency department and for critical care. Internal medicine services have been reconfigured to enable acute medicine assessment unit physicians to manage all acute medicine assessment unit and short-stay medical unit patients. An additional acute medicine physician has been recruited to further extend these services. Twice-weekly medical census meetings and once-weekly surgical and orthopaedic census meetings, led by the clinical director, have been introduced. At these meetings, an overview of each inpatient's care takes place and potential impediments to their discharge are discussed. Ten private nursing home beds have been purchased for the provision of orthopaedic rehabilitation following hip fractures. This service also utilises a physiotherapist. It has significantly reduced orthopaedic patients' length of stay at the hospital. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is making progress in implementing all elements of the emergency medicine programme. Practice changes and patient pathways that have been put in place for acute medicine remain very effective. A recent audit undertaken by the quality and patient safety audit validated the hospital's full compliance with the acute medicine programme. The overall length of stay in medicine, surgery and orthopaedics is well within the targets set nationally and by the clinical care programmes. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital recently got planning permission for the second phase of its planned expansion, which will provide an enlarged emergency department and 60 en suite single accommodation rooms which are fully compliant with the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland. The hospital is actively bringing NCHD rosters into compliance with the requirements of the European working time directive. Medical on-call rotas have been reduced from 24 hours to 12 hours. The hospital, supported by the special delivery unit, is continuing to actively seek improvements in the provision of patient care. Current priorities include the improvement of patient clinical pathways, the optimisation of the use of the acute medicine unit and the movement of patients to lower acuity beds at other facilities, such as Louth County Hospital, when his or her condition is sufficiently stable to do so.Consideration is also being given to nurse staffing of the day ward and transition lounge. Special delivery unit liaison officers continue to engage with the hospital on these operational issues, as a result of which I expect to see further improvements in access to appropriate care in a timely manner. The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive are focused on implementing the Government's reform programme for acute hospitals, including the organisation of these hospitals into a small number of groups, each with its own governance and management, to provide an optimum configuration for the delivery of high-quality, safe patient care in a cost effective manner.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	I find it very difficult to accept the Minister's assertion that patient experience timelines at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital are broadly in line with national timelines. That is not what I am hearing in my constituency office, where people are complaining about the extraordinary length of time they are spending on trolleys there. I am appealing to the Minister to give special attention to the hospital's accident and emergency unit to see whether he and his Department, working with the HSE, can improve patient waiting times and remove as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, from trolley accommodation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	366	I assure the Deputy that his desire is my desire. I do not want people spending any longer on trolleys than they must. I do not want to see the numbers of patients on trolleys increasing. We are moving to the use of patient experience times because those figures can highlight where people do have to wait prolonged periods on trolleys, which is unsatisfactory. The newly appointed director of hospitals at the HSE, Dr. Tony O'Connell, comes to us from Australia, where he worked in New South Wales and Queensland. In both instances, he made a huge impact in improving quality of care and waiting times for patients. I am meeting him and Mr. Tony O'Brien tomorrow. The Dublin north east hospitals group, which includes Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, will be part of the focus at that meeting. The Deputy may be aware that Dr. O'Connell was chief executive officer of the Dublin north east hospitals group before being promoted to director of hospitals. Everything will be done to improve the situation in Drogheda and identify the reasons for the increase in the numbers of patients on trolleys. The SDU has visited the hospital in the past and listened to suggestions from staff for service improvements, taking on board those which made immediate sense, asking for a better price on the provision of certain services and dismissing proposals that did not make any sense financially. That review encompassed such issues as community nursing facilities, home help provision, home care packages and even community intervention teams to deliver intravenous antibiotics to patients at home so they would not have to stay in hospital for long periods, thereby freeing up beds to allow for more admissions from the emergency department. I assure the Deputy and the people of Drogheda and the Dublin north-east region that everything will be done to ensure they have a safe, efficient and effective service and that patients do not spend any longer on trolleys than is absolutely essential.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I tabled this matter for discussion arising from a meeting I had last Thursday, together with my colleague, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, with two beautiful ladies who are multiple sclerosis sufferers and who were accompanied by Mr. Tom Curran, partner of the late Marie Fleming. The meeting was to discuss their concerns that the drug they are currently taking to alleviate the symptoms of MS, Fampyra, will no longer be available free of cost as a result of its manufacturer, Biogen, being refused access to the general medical services scheme by the Health Service Executive. Having tabled this matter for discussion yesterday, I learned this morning that Biogen has reapplied for inclusion in the GMS scheme, which is great news. I also welcome the indication last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, of his openness to a new application by Biogen and his acknowledgment of the serious impact the refusal of its application is having on some of the 8,000 MS sufferers in this country. People have experienced an incredibly positive impact on their condition from taking this drug and are now in fear that they will no longer have access to it in the coming weeks. Will the Minister give an assurance today that he will ask the HSE to fast-track Biogen's application for inclusion in the GMS scheme? In the meantime, it is my intention to ask the company publicly to continue to provide its product free of charge, for the duration of the application process, to the people on whom it is having such a positive impact. The two women I met last week - I am sure the Minister has heard similar testimony from other Deputies - spoke movingly of the impact the drug has had on their health. One of them is younger than me and has a young child. I have been unable to stop thinking of her description of being able, for the first time ever, to plait her daughter's hair. It can seem like a small and insignificant thing to people like me to be able to brush our children's hair every day and make their lunches, but to this woman it was an enormous achievement. Now she faces the prospect of once again being unable to do it because she cannot afford to pay for the drug. Moreover, without access to this medicine, she will be unable to work and will be entitled to a €785 per month disability benefit payment. She is young and full of vitality and wants to return to work. I am asking for the Minister's commitment that he will request the HSE to fast-track this process. In the period until that process is completed, I will ask the company to continue to provide the drug to those people who are already availing of it under the GMS scheme.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue which relates not only to the specific drug to which she referred but to a range of medicines. I understand the manufacturer of Fampyra - a brand name for fampridine - has indicated to the HSE that it intends to submit a revised application to include the drug under the community drugs schemes. The HSE will consider the application on receipt, in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines. The Deputy has indicated that the company submitted a revised application today. The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drugs schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The HSE has already considered an application for the inclusion of Fampyra in the GMS and community drugs schemes. This application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampyra and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate its cost effectiveness in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website. The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampyra under the community drugs schemes. I understand studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of the drug on both walking ability and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS. I acknowledge the Deputy's clear testament in this regard. The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of Fampyra, which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion on the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the community drugs schemes. In this context, it is open to the manufacturer at any time to submit a new application to the HSE for its product's inclusion. As we have heard, it did so this morning. I assure the Deputy that I, and the HSE, fully understand that patients are very anxious that this product be made available under the community drugs schemes. The HSE will consider the manufacturer's revised application in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines so that the matter is addressed and dealt with as quickly as possible.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	In its report, the NCPE stated that it had not managed to prove the cost effectiveness of the drug against the 8,000 patients using it. However, all 8,000 MS patients do not need to use it; it is applicable only to one third of them. Perhaps that message was lost in translation, in which case I hope it will be clearly heard in the new application process. The Minister indicated that the new application will be considered "in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines". Will he indicate what the standard timescale might be? Is there any way we can speed it up in this case given that the drug in question will no longer be available free of charge to patients from the end of June?That will have a serious impact. One of the ladies I met last week told me it is the difference between her making it to the bathroom and not making it. This has a really serious impact on these people's lives which is why I again call on Biogen to continue to fund these drugs for the people currently receiving them until this process between it and the HSE can be brought to a conclusion.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	Again, I thank the Deputy. I would like to make a few general points. The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish pharmaceutical sector are very important to this country, but we have a problem in that we have a very limited budget. We have just exited a bailout and the pressures of the health budget are well known. In the context of Fampyra, there are more than 7,000 people with multiple sclerosis, and at a cost of €6,000 each, it is €42 million per annum, which is an awful lot of money. For how many of these people will this drug be successful? I would like to see the pharmaceutical industry engage in risk sharing so that in situations where there is a drug which we can prove by way of a blood test, a biopsy or an independent clinical assessment of the activities of daily living, such as walking distances, that it really improves the situation for patients, we will pay for those patients. However, what about the two thirds or the four fifths of patients for whom it does not work? Are we to pay from them also? Where is the role of the industry in this? Why does it not join us in terms of sharing the risk and if it does not work, let us negotiate what we will pay for those, if anything at all? For a long time patients have looked to the Government to provide care and it is our duty to provide it, but I would like to appeal to patient groups to join the Government to ensure the new medicines which become available are made affordable for us to provide to our people and that the pharmaceutical industry engages in risk sharing in regard to these very expensive and sometimes hugely effective drugs that can have a life changing impact on people's daily activities which, as a doctor, I fully accept. However, I appeal to the pharmaceutical industry to engage with the health service in a way that these drugs become available at an affordable price for those who can avail of them and will benefit from them and that we look at some other way to deal with the high risk to the system for all those who use these drugs but do not get any benefit from them.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	371	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address this matter. I would like to start by quoting a letter I sent to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on 29 August 2013.Dear MinisterI wish to refer to gang slayings in the city. These are occurring with a regularity that now breeds acceptance. This is proof to the criminals who profit from these barbarous acts that it is their will alone that determines the limits to this behaviour.Paralleling the criminals' acceptance at these new norms that they have established to serve their own ends is an acceptance by civil society that a frightening new layer of brutality has become an integral part of contemporary urban life.Decent people are silently seething that their communities, which act as a backdrop to these shootings, are being redefined by criminal behaviour to an extent that civic pride and community wellbeing is being undermined.The government now must demonstrate that the will of the 99 per cent can prevail. Slaying at the whim of these criminals must be stopped. Limerick offers a glowing example of how the tide can be successfully turned.Deputy Dowds and I had a meeting with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, after that but there was no discernible outcome. The subject matter of this letter - gun crime - was brutally illustrated last Friday evening when a young child in Cherry Orchard was hit by gun fire. How ironic that any child should be in danger on his own doorstep. The very place where he should feel safest was attacked. A sanctuary was breached. Little Sean is still in hospital and, hopefully, he will soon be back home safe and well. Of course, we wish to send him our best wishes. Gun fire in the proximity of children is quite a frequent occurrence in the city. Recently when children were being dropped off at a crèche in Donaghmede gun fire erupted. This is a reckless practice which must be halted. I wish to refer to a linked matter, namely, to a fear people have that their area can be somehow defined by the occurrence of brutalising incidents such as that which happened in Cherry Orchard last Friday evening. In that regard, I would like to say a few words about Cherry Orchard. Some 30 years ago, when people first moved into this new estate, there were only houses. The streets, footpaths and street lighting were unfinished. It did not have shops, a school, a church, facilities, a bus service and playgrounds. Some 30 years later, through the efforts of residents, the area has been transformed and, with the assistance of Dublin City Council, there are splendid parks and very good playgrounds. It has one of the most pioneering schools in the country, St. Ultan's, a youth orchestra which regularly performs at the National Concert Hall and one of the country's leading amateur soccer clubs, which is regularly visited by scouts from English league clubs, is based there. All of this is the outcome of dedication, commitment and hard work by the people engaged in community building, the people of Cherry Orchard and the parish priest, Fr. O'Connor, over a 30 year period. Cherry Orchard needs the Minister's help. It needs more gardaí and more resources to counter some of the activities which have been referred to. I would like the Minister to consider visiting Cherry Orchard to meet the people, which they would like, and to talk directly to them and discuss how serious outstanding issues can be tackled by them with her support.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	372	I thank Deputies Conaghan and Ó Snodaigh for raising this important matter. I would like to record my outrage at the appalling incident last Friday where a young child was shot at Croftwood Gardens, Ballyfermot. As the Deputies know, a major Garda investigation is under way. I spoke to the acting Garda Commissioner about this incident when I met her yesterday and she assured me progress is being made with all necessary resources deployed. An Garda Síochána is determined to bring to justice those involved and I know it has the full support of the local community in identifying the perpetrators. Clearly, anyone who has information which could be helpful to the Garda should pass this on immediately. I am further advised that a Garda liaison officer has been appointed to assist the family and that an incident room has been established in Ballyfermot Garda station to investigate this incident which is being overseen by a senior investigating officer. As the Deputy rightly said, gun crime represents a real challenge for policing and poses significant potential for harm in the community, in this case, unfortunately, in the form of very serious injuries to a young child.Garda strategy for tackling gun crime involves targeted and intelligence-based operations, often disrupting and preventing incidents before harm is caused, as well as detecting and prosecuting those involved. Much of this work goes unheralded but it is carried out with great determination by the men and women of An Garda Síochána, who can themselves face great risk in taking on armed criminals. The robust Garda response to violent crime has led to firearms offences decreasing last year by 7%, and the number of crime incidents in which a firearm was involved was also down, by more than 7%. However, I accept all the points made by Deputy Conaghan on the horrific nature of the incident. The precise deployment of resources is a matter for the Acting Garda Commissioner. I have discussed the policing situation in Ballyfermot in general terms with her and been assured that the Garda is working with the community and providing the best possible support on the ground. I am informed that at present there are 198 gardaí in the Clondalkin-Ballyfermot district. The sale and possession of legally held firearms in this jurisdiction is highly regulated. However, my Department is currently conducting a review of firearms legislation after which I will engage in broader consultations ahead of preparing any legislative changes arising from the review. Ahead of completion of the review, I would point out that our criminal law already rightly provides heavy penalties for weapons offences and mandatory minimum penalties are in place for certain firearms offences. The Garda also has considerable powers available to it in tackling serious and armed crime, and they have been supplemented further by the recent DNA database legislation which has just been passed in both Houses. The Bill was completed last week in the Seanad. When established, the DNA database will have the capacity to link suspects to unsolved crimes using forensic evidence, and will greatly assist the Garda in investigating crime. The acting Garda Commissioner is aware that if she believes other legislative measures or steps would assist in tackling armed and serious crime they will be given the most serious consideration by me. I take serious note of the views expressed by the Deputy during the debate. Our thoughts are with the family of the young victim of this shooting. We are concerned with the well-being of the family during this very difficult period and look forward to the recovery of the victim. I visited St. Ultan's in the past. I am very struck by the range of initiatives and work that, as Deputy Conaghan, rightly pointed out, has been done by the community of Cherry Orchard in the past 30 years and the significant community work in which everyone engages. Deputy Conaghan is familiar with the work the Garda is doing with local youth groups. The local youth diversion programme has proved very successful. There are also two major Garda operations in the area: Operation Hybrid and Operation Domino, which are both designed to provide a proactive response to organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region.

I am aware she has direct experience of visiting the area and has visited the school. People come from all over the country because of the innovations in the school and its comprehensive curriculum and orchestra. It is the one place in the city where children go to school with a schoolbag in one hand and a violin case in the other. Would the Minister consider meeting a small group of residents for an exchange of views? It would give her an insight into how strong the feeling is about the dreadful matter that took place. I accept the Minister has a very busy schedule but perhaps she would consider it.

It would be important to meet with the community. I understand that for a community which has taken such proactive steps itself to build itself up how very disturbing what happened on Friday night is and how concerned people are about what took place. I spoke to Fr. Gerry today and I know the community is rallying around. I am satisfied from my discussion with the acting Garda Commissioner that everything possible will be done by the Garda to support the community and to follow up and make sure that justice is seen to be done in response to the crime.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	Today is the 55th day of the mass hunger strike of Palestinian administrative detainees in Israeli prisons protesting against their ill treatment and internment without trial or charge. Their conditions are deteriorating daily. Approximately 80 hunger strikers have been hospitalised and many are in grave danger of losing their lives. The Israeli state is now trying to pass legislation that will allow the force-feeding of the strikers which prisoners have labelled a form of torture. Amnesty International and other groups around the world have said the same. The latest update I received some minutes ago from Palestine is that the Bill has passed the second and third reading in the Knesset and may very well be introduced into law by Monday. It is the longest mass hunger strike among prisoners in Palestinian history and the hunger strikers remain steadfast in their demands to end the policy of administrative detention. I ask the Minister to condemn Israel’s widespread use of administrative detention which is in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention which states that internment can be used "only if security of the detaining power makes it absolutely necessary". Amnesty International has called Israel’s administrative detention arbitrary detention that fails to fulfil the international criteria for a just trial, and inhumane and degrading and it notes that Israel uses it to suppress the legitimate and peaceful activities of activists. I have been informed that the 80 detainees who have now been taken to hospital had intrusive body searches. The cells in which they were kept were below basic standards. I believe those who have been taken to hospital have been shackled hand and foot to their beds. That is an outrage and an appalling human tragedy. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, has constantly spoken on the inhuman treatment of the Palestinian people in general. Israel appears to listen to no one. As of 2008, Israel was in violation of 30 UN Security Council resolutions and 60 UN resolutions. The manner in which Israel treats the Palestinians would not be tolerated from any other state in the world. It is appalling and unacceptable. Given this country’s record in condemning human rights violations around the world, the time has come for us to call in the Israeli ambassador and make it clear to him that we will not accept people, some as young as 17 years of age, being arrested without charge, interned without charge and tortured. Prisoners have a right not to accept food under protest yet the state has gone so far as to commence the introduction of a law to force-feed the detainees. Ireland is a country that has always stood up for human rights around the world and condemned the Israelis. It is not good enough to simply show our concern, as some have suggested. We must express our condemnation.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I thank Deputy Halligan for raising this issue which I am taking on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore. The Government has consistently made clear its concerns about the use of administrative detention by the Israeli authorities. This is a practice which Israel has resorted to for many years and the numbers so detained have fluctuated according to the prevailing security situation on the ground. Some 190 Palestinians are held in administrative detention. The hunger strikes by Palestinian prisoners which began on 24 April were directly prompted by what the prisoners claim was Israel's failure to make progress in reconsidering the use of administrative detention, particularly following the conclusion of the last Palestinian hunger strikes in 2012. Israel is undeniably faced with serious security challenges and therefore may have recourse legitimately in exceptional circumstances to special powers. However, there are clear grounds for concern that administrative detention is being used in some cases to suppress legitimate dissent and protest. The instances of repeated extensions of detention orders can also mean individuals may be detained for prolonged periods, even several years, without ever having charges laid against them. The use of intelligence material as sole evidence for the decisions by military tribunals can result in denial of access to prosecution evidence to the detainees and their legal representatives. Any system in which a person can be imprisoned for years with no means to challenge the basis of their detention is clearly unacceptable. Ireland has repeatedly drawn attention to these concerns with administrative detention both directly with the Israeli authorities and in discussions at EU or UN level, including in the UN Human Rights Council last March where our national statement under item No. 7 made clear our long-standing concerns about this practice. Ireland has also raised this issue in EU discussions on the Middle East and ensured the EU also has explicitly criticised on several occasions in recent years, the excessive use by Israel of administrative detention. There has been a significant reduction in the use of the practice by Israel in recent years but the problem remains a serious one. We will continue to make known our concerns about the practice overall to the Israeli authorities at all appropriate opportunities. There have been repeated protests by Palestinian detainees in recent years over the use of administrative detention. In common with our EU partners, we have encouraged the parties to engage in negotiations which address the legitimate complaints of the detainees and to avoid any provocative actions which would risk the health or life of the detainees. Our missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah remain in contact with civil society groups dealing with prisoners' rights, including the issues of administrative detention and hunger strikes, as well as working with our international partners to support progress on these very difficult issues. The use of hunger strikes is a very dangerous tactic which we cannot encourage. It is notable the Israeli authorities have responded to recent hunger strikes in a manner to avoid the death of any prisoner. They are clearly alert to this danger but there must always be a very strong risk, particularly with repeated hunger strikes, that the authorities will eventually conclude that they must make a stand, and refuse to compromise further. This is perhaps a particular danger at this moment when the Israeli Government and public are, understandably, strongly focused on the abduction of three teenagers who are still missing and whose safe return we all hope for. It is the case that a draft Bill to permit the force feeding of hunger strikers has been submitted to the Israeli Knesset. However, no final decision on its approval has yet been taken by the Knesset. The Israeli Medical Association has declared, as have several human rights groups, that force-feeding is in breach of medical ethical standards. There is some expectation that any possible new law might be challenged in the Israeli courts on the grounds of its constitutionality. We would strongly urge the Israeli authorities to refrain from the force-feeding of hunger strikers in the event of parliamentary approval of this proposed law.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	I welcome the Minister’s comprehensive response to this serious issue. It is appropriate there are several former Israeli soldiers, Breaking the Silence, in Dublin today who gave a presentation as to how they were forced to treat Palestinians and violate their human rights. Ireland never stands idly by and always opposes the violation of human rights. The chances of Israel paying any attention to us, however, are remote when it is already in breach of over 90 UN and UN Security Council resolutions. It is important, none the less, that we make it known to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland and the Israeli Government that we will not tolerate the force-feeding of hunger strikers and the detention of individuals without charge. From the information I received today, I note some of those hunger strikers, even though they are critically ill, are being constantly asked to eat. When they refuse, their guards eat the food in front of them. It is appalling what is happening in these hospitals in Israel. I condemn the recent abduction of three Israeli students and hope they are returned safely. I condemn all violence from all sides. The history of violence against Palestinians by Israeli forces has been well-documented by various Ministers for Foreign Affairs, from Deputy Martin to Deputy Gilmore and others. I am happy the Minister of State, in her response, condemned what Israel is doing. However, we need to be steadfast in our support of human rights. People have a right to protest without being arrested, shackled to their beds and being force-fed. If the legislation in question is passed in the Knesset, it should be condemned.

I will bring Deputy Halligan’s views to the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, although he is well aware of them. Ireland will use every opportunity to address this issue.

Should a local authority be unable to inspect a housing assistance payment property before agreeing a tenancy, it will be required to do so not less than two months after the agreement. Rental accommodation standards have dropped significantly over time. Dublin City Council inspections of accommodation found that well over 90% of inner city flats failed to reach basic standards. HAP should not support landlords who are renting substandard accommodation. It might not always be possible to inspect prior to agreeing a tenancy but it should be done as soon as possible. Two months is a fair timescale for that.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	The purpose of prescribing the appropriate period in regulation as opposed to primary legislation is to allow, if needed for flexibility, an opportunity to change the period set if it becomes impractical. I am not against the idea of setting a timescale but it is more practical to put it into regulations because it is then easier to change if required. While I accept the principle of the Deputy’s proposal is to ensure minimum disruption or confusion for the household concerned, this must be balanced against the practicality for the housing authority. The period that will be prescribed under this section will be set in consultation with housing authorities and can be the subject of review once the scheme is operational to ensure the correct balance has been struck between consideration of the HAP recipient and the housing authority’s practical requirements. Prescribing the period as suggested by the Deputy would also make it more difficult to follow through on the outcome of any review for the period set. I am not against the amendment's principle but it would be more practical to deal with it through regulation. We will have a trial period with the first seven local authorities and we want to learn from this. This is why I do not want to put it into the legislation.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	I understand what the Minister of State has said, but our experience of dealing with landlords is that these issues tend to drag on and we seem to wait indefinitely for places to be inspected and approved. We saw what happened in the inner city with regard to standards. In the surveys conducted the standards were very low. We need to be more precise about how long we should allow. From this point of view I will press the amendment.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	I have spoken to Kildare County Council about a number of elements of this and I understand it can take up to eight months for an inspection to take place. I do not dispute that a reasonable amount of time should be made available, but there should be a proviso that it is as early as possible. Will environmental health officers be available to conduct the inspections if the number of people envisaged by the Minister of State sign up for HAP? I must say I doubt the number will materialise but this is another matter. Staffing will be an issue. The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, had quite rigorous housing assessment and included matters one would expect, such as having a fire blanket and attending to any small amount of dampness before a house entered the scheme. In this case people will already be in the houses. The legislation provides that payment can continue and if the property fails the people will have to find alternative accommodation. This will be one of the biggest problems. In an environment where we have a shortage of housing supply people who have settled in a house which does not meet the standards will have to go on the trail to find alternative accommodation. This and the staffing ratio are significant issues and I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say on them.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	Deputy Murphy has raised the issue of staffing on a number of occasions and we are certainly aware of it. We want to ensure people are not held up and can get into accommodation. We are speaking about people on rent supplement at present. I acknowledge the inspection system is not as good as it should be. In the system in Dublin, to which Deputy Ellis referred, there was a particularly targeted inspection in a particular part of the city and the reason so many of the accommodation units failed was because it was targeted to an area with a need for inspection to ensure standards were correct. We need to improve constantly the situation with regard to standards and inspections and ensure everybody, no matter what type of housing they are in, is in accommodation suitable to their needs. We are trying to be practical and learn from the trial period with the seven local authorities which will be the first into HAP. We will examine in particular the capacity of local authorities and their ability to carry out these inspections. We will examine all of this as part of the trial period.

It is fair to say all properties should be registered with the PRTB and it certainly should be the case when a local authority is dealing with a landlord. There should be standards. The amendment also states the PRTB should be notified of prospective HAP tenants, and if the landlord is unregistered and seeking to register the tenancies at the time he or she should be considered for the HAP scheme. It is a simple request to include the amendment because it will give the PRTB powers to deal with this issue. We need to strengthen it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	391	I have no problem with the principle of what Deputy Ellis is trying to do, but it replicates a provision under section 134 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which requires the landlord of a dwelling to apply to the PRTB to register the tenancy of any dwelling. It is the statutory function of the PRTB under section 144 of the Act to ensure tenancies in the private rented sector are properly registered. Because HAP tenancies will be governed by the Residential Tenancies Act these requirements will also apply to HAP tenancies. Rather than replicate an existing provision, under section 55 I have provided for a specific provision for the exchange of information between housing authorities and the PRTB as a named specified person under the section for the purpose of enabling both to carry out their statutory functions. In this context I expect housing authorities to provide periodically to the PRTB a list of properties in respect of which HAP payments are being made so it can ensure these tenancies are appropriately registered and allow it fulfil its statutory function where the tenancies have not been registered. There has already been some improvement in data sharing between the Department of Social Protection and the PRTB under the current system, but the intention is that under section 55 data sharing will happen between the PRTB and the local authority concerned. While I agree with what Deputy Ellis is trying to achieve it already exists.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	I am conscious that while one property owned by a landlord may be considered for HAP that landlord may have other properties which are not registered.It is important to have consistency with regard to whatever landlord is there and that he or she is not operating differently elsewhere. That is the purpose of this amendment, which seeks to include the provision that "proof that any other dwellings under the ownership of said landlord which are occupied by a private tenant or other household within Housing Assistance Scheme have their tenancy registered with the Residential Tenancies Board". It is reasonable to make this request because so doing will cut out a lot of the messing that has been evident in the past whereby some landlords have had other properties and have operated them differently. I believe this provision might stop this.

Consequently, landlords have this legal requirement and data sharing now is getting rid of what the Deputy described as the messing, that is, when landlords do not register. It is through data sharing that the Government will be able to achieve this objective.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	396	I move amendment No. 33:In page 54, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:“(e) The Minister shall review the maximum amount of rent referred to in paragraph (b) every three months in each municipal district as defined under Part 3A of the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended), and, where evidence compiled indicates that less than 10 per cent of available rental accommodation units may be accessed by an individual or a family receiving a payment under this Part, shall initiate a review of the effectiveness of the present maximum amount of rent for that area.”.While there will not always be a shortage of supply, this definitely is the case at present, which if anything, demonstrates the need for this provision. Essentially, the legislation limits the amount from the Exchequer on an annual basis and a dangerous lack of flexibility in this regard is evident at present. This provision seeks a much more flexible arrangement whereby the local authorities will consider the limits every three months and in the case of less than 10% of available rental accommodation being accessible, there must be intervention or a relaxation of the rent caps. I do not know whether the Minister of State does this but I find myself accessing daft.ie three or four times a week to ascertain whether anything is available for individuals within the rent caps and invariably, I find there is not. I understand this legislation pertains to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and not the rent supplement scheme but it is being governed by the same type of caps. Consequently, one can expect the same situation will arise. One then is informed there will be a review, which will be undertaken every 18 months. However, that is not all that helpful to someone who has a problem now and is at risk of becoming, or in many cases has become, homeless. This amendment attempts to introduce a level of flexibility and in this context, I looked at the Labour Party's local election manifesto which states: "We will seek the urgent return [of] flexibility at ... local level in terms of rent caps to tackle displacement and allow discretion to be applied by Community Welfare Officers." The Minister for Social Protection, who is a member of the Labour Party, has responsibility in this regard and this is in that party's manifesto. All I seek is for such flexibility to be applied to the legislation, which would be in keeping with the Labour Party view according to this manifesto. I believe this must be done if one is to avoid the extremely rigid application of something that evidently is posing so many problems at present.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	397	One issue is that the State will continue to have a substantial proportion of the rented properties, estimated at approximately 33%, whether through HAP or through long-term rent supplement. However, the main focus of any rental limit review process must be to ensure that pricing of maximum rental limits does not distort the market, while at the same time providing opportunities for tenants to acquire accommodation. Its purpose is to get that balance right. Due care must be taken that pricing be established by natural supply and demand conditions, as opposed to by reference to the State's intervention, in order to avoid setting maximum rental limits that could force families, especially those on low incomes, into competing with pricing floors they cannot afford. The current policy for maximum rental limits within the rent supplement scheme is an 18 month cycle. The timing of 18 months represents a balance between the rental arrangements of tenants, as tenancy agreements normally are for approximately one year, and the need to ensure sufficient reviews to keep apace of the market. A shorter period to review maximum rental limits, for example, quarterly, would place a significant degree of ongoing pressure to change rental agreements mid-agreement on tenants and landlords alike. The cycle of how long the agreement lasts is part of the consideration. In addition, rents fall as well as rise - this might be a lovely dream at this point in time - but in declining markets, tenants would be forced to consider alternative accommodation as landlords continued to seek previous rents agreed. It must be remembered that rents can increase as well as decrease and reviewing maximum rental limits on a quarterly basis would not allow the market any time to adjust naturally to the imposition of new limits, therefore distorting the natural market rent level. I suppose this is a judgment call in terms of not intervening too often and not having what are now called caps affect or distort the market unduly - if there still are caps in respect of HAP - and to take account of the fact that were they to be reviewed regularly, this would happen in a time of declining rents, as well as a time of increasing rents.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	The fact that 33% of rental properties involve people who basically should have social housing is a scandal in its own right. I accept there is a legacy issue in this regard but it appears to me as though 18 months is extremely rigid. The difficulty is not with people who are in houses but affects those who cannot get them and cannot get a landlord to lease a house to them, even for a short duration. This is the upshot of the problem. The fact that Members are talking about the market really is what I have been saying - I hope the Minister of State has heard me - that people are being abandoned to the market, as that will be the only option available to them. It is not a home but is somebody else's property. Has a business case been conducted on the amount of money that will expended by the State on rental properties into the foreseeable future and on what would be the return, were there to be a major programme of building, even in the context of mixed development in which there were properties for sale as well as homes to let?I do not think the State's or taxpayers' involvement will be sustainable. It is a big social experiment and in the absence of major housing construction which would provide alternatives, it has big question marks over it.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	399	I agree with much of what the Deputy argues in that I do not want an escalation to continue because the proportion of people who rent in the private sector has been escalating over a good number of years and the number of people on rent support is a very large part of the total number of people who rent in the private sector. Nobody of the Deputy's political persuasion or mine would see this as an ideal situation by any means. I have said it many times that we do not have the cash at the moment to provide housing in any large numbers through the voluntary sector or the local authorities. Therefore, we have to modify the current system in the best way possible in the interests of tenants. That is the reason we are moving it into the social housing space and to the local authorities and introducing other reforms such as getting rid of the poverty traps. There is a business case being made for this area. We want to learn from the seven local authorities that will be moving into HAP initially. A considerable amount of work has been done on the business case. The Deputy is correct that ideally, if we could supply social housing in a different way rather than using private landlords, we would want to do so but we cannot do so in any great numbers at present. We have to operate within the context of the current situation. We have to use this system as best as possible in the interests of tenants.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	I support the amendment because the 18-month review is too long and it does not allow for an intervention from the State in a developing crisis of supply of rented accommodation now or over the next two to three years. As the Minister said, it is hoped this Government will be able to turn the situation around. I do not believe it is doing it fast enough and where there is a will, there is a way. We have a crisis, the Government's programme is not working and nor is its strategy because there will still be thousands of people depending on private rented accommodation who have no access to social housing. If the Minister of State believes that time is needed in order to allow for a review or for market prices to rise or fall, there should be a mechanism in the legislation to allow the State to intervene at any time to deal with a developing crisis, and to intervene before 18 months to deal with the price of rented accommodation.

The PRTB legislation provides for a tenancy agreement or a lease with a landlord whereby rents can only increase by market rates, but market rents are rising very fast. I refer to the option of a European type of system which could be of assistance and it is being examined.

Like the Minister of State, I would prefer rent controls because the sector could be more adequately served. We need a housing policy that guarantees everyone access to a home and not a case of whether the markets can build so many houses or apartments over five years or whether the State can find the money to build housing. I would welcome a discussion on rent controls so that they could be introduced quite quickly.

If we were to move to the continental model whereby so many people live indefinitely in rented accommodation, we could only make that move if we had a situation in which there was some form of effective rent control. I wonder if the Minister of State has had any engagement with the Minister for Finance on that particular matter because I can imagine he would be more than a little agitated by virtue of any proposal coming forward to effect rent control because of the inevitable consequences this would have in the buy-to-let market which is experiencing significant problems at present. However, it is an issue that needs to be considered. The principle set out in Deputy Murphy's amendment is very valid and I support it. Perhaps it is a little prescriptive in setting out three months as a period of time. I refer to the Minister of State's actions in including the 18 month period in the Bill but also her actions in recent times in addressing the inordinate problems within the Dublin local authority areas. Unfortunately, the problems with the caps are spreading out into County Kildare and many areas around Dublin. This issue of review is a pertinent one. When one further considers that the consequences of not having a review for the people who are affected currently is homelessness or the threat of homelessness, then manifestly there is a need to have a greater degree of flexibility, as set out by Deputy Murphy, than what is envisaged in the Minister of State's legislation. For that reason, I appeal to the Minister of State to look at the principles involved and to see what can be done.

The issue of flexibility was launched today in the four Dublin regional authorities. It is not in place in all regions but we need to move towards having it in place in the rest of the country. Having flexibility in cases where people are at risk of homelessness seems to me to be a very sensible approach to the whole issue of rent caps. It does not make sense to have people in hotels instead of being able to stay where they are and have the flexibility of the rent cap. The problem with raising or lowering rent caps, as the case may be, on a three-monthly basis is that one is influencing the market - I am sorry to call it a market but that is what it is essentially - in so far as there is a danger that landlords will simply increase the prices as they are unlikely to decrease the prices. Even where there is an agreement between the landlord and tenant for a year, for example, a three-monthly review would interfere with that process.

This varies between local authorities. Some local authorities state one offer and if one refuses the next offer, one waits a year or whatever. Other local authorities have different procedures. An offer could be made to someone in a place to which they cannot or do not want to go. It may be for reasons of anti-social behaviour. There may be a myriad of reasons they do not want to go to a specific area. The purpose of this amendment is to give a little flexibility to tenants if they refuse. Some parents have their children in schools in different areas and the next minute they are told they must move a long distance away. It is not fair. The offers must be reasonable and there also must be a certain number of them, of course within reason. In this regard, there is a need for greater standardisation because the process is so chaotic throughout the country.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	410	There are a variety of processes rather than tenants understanding what the rules might be and fairness. For example, a young woman I am dealing with who is homeless had a baby about a month ago. She cannot register the baby because she has no address. She has a four year old in school in north Kildare. It was suggested to her that there was rented accommodation in Monasterevin, which would be an hour away, that she should go and see which would be suitable to meet her housing need. That young woman has family support around her in north Kildare. Is such either-or practice the kind we will see? If so, there will be difficulties. It is different if it is local authority stock as opposed to what is available in the market. One could see tenants settling for very short durations, for example, for a year in one place, and moving children around the place constantly. There must be some thought for the likely longer-term impact, particularly on children or those who are vulnerable and require the support of family and friends around them.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	Even before the introduction of the housing assistance payment scheme, there was often a significant problem where tenants sought transfers or were made offers where those offers were felt to be completely unworkable from the point of view of the tenant but were deemed to be acceptable by the local authority, particularly where matters to do with proximity to school for children or proximity to supports, such as family or local community, were an issue but were not considered by the local authority as reasonable grounds to refuse an offer when they should have been. In my experience, it is quite common that tenants would be offered accommodation which, from their point of view, is in far-flung areas away out of the area in which they are normally used to living, where their children go to school or where they have support networks. That problem, if it existed previously, will be massively compounded by what the Minister of State is talking about with the housing assistance programme. It is already starting to happen. Where landlords who are in arrangements with the local authority through the HAP scheme decide, as they undoubtedly will on a regular basis, to pull out of those arrangements for whatever reason, the local authority will be overwhelmed with tenants to whom it has an obligation but who it simply has no means to house. The local authorities do not have the local authority housing stock and they do not have other private landlords with whom they will be able to house tenants. This will increase the pressure on the local authorities to push tenants into accepting accommodation which they should not have to accept and then if the tenants do not accept it, they will be penalised. What Deputy Ellis proposes is the minimum safeguard that tenants could expect in order that they have some flexibility and room to manoeuvre to refuse certain offers if they have reasonable grounds for doing so.

Secondly, under the current regulations it is two refusals, not one. I know the Deputy is proposing three but it currently provides for two refusals and it is in the householder's area of choice. The purpose of prescribing the appropriate period in regulations, as opposed to primary legislation, is to allow for flexibility to change should that become appropriate. It can be changed under the current system, which is by way of regulation, rather than putting it into primary legislation. I favour that because it allows us to change it if necessary. As I said, at the moment it is two refusals and it has to meet the household's needs.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	I hear what the Minister of State is saying but she has not agreed to one amendment in this process. It is reasonable to standardise the system. Having two offers is inconsistent because people are being offered places in areas where others have refused them. On occasion, the same house is being offered four or five times, which does not make sense. Some local authorities are taking a different view from that of the Minister of State and, unfortunately, they are not being reasonable about it. I wish they were but the problem is that they are not. We are seeking to have a standard which can be abided by throughout the country. In my experience, it is not true to say that every local authority is abiding by the current system and that there are two offers.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	418	The Minister of State says that people have to be housed in their area of choice, but the problem is that local authority areas are often very big. The Dún Laoghaire-Dalkey list covers a very large area. One end of it could be far away from where children go to school at the other end. While the local authority might say it is in a person's area of choice, in reality it is not practical as it involves significant upheaval for a family with children. If children are attending school far away or if elderly relatives are unwell, those are additional problems. It is reasonable to request three offers to give people room for manoeuvre. The Minister of State says she is open to considering some of the points being made here, so the issue of proximity to school should be explicitly included in any criteria.

In addition, there should be access to family support networks for elderly, disabled or ill people. Those criteria should be written into the legislation so that a local authority would have to consider them in deciding what is a reasonable offer. Housing departments will sometimes take such matters into consideration but they are under massive pressure to offer something, however inappropriate. If those criteria were written into the Bill, it would provide some protection to tenants.

If a person is offered a house within those communities and turns it down, that is one refusal. There are various reasons people might turn down an offer of housing. Their circumstances might change. For instance, a spouse or partner may have suffered ill health in the past six to 12 months. I have come across a case where somebody had a heart attack and turned down a housing offer because the property was on a hill with no bus service. They may return to the city council and change their area of preference but that is still deemed as one refusal on their record. When another offer is made they are left in a dilemma either to accept or have no hope of being rehoused. Two offers is therefore very limited. On the second offer, regardless of what type of property is being offered, the person must choose either to accept it or, in the case of Cork City Council, become ineligible for consideration for housing for up to two years. Under the old scheme, the welfare officer was also informed if a person was in receipt of rent allowance. There are major issues involved. In Cork City Council the refusal rate for housing is running at 40%. People are not being offered suitable accommodation because the local authority does not have any such accommodation to meet people's needs. Half of Cork City Council's housing list comprises single people, men and women, who rarely receive offers of housing. When they do, it usually in substandard accommodation even by local authority standards. They have no choice but to refuse those offers. It is not because they do want to be housed but because the area is not suitable to meet their needs.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	424	I support Deputy Ellis. Sometimes what somebody considers to be a reasonable offer may not be reasonable. A person may be offered a house on top of a hill but may have to refuse it due to ill health. There is nothing to stop the local authority offering the same person a second house in the same hill-top estate. I have known that to happen. It would be considered a person's second refusal and their rent allowance will be cut off. I have come across examples where a person's ex-husband or partner may live a few doors away from where they are offered a house. If they appeal against the refusal, it is considered to be a valid refusal. The definition of "reasonable offer" comes down to the individual. It should be standardised because it is not always as it seems. Much of the time, people may refuse houses for valid reasons, but officials sitting behind desks do not see it that way.

My Department does not tell Cork City Council that it has to have these particular three areas from which a choice must be made. That is not defined by my Department, it is decided at local level. We are seeking more local autonomy in many respects, so that certainly needs to be addressed at local rather than national level. If 40% of houses offered in Cork are refused, then three refusals is not enough. One would need five or six refusals to deal with that. Alternatively, one will have to change the areas of choice or have better estate management. There are many such matters that concern local authorities, as I see it. Would the Deputy pick three and put it into law, or leave it with regulation whereby one can vary it? However, there certainly is a challenge to local authorities as regards the discussion we have just had. They do make their scheme of letting priorities from time to time.There are opportunities at local level to address all of these issues but prescribing in law the exact number of refusals does not appear to me to be the way to resolve the legitimate issues that Deputies have identified. The house must, for example, meet the applicant's housing needs. That argument will have to be made at local authority level if the house does not suit the applicant's housing needs. I am not accepting the amendment because it is too rigid in providing for three refusals which cannot be varied by way of regulation. The issues raised by the Deputies are ones that local authorities need to address.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	428	Surely the Minister of State needs to instruct local authorities. I ask her to define "reasonable offer". That definition will vary among the various local authorities and housing officers. I am sure what is defined as a reasonable offer in Deputy Boyd Barrett's local authority is different from how it is defined by Cork City Council. It is grand to say it is up to local authorities to define areas of choice but surely it is the responsibility of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to define what is a reasonable offer or a reasonable refusal. There is no uniformity across local authorities in that regard. Between Cork County Council and Cork City Council there is a difference in what is deemed as a valid refusal. A valid refusal in one local authority is not deemed valid in the neighbouring authority. That issue needs to be addressed by the Minister of State.

That is what Deputy Ellis has done with his amendment, which provides for not less than three refusals. The Minister of State has accepted that circumstances arise in which certain local authorities are giving less than three options. What is wrong with amending the legislation to include "not less than three"? Like other speakers, I am growing concerned by the Minister of State's refusal to accept any amendment. One wonders whether we are engaged in a process of futility. A strong case has been made and the amendment stands on its merits. We are referring to reasonable offers. We all share the experiences that previous speakers have outlined. There are also unreasonable refusals and we need to take action in that regard. I recall a case in which a lady told me she was not taking up the offer of a local authority house because the garden was not big enough for her trampoline. While we have to stand up in such cases to say that the response is not on, Deputy Ellis made a reasonable proposal and I appeal to the Minister of State to have regard for it.

We need to put some sort of standard in place. A standard of three refusals across the board will not prevent flexibility. Currently, when the third refusal occurs, an individual will wait one year on the list. That is the penalty currently imposed in some, but not all, local authorities.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	433	I move amendment No. 35:In page 62, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:“52. (1) The Minister shall, six months after the coming into operation of this Part, cause a review to be conducted which shall assess the effectiveness of the measures contained in this Part under the following categories:(a) the net effect on the numbers of families waiting for accommodation to be provided to them by a housing authority in each local authority area;(b) the net number of individuals and families who are on the emergency accommodation waiting lists in their respective areas;(c) the number of local authority staff required by each housing authority for the optimal administration of the measures under this Part;(d) the funding required from the Central Fund or the local government fund for the optimal delivery of the measures under this Part.(2) The Minister shall compile the data and analysis undertaken under subsection (1) into a report which shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and transmitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, or its successor Committee.”.This is quite a big experiment. I completely take the point that the finances available to the State are limited but there is scope to leverage funding from other sources, including pensions and the European Investment Bank. Some of that could be at arm's length from local authorities and some of it may take in housing associations. In its absence all that will be available is the housing assistance payment, HAP, and reliance on the market to deliver housing for those on waiting lists. I know the Minister of State plans to do a pilot with seven local authorities. The issue arises then of how to monitor its effectiveness, for example, how many are in emergency accommodation and the funds available. This amendment is intended to give an opportunity for us to come back here, perhaps annually, to monitor this social experiment. It is the biggest change in social housing perhaps since the foundation of the State. Increasing numbers people will qualify to go on housing lists because the more their incomes are driven down, through taxes and charges, the less they will be able to purchase houses, even in favourable circumstances where mortgages are available for those on low incomes. It will be essential to monitor this experiment to ensure it is not allowed continue if it is seen to fail. We have not seen the results of the Limerick city pilot. I know that one of the seven other pilots will involve a large city authority which should give some sense of the difference between large and small authorities. There should be ongoing monitoring. The Government is undertaking large regeneration schemes where there were failures in housing policy, but we should not allow this to continue if it is seen not to be the solution to the housing problem. I do not believe it will solve the problem.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	434	Some of us believe that this Bill will turn a housing disaster into a complete catastrophe for social housing and homelessness. The Minister of State obviously disputes that and believes it is workable. I do not see how it can be workable, when all the evidence points in the opposite direction, to move towards reliance on private landlords who are jacking up rents and running away from arrangements with local authorities and who have made it clear they have no interest in housing people on low incomes. It will compound a disastrous situation in ways that will become manifest very quickly. I hope the real review will come from people on the housing lists clamouring at politicians’ clinics, outside local authority offices and outside this building, demanding an immediate reversal of this policy. Time will tell quite quickly. The very least the Government could do is accept this amendment from those of us who are deeply alarmed by what it is doing, and agree to review this scheme every few months, monitor it closely and let us have all the details about what is happening in the different categories of housing need in order that we can assess what is going on. It will be very telling and damning. The Minister of State would obviously argue otherwise, but if she genuinely believes in it, she should make the commitment to regular reviews and to giving us all the detail necessary to make a proper assessment of whether this thing is workable. I hope the Government will at least accept that proposal because this is so serious. It is beyond draining to have to deal with the day-to-day crises families face and the utter failure of the State to deal with their housing needs. We think this scheme will make that problem worse. At the very least will the Minister of State commit to regular detailed reviews and to providing all the information we will need to assess it? 
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	Today we met officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection who confirmed in no uncertain terms that anyone who avails of HAP will be removed from the housing list. The Minister of State hesitated to say this but the officials confirmed it today. This will take many people off the housing list if they avail of HAP. The same happened when the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, was introduced in 2011. Anyone who joined the scheme was taken off the housing list. There will be uproar. The figure of almost 90,000 on the housing waiting list will be massaged. This is not adequate housing. It is unstable and the type of accommodation and its location will not be fit for purpose. In many cases that will be out of people’s control. The other problem is that they will have to source it themselves, whereas the local authorities should have some powers. What will happen in the Departments, where there is a recruitment embargo? Will that be lifted? It will cost money to move people about. We need to review the figures after six months and monitor this on an ongoing basis to see how many are taken off the homeless list and how many off the housing list. That is the point of Deputy Murphy’s amendment, to give us a picture before the scheme goes out of control. It is very important to include a provision to monitor this scheme.

We do not know how the inspection within eight months by an environmental officer will tally out. It is important to check the scheme. The Minister of State says it is a short-term initiative to give people a home, but so were RAS and rent allowance. They were not permanent or long-term and very few of them provided the type of housing that was needed.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	I am delighted to move this Bill in front of the new Minister for Justice and Equality. I hope the response we get from the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, gives us a message of hope, reform and change and includes a major dismissal of the events of the past. We need a new departure in the Department of Justice and Equality, in the appointment of judges and in the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and other top gardaí. There is very little doubt that there is a contaminated culture in the Garda. It is evident in the review the Minister has already ordered. I have proposed this Bill, which relates to the appointment of top gardaí, in the full knowledge that such appointments may be flawed and that the contaminated culture to which I refer has unfortunately spread beyond the people this Bill actually addresses. The reason for the crisis of confidence in the Garda has been clearly illustrated by recent events. This Bill begs certain questions. I refer not only to the questions of why the Commissioner resigned or was sacked, why the Minister resigned or why the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, Mr. Purcell, is now under a cloud, but also to the question of how these people, specifically the top gardaí, were actually appointed. Is this part of the cause of the crisis we are now facing in the administration of justice in this country? The Minister should make no mistake - there is no point in pretending otherwise - about the fact that the people have lost confidence in this country's top gardaí because of the behaviour of gardaí in recent times. It is no less a crisis than that. It is one which the Minister now faces. Part of this is due to the fact that there is an atmosphere of paranoia at the top of the Garda. I would like to refer to some of my own experiences. I would be very sympathetic with the role of gardaí and what they have done. My own experience of contact with gardaí, as a journalist and as a politician, is that they immediately flee to the bunker when they are asked questions. I have experienced that over many years. I have experienced it even more recently in my role as a Deputy. When I asked the gardaí how much it costs to fund the Garda Commissioner's office, they pleaded security reasons and all sorts of bogus camouflage to explain why they could not answer that question. When I rang the Department of Justice and Equality today to ask about the process for the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner that is required, the first answer I got was "hold on, we will ring you back and we will see if we can reply". Why could the Department not reply to such a simple question? We have a right to know the answer. When they did reply, they said they wanted the question in writing. They knew and I knew that I needed an answer to the question by 7.30 this evening. It is now 7.30 p.m. and they have still not replied to this simple question. Where is the process? What is happening? We have a vacancy at the top of the Garda. We are entitled to know what the process is. We are entitled to a reply from the Department of Justice and Equality on it. I do not know what they thought I was asking - perhaps they thought there was hostility involved - but they went back into their bunker. Unfortunately, that is the attitude of the press office in the Department of Justice and Equality. I received a similar type of response, one of hostility and paranoia, when I rang the Garda press office today. The person to whom I spoke was pretty defensive and referred me pretty quickly up to the Garda Commissioner's office. I got hold of a garda there who was anonymous. I was told it was an inappropriate question and I was referred to someone else who was more pleasant but did not give me an answer. That person referred me back to the Department of Justice and Equality, which has yet to reply. What is going on in justice in this country? One cannot get a response when one asks about the process being used to fill the most important position in the Garda. They cannot do it. They will not give an answer because they cannot get out of their bunker mentality. We should get answers to all of these questions now, when there is an actual vacancy to be filled. We should know what the process is, what the timetable is and how we will get a new Garda Commissioner. I have introduced this Bill, which relates to appointments at the top of the Garda, because it is extremely opportune that legislation of this sort should be in place to reform the appointments of people at the top of the force before the next Garda Commissioner is appointed. I would like to know whether that process is already in train. We do not know what process is being followed. If a Bill like this were passed, we could quite easily have a new Commissioner by September. I do not know what the process is, but I do know there seems to be a problem. The cancer of cronyism at the top of this country's justice system is continuing. I say that with conviction and without appearing to engage in sensationalism. Several Bills relating to the appointment of judges have already been introduced in this House. The continuing cronyist culture in that regard in this country has not been addressed for many years. Every single judge is politically appointed. It is only just emerging, on foot of the crisis we discovered in the Garda, that the top 200 - not the top two or three - gardaí are politically appointed. We have a kind of silence about it at the top. We need to see a dramatic and immediate change in order that people at the top of the gardaí are appointed in a new way. That needs to happen immediately. We should not countenance any delay in this regard. I anticipate that the Minister might well reply by saying "we are looking at this, we are very serious about it, we will do something about it, there will be a new system for the new Commissioner but it is going to take a certain amount of time". The figure I have just cited, that the top 200 gardaí are politically appointed, is pretty staggering, but I think it is worse than that. The system to which I refer is governed by the 2005 Act. How are all the other promotions decided? Are external interviews conducted? Is there a kind of incestuous relationship in which people who have done the right thing and who know the right people are appointed by their pals from above? It is a bit of a mystery, but it should not be. The appointment of all top gardaí - indeed, all gardaí - should be subject to an open competition. This Bill seeks to end the absolutely indefensible system of politicians, that is, the Cabinet, appointing the top 200 gardaí and to introduce a new system which, although not perfect and certainly subject to amendment, is far preferable to the current system. We must have an open contest, which this Bill introduces, that is open to outsiders and will ensure the independence of the Garda Síochána. Gardaí, and top gardaí in particular, must be appointed on merit. As it stands, we have a system which was described in a recent Garda Review editorial as involving the selection of a winner by a hidden hand in what amounted to a three ball lottery system. This Bill attempts, in a constructive and cost neutral way, to address this problem by removing the Garda from public control. The result will be that gardaí, for the first time, will be appointed on merit. The structure of appointments proposed in the Bill is very simple. At the top is the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, which, after carrying out advertising and interviews, will recommend three individuals to a subsidiary board comprising three members of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and two newly appointed members. This five member board will then recommend one individual to the Dáil. The beauty of this is that the TLAC is comprised mostly of civilians or outsiders. The Dáil, in turn, can accept or reject the recommended person, in which case a second individual will be recommended through the same process. A Dáil committee will be able to interview these candidates and make its own recommendation. The advantage of this system is that the appointment is not a matter for decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality or any other member of the Cabinet. In other words, it does not become a nakedly political appointment. The procedure I have outlined applies in the case of the top three members of the Garda. Other top appointments, namely, those of chief superintendents and superintendents, will be made by the appointments board. Again, there is no ministerial involvement. In fact, it is a Minister-free zone. This takes the appointments process out of the political arena and puts it into an area far removed from the type of criticism directed towards it recently. My reason for bringing forward this Bill is, quite simply, the huge controversies that have emerged recently. There can be no doubt whatsoever, from the controversies we have heard about, that there is something rotten in the Garda. The force needs, above all, to be removed from the political arena, and that is the essential principle upon which this Bill is pitched. The appointments process must be removed totally and utterly from the political arena and given to an external body which enjoys the public's respect. There is a difficulty here in that so many of those bodies have some element of political influence. It is very difficult to avoid that entirely, but this Bill represents a start. Its acceptance would be a recognition by the Minister that there is a terrible crisis at the top of the Garda. I hope and pray she does not come back with the response that this issue is being addressed by various bodies and we must await the outcome of this process. There is, at this very moment, a vacancy at the top of the Garda. This Bill could easily be passed by the House, with or without amendment, by the end of July. I ask the Minister to consider it and to consider also the issue of dismissals, which is included in the Bill. The dismissal of a Commissioner should only be possible with the permission of the Dáil. That function should not be in the political power of a Minister, because situations like this have been abused too much.

It is always refreshing to see Independent Deputies not only holding this Government to account but also putting forward new ideas and proposals to the House. The Bill is about Garda reform and I urge all Deputies to support it. It is about introducing new structures for the management of the Garda and safeguarding the professionalism of the force. Above all, it is about restoring public confidence and trust in our Garda service. I emphasise the word "service" here, because it is all about serving the public. We must ensure citizens have a professional police service in which they can trust. The Bill sets out its purpose as follows:[T]o provide for the independent appointment of Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and senior members of the Garda Síochána, to make the removal of such members more transparent and accountable, to amend the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 and 2013 and the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and to provide for related matters.The reforms it proposes are urgently needed. It is about ensuring the best gardaí get to the top of the force on merit, not on the basis of political connections or strokes. We must not duck and dive on this issue. Hard work, quality policing and dedication to our citizens must be the considerations that apply when it comes to the promotion of gardaí. The old ways must change so far as promotions are concerned, but we can retain some of the old values as represented by the hard-working garda on the beat who engages with his or her community. A good police officer never demands respect but earns it. This Bill will help us to shape the future of the force. It is helpful to consider some of the data on crime that are available to us. There were 66 homicide offences in 2011, increasing to 79 to 2012 and 80 in 2013. Fear and intimidation are a major tool in ensuring gangs maintain their hold on communities. Threats of murder have increased dramatically in the past decade, from 45 in 2004 to 348 in 2013. International data on intentional homicide from gun crime are difficult to compare due to different countries reporting in different ways. However, the rate of crime per thousand of population shows Ireland at 1.2 per 1,000, putting us ahead of England, France and China at 1.0, New Zealand at 0.9, Spain, Germany and Luxembourg at 0.8, and Sweden at 0.7. The gardaí in Limerick led an offensive against gang related crime there. In the past decade, they have arrested more than 60 leading gang members who have been imprisoned. In 2002, John Connolly of the Health Research Board showed that the statistics of crimes carried out by drug users tallied with the strong link between drugs and crime in the public mind. They are intertwined but many gangland killings are carried out by non-drug users and people attracted to gangland crime for other reasons. Studies from the USA and Sweden have shown that environmental factors have much greater impact in lower socioeconomic groups and this means that the nurture rather than nature factor is a bigger contributor to gang membership. I raise these issues because they are connected to the broader debate on gangland killings and on having top quality gardaí at the top of the Garda.

I wish the new Minister for Justice and Equality all the best. I compliment Deputy Ross on bringing forward the Public Sector Management (Appointment of Senior Members of the Garda Síochána) Bill 2014. He has been preparing it for quite some time and it is not a knee-jerk reaction to recent events in An Garda Síochána. I have said umpteen times in this House that the Garda Síochána, or any police force for that matter, cannot police without the full support of the public. That is what it is all about; it is a two-way process. I have been a member of Muintir na Tíre and community alert for many years, encouraging communities to support the Garda. It is very important the Garda Síochána has the trust of the people. Unfortunately, what has happened in recent times has besmirched the good name of An Garda Síochána. A very small number of events have really done damage to the people whom I salute and who have put their lives on the line day in, day out to maintain peace and stability in our country, and they need our support. Every member of An Garda Síochána, from the newest recruits right up to the Garda Commissioner, needs trust and respect. If they do not have that, things will not be right. I have many contacts and good friends in the Garda Síochána who have supported community alert, rural Ireland and the town of Clonmel. I mention two recently retired superintendents, Superintendents Courtney and Duggan. My feeling is that appointments are political. That is known and I hope the Minister will make a clean sweep with a new brush because we need to clean out that culture of political appointments and to be able to say without fear or favour that it is the people's and the Garda's Commissioner and not someone acting at the behest of a Minister or a Government. What happened recently with the Commissioner and the Minister, who are both gone and which came about under a cloud of darkness, was very unsavoury. We will never know about the trip that fateful night by the Secretary General of the Department to the Commissioner's home. We must have openness and transparency. We must go abroad to make appointments because this country is too small. I have little faith in the Public Appointments Service because, along with two colleagues from this House, I had to appoint a number of people to the fisheries board as the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, had a new idea. However, we were not welcome there. It had its own shortlist of people it wanted who were all retirees from other Departments. I happened to be chair of the appointments group and I gladly turned the list upside down and started from the bottom up. We need that culture in the public service to change. We will have to look for people from abroad when making appointments. I wish the acting Commissioner well and do not know what will happen to her but we need people from abroad to come here to clean up whatever mistrust is at the top. There is a feeling in the Garda Síochána that the detective branch has had too much sway. I know it does important work but one cannot have cliques in An Garda Síochána. It is one force serving the public at all times.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	I support the aim of this Bill brought forward by Deputy Ross, which is to de-politicise An Garda Síochána by providing for the independent appointment of the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and other senior members of the Garda. The Garda Act 2005 gives the Government very wide latitude and discretion as regards the appointment and removal of senior gardaí. It allows for Government to make appointments of superintendent and above and does not specify any qualifications or criteria that must be considered. Under section 11 of the Act, the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and assistant commissioners can be removed for a range of flimsy reasons. The Garda Commissioner alone can be removed for failing to have regard to section 26, which sets out the functions of the Garda Commissioner. These additional grounds for removal mean that the Commissioner's position is the most vulnerable of all to Government whim, as the last Commissioner found out to his peril. In the past few months alone, we have seen several scandals which highlight the dangers of politicisation of An Garda Síochána. We had called for the removal of the former Garda Commissioner on several occasions for different reasons but his eventual removal was to provide a public scapegoat for political problems. This was an unfair attempt to try to salvage the Government's reputation. A politicised Garda Síochána and the bias of the Government towards it resulted in the vitriolic and unfair treatment of the Garda ombudsman in the GSOC bugging scandal, a bias which continues with the unfair and untrue allegations that it has breached a statutory duty. Although the Government has confirmed that the next Garda Commissioner will be selected by open competition, it has not made any commitment to changing the legislation permanently in this regard. This is another short-term reaction to the recent series of Garda scandals rather than any meaningful and permanent reform of the manner in which the Garda Commissioner is appointed. Recent events have demonstrated the acute need for immediate reform to address the unhealthy nexus that exists between the Commissioner, the Minister and the Government. The findings of the Guerin report, including the Minister's acceptance at face value of the Garda Commissioner's investigation into a complaint against himself, reinforces the irrationality of the current structure. It is this direct and centralised Government control of a single, hierarchical national organisation which has been identified by Professor Dermot Walsh as "rendering the police vulnerable to being used by dominant interests as a vehicle for protecting their privilege, through the suppression of minority views and lifestyles". There must be a dilution of the current partisan political control over the Garda to ensure that too much police power is not left over-concentrated and under-accounted for in the hands of any party. Some other examples of over-politicisation in the Garda Act 2005 include section 40(2) referred to by Professor Dermot Walsh as an "alarming provision" which provides that the Minister or the Government can demand any record or documents from An Garda Síochána. The ministerial power under section 25 to issue directives to the Garda Commissioner "concerning any matter relating to An Garda Síochána" should also be removed. The direct accountability of the Commissioner to the Minister is very unhealthy. A rebalancing is particularly necessary in light of the extensive functions and powers of the Garda Síochána in providing both civil policing and security to the State. A Minister for Justice and Equality's reputation is too closely linked to that of the Garda Commissioner's under the current legislative structure. Section 26(3) of the Garda Act 2005 provides that the Garda Commissioner is solely accountable to the Minister in the performance of his functions. Criticising a Garda Commissioner's performance in a public forum would thus be akin to the Minister criticising himself and his own performance. Any holding to account is impossible in these circumstances. Using the medium of Parliament to provide democratic accountability allows the Minister and the Garda Commissioner to escape any parliamentary requests to explain policy with the excuse that something is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner, which we have heard many times. As the Garda Commissioner's conduct and performance is also exempt from GSOC's remit and due again to the exclusivity of accountability provided for under section 26(3), there is no further avenue or no other method of holding the Garda Commissioner, and by extension the Garda Síochána, to account once this operational matter excuse is provided to a parliamentary question. This difficulty was clearly demonstrated by our efforts to raise by way of parliamentary question the issue of Garda racial profiling of Travellers on PULSE. The then Minister was content to tell us that the Garda Commissioner said that racial profiling did not exist, so that was good enough for him. The over-politicised nature of our police force is also powerfully illustrated by many aspects of the Cooke report.The 64 page report was published by Government at 8.45 p.m. on Tuesday last. Fifteen minutes later, the headlines on the RTE news at 9 o'clock could only repeat the selective quotes that had already been leaked by Government sources to certain journalists who are widely recognised to be uncritical of the Garda. The tactic was previously employed by the Government press office on the publication of the Garda Inspectorate report into penalty points. Despite a handful of exceptions, the Government line has generally been accepted by the media establishment, without question or serious analysis. The Government has praised the report both in the Dáil and on "Prime Time" for being "comprehensive" and for reaching "evidence-based" conclusions following "rigorous" investigation. I wonder whether it has considered any of the following points. The former judge concluded that there was no evidence of Garda involvement. However, he did not seek any evidence, he did not question a single garda, nor did he request a report from the Garda Commissioner regarding, for example, the storage and log books of IMSI catchers, or the possibility of the involvement of rogue gardaí. He did not seek to question the senior gardaí who were the subject of two highly sensitive GSOC investigations, investigations which the retired judge admitted led to the heightened tension and paranoia between GSOC and the Garda Síochána at the time. The retired judge admitted that the most significant "anomaly" identified by Verrimus "remains unexplained". That was the ring-back to a telephone which bypassed the main switch at 1.30 a.m. and which occurred immediately after a TALAN test. The absence of any explanation for that mysterious occurrence is inconsistent with the report's conclusions. The possibility of lawful surveillance was never investigated at all. Although the terms of reference cleverly require an examination only of unlawful surveillance, the elimination of the possibility of lawful surveillance would appear to be a basic requirement if the priority was to establish the truth. The former justice Minister refused to answer that question both at committee and in my parliamentary question to him in this Chamber in February. A senior garda can bypass judicial supervision completely and internally authorise another garda to conduct covert surveillance. That is entirely lawful if it is done in accordance with the exceptional circumstances set out in section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009. If lawful surveillance by the Garda, the Army or Revenue was at issue, the retired judge could then have examined whether it was in fact lawful, that is, whether those exceptional circumstances did in fact exist. Rogue gardaí could have received permission from other senior gardaí and bugged GSOC without breaking the law, but the matter has not been examined by Mr. Justice Cooke. The report asserts a breach of statutory obligation by GSOC in its failure to report the results and progress but fails to mention that section 103 allows for exemptions if, in GSOC's opinion, that were necessary in the public interest. That has been repeated ad nauseam by Government speakers. Such a selective and incomplete reading of the relevant legislation is a strange omission for a former judge of Mr. Justice Cooke's experience and stature. The report does not assess any evidence of an attempted security breach at GSOC, as requested by paragraph 3 of the terms of reference, preferring to focus on whether "actual surveillance" took place. The judge appeared to accept that ordinary surveillance of the Verrimus personnel took place, but does not view that as corroborating evidence nor does he consider it alongside the three technical "anomalies". That type of surveillance is unregulated in Ireland and that may be the reason the retired judge did not consider it. He did not appear overly concerned that Verrimus was the subject of ordinary surveillance while conducting the GSOC operation, nor was he curious about the identity of those who carried out the surveillance, although he stated that could only be examined by a statutory investigation. In fairness, the retired judge went to some lengths to set out in his introduction that the report has "no authority to make binding findings of fact, much less definitive ones", that it does not have "authority to adjudicate on disputes of fact", and that it has been reliant on the "voluntary co-operation" of the parties concerned. The report also states that its conclusions are "based upon my personal evaluation and opinion". He stated they were not judicial, nor the result of a statutory inquiry by a sitting judge with powers of compellability. That is in contrast to the disingenuous efforts of Government to impart a sheen of legitimacy by emphasising at every opportunity that this paper review was conducted by a retired judge. It was by and large a paper review of secondary evidence already available rather than an investigation from first principles. Had the impossible happened and incontrovertible proof been provided and established on the unlawful Garda bugging of GSOC, that would have resulted in huge upheaval within some of the more sacred institutions of the State, and yet another possibly fatal blow for the party of law and order in the run-up to the next general election. If there was an appetite for the truth, we would get an independent inquiry and nothing less. If we want to have a police force that we can be proud of, one that operates in a transparent manner, and is accountable for everything it does, we will also need to begin the process of depoliticising An Garda Síochána.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	445	The Garda Síochána Act 2005 explicitly allows the Government to make appointments at superintendent level and above. There is no specification of any qualifications or criteria. The Government can literally appoint whoever it likes without any accountability. In addition, the grounds on which the Government of the day can also seek to remove the senior officers that are at the heart of Deputy Ross’s Bill are flimsy. One could ask whether it is really any wonder that we have such a dysfunctional system, as has been exposed recently, when such a system prevails at the higher echelons. It is perfectly understandable that anyone who wants to rise to those ranks must, in order to get there, curry favour with the political establishment of the day so that they might end up in the right place to get the nod when the time is right. The other side of the equation is that once they get there, the tendency is to reward their masters, those who put them there in the first place. That is incredibly unhealthy in any system which purports to be democratic. We made the point many times during the recent controversies that much of what happened could not have happened without the dysfunctional relationship - a lawful one - between the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner. It is not that the former Minister for Justice and Equality did nothing when he received the complaints – he did. He went to the Commissioner, asked him what was the story and the Commissioner said, “Don’t worry about it Alan. There is nothing to worry about,” and the former Minister said: “That is grand.” That was a hugely contributing factor to the problem. The politicised nature of the relationship between the Government, and the Garda Commissioner being only accountable to the Minister, was very much epitomised by the “Prime Time” debacle with the former Minister revealing information about Deputy Wallace in order to score political points. It was information he could not have come by accidentally and which could only have been found by a trawl at the behest of the Minister. Deputy Shatter has been found guilty of breaking data protection law in that regard but it is worth making the point. Accountability is at the heart of the Bill. That is an issue on which we have all focused. Nobody disputes that is necessary. The Government’s response to that is at last we will get an independent Garda authority which will oversee the functioning of the force. I put it to the Minister that such a move on its own is not enough. If we simply put an authority at the top of the force as it is now, rely on those who are currently in management positions to continue to rule the roost and do not have a change in the mechanism for appointments, the problems will replicate themselves. When we say what is necessary is a Patten-style commission, we do so not because we think the Patten inquiry was brilliant and that there are no problems in the police force in Northern Ireland – there absolutely are – but because we need to go back to the drawing board and look at what are the objectives of a modern police service. Now is a completely different time from when the Garda Síochána was selected. One could ask how people should be recruited to the force. The top echelons set the scene and are very influential in picking those who are further down the ladder in terms of who can go forward for promotion. Recruitment and training must be addressed if we are to have an acceptable police force. I tried to raise the issue of politicised policing with the Taoiseach in the context of the policing of the Corrib gas site.He either was unable to or did not understand the point or was unwilling to answer it. Instead, he tried to divert the issue by talking about the merits or otherwise of the Shell project, when the question I posed to him was about the policing of it. He spoke about local people protesting as if there was a difference between what the former justice Minister, Deputy Shatter, called tourist protestors and locals. The point, however, was there were no local protestors but local residents who got in the way of a multinational. There is something utterly wrong in An Garda Síochána basically being an organisation for hire to act at the behest of a multinational. There is something utterly wrong in up to 30 gardaí intimidating an elderly woman and her husband to get a pipe down a narrow road when there was no one objecting. All human rights organisations have pinpointed these problems exist. This Bill is a positive contribution and brings our attention to the top echelons of the force. We have been on record, and will do so again, as stating very few of those in the senior ranks of the Garda will make the grade of a reconstituted force, given that many of them have been involved in some of the most appalling miscarriages of justice and have stood over bad practices.

The House will not need reminding of the many issues which have arisen in recent months relating to the Garda Síochána and the administration of justice. Last week, we saw the publication of the Cooke report; last month, the Guerin report was published. We know of the many various allegations by Garda whistleblowers, as well as the public disquiet regarding the penalty points system. Regrettably, as a result, we have witnessed an erosion of public confidence in the work of the Garda. It is essential in a democracy that the public has full confidence in how the Garda carries out its functions. The Government has, therefore, rightly taken action to ensure these issues are dealt with in an independent and impartial manner that commands public confidence. The allegations about penalty points have been referred to GSOC, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, for independent investigation. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate has prepared a report on reform of the fixed-charge penalty system and its recommendations are now being implemented. I acknowledge the contribution made by Deputies opposite tonight to raising these issues. Today, the Garda announced it has commenced implementation of the inspectorate's short-term recommendations which will be welcomed by the public because they provide far greater clarity than there has been before. The inspectorate's report highlighted the significant changes necessary in this regard. A commission of investigation, headed by Mr. Justice Fennelly, has commenced work in examining the issues relating to the recording of telephone calls at Garda stations and associated matters. The Government commissioned a report by Sean Guerin into the way in which Garda whistleblower allegations regarding crime investigations were handled. The Government also commissioned a further, now-published, report by Mr. Justice Cooke into the claims of unlawful surveillance of GSOC. We will discuss that report in the House on Thursday and I look forward to having a detailed opportunity then to address matters raised about it tonight. One by one, in each case, the Government has put in place a mechanism for an authoritative examination of claims and allegations, so the facts can be discovered, the truth established and necessary action taken. The Government also recognises, however, that the issues and failings identified are resolved is more critical. A whole process to implement these recommendations is required to deal with this wide range of issues. We need not only to address specific difficulties that arise, but also to identity the kind of longer-term reforms that will ensure continued public confidence in the Garda Síochána, as well as in the vital policing and security service it provides. The Government has, therefore, initiated a comprehensive programme of reform to address the wider systemic failings in the areas of policing and the administration of justice, including those which have emerged from the Guerin report. I reject the claim by some Members opposite that it is only piecemeal reform. Any fair analysis of the range of actions taken by the Government will agree it is a comprehensive programme of reform. The spectrum of issues that must be addressed is complex and deep-rooted ranging from high-level issues such as oversight, change management and the role of whistleblowers to local administration and internal communication, as well as matters of basic policing, performance and human resources. The Guerin report identified clearly a wide and disturbing range of issues such as the supervision of probationary gardaí and the taking of evidence. These serious issues demand a response from the Garda. A new Cabinet committee on justice reform has been established, the first time such a high-level committee has been established. It is headed by the Taoiseach and comprises the Tánaiste, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Attorney General. This committee is overseeing this comprehensive programme of policing reform. As part of this programme of reform, an independent Garda authority is to be established by the end of this year. Future appointments to the position of Garda Commissioner will be by way of open competition. I remind Deputy Ross that I have stated in several fora, including the Dáil, that this position will be advertised in July as an open competition and advertised internationally. I also hope the new Garda authority will have a role to play in that appointment. The Garda Inspectorate is to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation, as well as management and operational issues arising from the findings of the report by Mr. Guerin. As was acknowledged on the radio this morning, I had a long meeting with the Garda Inspectorate on the work it is doing. It will work on the issues identified in the Guerin report and report back to me. The Government has agreed to establish a further commission of investigation as recommended in the Guerin report. On foot of last week's publication of the Cooke report, the Government will now proceed to consider the terms of reference and formally establish the commission. An independent expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality has been established. No one can question the credentials of the range of expertise I have appointed to the review group. It has begun its work. Amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill will be enacted to enable a Garda whistleblower to report his or her concerns to GSOC. New legislation will be introduced shortly to strengthen the remit and powers of GSOC. While the then Government in 2005 responded to the findings of the Morris tribunal, it is clear the subsequent legislation introduced then is inadequate and its failings have come to the fore. While I do not have time to go into it tonight, I have outlined several areas where the GSOC legislation will be reformed in the near future.When the Garda authority is established later in the year we will have an opportunity to examine further changes to how GSOC operates. For the first time we will establish an independent Garda authority. This will undoubtedly be the most significant change in oversight of the Garda Síochána since its foundation. As I stated, I acknowledge change was introduced in 2005, but deeper reform is now necessary and the Garda authority will be central to this. I set out the background to the Government's programme of reform because the Bill put forward by Deputy Ross seeks to address one single aspect of reform, namely, the way in which appointments are made to the top ranks in the Garda Síochána. It is important to appreciate how individual reforms, such as the way in which the most senior members of the force are appointed, must be designed to fit properly in the new policing regime and oversight architecture. Anybody examining this topic this evening would have to agree we should not be bringing forward reform in a piecemeal manner but in a way in which the various aspects of reform compliment each other. This is the general difficulty I have with the Bill. It puts forward a proposal on the appointment of senior members of the Garda Síochána, but does not take into account how this might fit the wider reforms under way. Taking the proposed independent Garda authority as a key example of these reforms, as far as I can tell from comments to date it enjoys a broad measure of support across the House. I intend to bring forward the necessary legislative changes later this year so the authority can be in place by the end of the year. This is a very challenging timetable but I intend to make it a top priority. While the details of its functions will need to be fully worked out as part of this legislative process, and I look forward to discussing the details in the House, one of its more obvious potential roles will be to have involvement in the process of appointment of the most senior members of the Garda Síochána. In saying this I do not anticipate any decisions by the Government and still less of the House and serious consideration will need to be given to the issue and precisely what the nature of the involvement of the new Garda authority will be, but broadly comparable bodies, such as the police authorities in the North or in Scotland, have an important role in senior police appointments. I note the study trip undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to examine the police authority models in these areas and their role in senior police appointments. The joint committee has also held hearings. We await the outcomes of these hearings, on which I will receive a report shortly. We also await the deliberations of the committee following its trip to examine how police authorities operate in other countries. The issue of the functions of a new Garda authority and the question of its role in appointing senior Garda members will also be the subject of discussion at the consultation event which I will convene on Friday in Farmleigh, where key stakeholders will spend the morning discussing the new Garda authority. A wide range of stakeholders will attend the event and all of the members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality have been invited. The outcome will certainly form part of a very important consultative process with a wide range of relevant stakeholders. The Bill takes no account of the forthcoming Garda authority or the extensive consultations under way involving a wide range of voices. Instead the Bill proposes a prescriptive approach to a singular area of reform, isolated from consideration of other reforms. The Bill proposes a free-standing system of appointment to the senior Garda ranks by a new public appointments board, following an open competition conducted by the Top Level Appointments Committee, and involving the approval of this House in the case of the Garda Commissioner or a recommendation by an Oireachtas committee in the case of other senior ranks. I find it very difficult to see how the House could be asked to establish such a system on the eve of the introduction of proposals for an independent Garda authority. The Bill effectively states that the new independent Garda authority will have no role in the most senior Garda appointments. Leaving aside the detail of the Bill, it is premature to ask the House to take a decision now which would anticipate its decision on the role of the authority, and to take this decision in advance of considering the outcome of the substantial process of consultations now under way, including the valuable and important work of the joint committee, the consultation event taking place on Friday and the other work I have referenced. If we look at the detail of the Bill, there is also the question as to whether a key element of it, namely a requirement for the approval of the House for the appointment of a person to the post of Garda Commissioner, is in any event the right approach. At the outset of my remarks I recalled the controversies which had arisen about the Garda Síochána, and the potential damage which the resulting political controversies could inflict on what is a vital public service. I explained how the Government had taken decisive steps to resolve these controversies in a way which was evidently independent and impartial, and which would command public attention and respect. However, one could argue that the Bill, in requiring the approval of the House for the appointment of a Garda Commissioner, would put politics right back into policing as opposed to an independent Garda authority taking the decision. By all means let us debate this at the proper time when the legislative proposals for the Garda authority are before the House, but surely we cannot introduce such a measure, with such potentially far-reaching consequences, in the Bill. I also find it odd that the Bill, although it is designed to deal with senior Garda appointments, provides for the extension of the remit of the proposed public appointments board to other sectors within the public service. We should recall there is already a structure set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act for appointments to large parts of the public service. It is also the case that the 2004 Act, which provides for the Public Appointments Service and the Commission for Public Service Appointments, can be extended to other public sector bodies by ministerial order. I would have thought that proposals for such a major change to public service appointments generally should be debated fully in their own right and not tagged on as a single section in a Bill dealing with Garda appointments. The Bill deals with an important issue, which is the process of making appointments to the most senior positions in the Garda Síochána. I welcome the debate, but I cannot welcome or support a proposal which is premature and being put forward in isolation to the other vital reforms which I mentioned are taking place. I want to emphasise this is not because I wish to avoid reform; it is quite the contrary, and the point is that significant reforms are under way. As I stated, and I will not go into the detail again, the Government has already announced that there will be an open competition for the post of Garda Commissioner. The Government has already announced plans for a new independent Garda authority, to be in place very shortly. By any measure I believe these are some of the most important reforms to the Garda Síochána ever proposed. I look forward to the debate on these proposals, and the contribution of all Deputies, but the discussion on the process of Garda appointments needs to be part of a wider debate. We need the process of Garda reform to be comprehensive and cohesive. We need to consider all aspects of this reform. We need to ensure, as far as we possibly can, that we get it right. This Bill does not achieve this and I therefore regret that I cannot support it.

I welcome the announcement by the Minister in her speech to the effect that the various reforms put forward in Deputy Ross's Bill are being acted upon by the Government. It goes without saying that if one examines the activities of various police forces throughout the world in recent years there have been numerous occasions where reform was required and this is no exception. This should not be taken as a blanket overall castigation of An Garda Síochána. It is hugely important that the general public, wherever it may be, has absolute confidence in its police force at all levels. At all times the general public needs to be reassured that the police force acting on its behalf acts with its full authority and support and is independent of any type of manipulation from any quarter. This is not to suggest for one moment that the Garda has been manipulated in any fashion by anybody.Certainly, during my time in this House I have seen members of An Garda Síochána work solidly on behalf of the State to protect it and as I have stated previously, on many occasions they paid the ultimate price for so doing. In a number of situations over the past 25 or 30 years, members of An Garda Síochána in the front line or the front row had no option except to do their duty and when called upon to do their duty, they did it. Moreover, they did it without fear or favour and many were injured or maimed and many paid the ultimate price. Members should not have a debate of this nature without recording their appreciation to An Garda Síochána for the tremendous work it has done in difficult times over a difficult era when there were many challenges both within and without. Consequently, it goes without saying that the reforms now proposed are not by way of criticism but are by way of consolidation and by way of providing confidence among the public on the extent to which the modern police force must be independent and in respect of what is required in the modern era. It also is no harm to remember that in recent years, almost every aspect of society has been challenged. Every profession, including politics and elsewhere, has been challenged and various issues have arisen that have not shown various professions in a good light. As a result, it has been necessary to undertake reforms that are taking place. Moreover, it is appropriate that they should, because without such reforms there will be a continued lack of confidence in the system. While it is easy for everybody to point his or her finger and to state everything was meant to be changed, things have changed fairly dramatically within a short time. Although the extent of the change has not yet been fully perceived, it is taking place. As for those who suggest the changes did not take place quickly enough, I note the resources necessary to bring about all those changes are not as evidently available as they appear to be in some quarters of the House. I refer to the reforms required in An Garda Síochána back in 2005 and as the Minister has just indicated, those reforms did not go to the extent they should have gone at that time. In fairness to members of the Garda Síochána at all levels who did the job at huge personal cost to themselves many times over those years, Members should not fail to recognise the sacrifices they made. They made huge familial and personal sacrifices and did their jobs well. Members have often spoken about those people who intoned to Members privately the things they perceived to be wrong within the administration. Sometimes they were right and perhaps sometimes they were wrong but the time now has come for an overall evaluation of the structures, which is good. Moreover, it should be and will be comprehensive to restore public confidence in the administration of justice. There are many other aspects of the system that require reform. While I have no doubt but that this will happen, in my short contribution I can only express my hope that at the end of the day, confidence will be restored in An Garda Síochána and those gardaí who have done their jobs selflessly throughout the years will be vindicated.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	I welcome the publication of the Bill, as I would welcome the publication of any Bill that generates debate, and I congratulate Deputy Ross on its publication. I welcome the Minister and wish to take this first opportunity to congratulate her officially on her appointment as Minister under challenging circumstances in the year that is in it. One could say that 2014 will go down as the year of Garda scrutiny. I wish to take this opportunity to commend those who have brought issues to the fore within the Garda over the past six months and earlier, some within this House as well as the whistleblowers themselves, who have done the State justice in speaking out and highlighting their issues of concern within their serious and challenging occupation in the context of the protection of the State and one of its most important institutions, the Garda Síochána. It is right for the Garda, as for any State body, to have standards and that every effort is made to hold up gardaí to those standards. It also is right for Members to acknowledge the majority of excellent members of the Garda Síochána, who do an excellent job day in and day out in difficult circumstances and challenging environments throughout the country. They have become demoralised by all that has gone on in recent times and it is important to acknowledge the role they play in protecting families and the State on a daily basis. I also wish to acknowledge the changes enacted in 2014 with regard to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Síochána. I refer to the publication of the Guerin report on whistleblowing, the Cooke report on the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, bugging, the Finlay commission on taping and the proposed establishment by the Government of an independent police authority. The latter will deal with many of the items and issues highlighted and detailed in the Bill that is being drafted at present. I certainly will welcome the publication of that Bill, what it entails and the overall establishment of the independent police authority. The Government has stated previously that the new Garda Commissioner is to be appointed by way of open competition, which is a welcome, progressive and inclusive step. As to whether this should be extended to other roles, as outlined in the Bill before Members, is a question for debate. As for suggesting the existing structures are not fit for purpose, however, one must consider what evidence there is that a new system would be different. Second, one must consider whether all the fault that has been experienced in the past six or 12 months can be put down to the existing structure or the appointment system in place at present. The Garda Commissioner has a difficult job and has a responsibility to the public ultimately, as well as to the rank-and-file members of the Garda. It is a challenging balancing act between ensuring one has the public's full confidence and having that responsibility to members of the Garda. I will not say it is a responsibility to protect them but to ensure that where allegations arise, members are not hung out to dry. Any Commissioner is only human and whether appointed through the existing structures, the system outlined by Deputy Ross or the planned open recruitment system that is to be initiated for the new Commissioner, ultimately he or she will have decisions to make. Like any human, mistakes can be made and perhaps he or she could say or do something he or she will regret. However, there is no reason to believe that any of the actions that took place over the past six months would have been different under a Commissioner appointed by a different system. Decisions are made by humans. I could make a decision that would be different from that made by Deputies O'Mahony and Harris or anybody else. Ultimately, it is the individual himself or herself, the role he or she plays and the powers he or she has. A Commissioner should have a good working relationship with the Minister. They should not necessarily be best friends but should have a good healthy regard for each other's positions and roles. A Commissioner must be willing to investigate complaints from the public and from the Garda. I have spoken previously in this Chamber with regard to my hope for whistleblowers, which is that any future whistleblower will be treated properly by any future Garda Commissioner. I commend the Bill on its publication in terms of the debate Members are having. I certainly welcome the setting up of the independent Garda authority, as well as the initiatives taken by the Minister and her predecessor in recent months to sort out many of the problems that have arisen within the Garda Síochána.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and on the debate generated by its publication and tabling in this Chamber. I welcome and it is important to acknowledge - as sadly, others have failed to do - the work that already has been undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in her short period as Minister for Justice and Equality. The Minister has a record of reform that can be seen clearly in her work in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the passage of the children's referendum and the establishment of the Child and Family Agency. I have no doubt but that she is continuing that reforming attitude in her new role. It is important, however, that any debate should take place with a holistic view of the issues and challenges facing An Garda Síochána and broader society in terms of how it interacts with the justice system. A root and branch examination of the matters that have come to public light is clearly needed and action is needed on foot of those examinations. Hence, there is the Guerin report and the Cooke report, as well as agreement by the Government on a commission of inquiry into various serious allegations. In addition, an expert review of the Department of Justice and Equality is under way, as well as agreement to establish a new Garda authority for the first time in the history of the State. I have heard accusations in this House tonight and in recent days and weeks that the Government's approach is piecemeal. That does not stand up to any level of fair and objective scrutiny. In fact, it lowers the standard of debate and it demeans it to a soundbite rather than substance. The Government is addressing all issues in a methodical and thorough manner. Many Members on all sides of the House have shown a constructive attitude, an acknowledgment that things need to change and an acknowledgment that there is a significant body of work to be done. To simply pick off one issue of how senior gardaí are appointed and to endeavour to deal with it in isolation from the many other necessary developments, most particularly the establishment of a new Garda authority, would be foolhardy. We need to look seriously at how senior Garda appointments are made and to that end I welcome Deputy Ross's debate on the issue and the decision by the Government that the next Garda Commissioner will be appointed by way of open competition. However, we need to look at issues of oversight, appointments and transparency together. We need to work constructively to ask how a Garda authority would function, what is best international practice and what is best for Ireland and our culture. The stakeholders consultation this week on Friday is an extremely useful and important event. We have to bring the broad range of stakeholders with us. It is a much more inclusive and thorough way of going about business than stand-alone legislation which attempts to place the issue of appointments in a silo. To deal with appointments alone in this Bill in the full knowledge of the reality that the establishment of a Garda authority is under way makes a mockery of consulting stakeholders and it also has an implication with which I am not comfortable. Deputy Kyne touched on this in his contribution. It has an implication that appointments and the appointments structure is at the root of the problems and the challenges. I say to Deputy Ross that there is no evidence to support that argument. There is no evidence to suggest that if another group of human beings, if another group of politicians around a table or another Commissioner or grouping or body of individuals had arrived at a different appointment that the culture in the Garda Síochána, the systems and the safeguards, would have been different. The Guerin report is a compelling read and one must presume it indicates some systemic issues within An Garda Síochána. The issues to which the report refers are very basic ones relating to training, education and facilities in Garda stations. They have very little, if anything, to do with the manner in which a person is to be appointed. It is not to suggest that the appointments system does not need to be examined but rather it is an acknowledgment that they will be looked at and an acknowledgment that we must examine all the issues facing An Garda Síochána and our justice system in a holistic fashion. That is why I think the Garda authority is a really exciting development. The justice committee has begun undertaking work and consultation on how such an authority works in other jurisdictions, and this is to be welcomed. Sadly, there have been some slurs made in this House that have cast an aspersion on all members of An Garda Síochána. I am sure that is not the intention of any Member of this House. It must be remembered that in the history of the State, 85 gardaí have died in the line of duty. We must remember that while not perfect and no different from this institution, and while An Garda Síochána has had bad apples in it, this does not take away from the work of its members who get up every day and keep our society safe and tackle subversiveness. It is a difficult time to be a garda. We owe it to citizens of this country, including members of An Garda Síochána, to deliver a thorough, comprehensive, fair and thought-out inclusive response to the issues that have emerged rather than having a knee-jerk reaction. We must get this right because we owe it to every citizen, including every member of An Garda Síochána and every courageous whistleblower who has come to the fore in recent weeks and months. I commend the Minister on her work. I welcome the debate on this Bill but in my view its approach is one of isolation rather than inclusiveness and it needs to be looked at in the context of the Garda authority.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	451	I welcome the opportunity to participate in this timely debate. The Minister has outlined the significant issues which have arisen in the administration of justice. This Bill deals with a central proposed reform of the Garda Síochána and is to be welcomed. I agree with the principle of an independent system for appointments but Deputy Ross's Bill misses the point which has been debated in this House over recent months. The Members of this House all agree on the need for the establishment of an independent policing authority. The provisions in Deputy Ross's Bill would deny an independent policing authority the main function to support and sustain its independence which is the appointment of the most senior person in An Garda Síochána and his or her senior management team. The Bill does not make any sense. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that she will oppose it because my party will also oppose it. There are currently a number of vacancies in the highest ranks of An Garda Síochána: the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Garda Commissioner, an assistant Garda commissioner vacancy and three chief superintendent vacancies. There is spare capacity at the top of An Garda Síochána and the right people must be found to fill those vacancies. The Minister addressed the issue of the appointment of a Garda Commissioner. This is the subject of my priority parliamentary question to the Minister next week and the Minister in her contribution tonight has addressed my question in part. I suggest the Minister should consider delaying the appointment until an independent policing board is established. The Minister has an ambitious timeline for the establishment by the end of the year of a fully independent and functioning policing board and it is good to aim for targets. However, what we learned on our trip last week is that Scotland established an interim independent policing board and this policy has some merit which the Minister may wish to consider. It may not be helpful to the person who is appointed as Garda Commissioner for a four or five year period if he or she is appointed in advance of the new independent policing authority. Either position might be weakened in that situation. I agree with previous contributors that An Garda Síochána has experienced a battering, so to speak. We all interact with gardaí every day of the week and they are looking to us for hope. We must give them that hope and we must support them. I have always tried to temper my remarks. I agree we have to hold them to account and I agree we must criticise them - God knows they do not like taking criticism, just as none of us likes taking criticism. An Garda Síochána in particular does not like taking criticism. There needs to be a cultural change in An Garda Síochána and it is beginning to acknowledge the need for such a change. However, I do not agree with some of the points of view of other speakers who have thrown a wet blanket over the entire force, such as that there is a cancer of cronyism and that lots of things are rotten in the force. This is not helpful. I agree there have been problems with issues relating to whistleblowers and with meeting standards and malpractice. Debating those issues all over again will not move the situation forward. We have learned from them but some of the language in this debate is ill-tempered and is not justified. The message some people are trying to send in this debate is that those who have been promoted in An Garda Síochána did not merit their promotions. I did not hear any of those speakers offering any examples. They have no working knowledge of the system of promotion in An Garda Síochána nor of the competition process which brings candidates to the stage whereby they are politically appointed. This brings me to my next point. Deputy Ross's Bill proposes that the Oireachtas appoint the Garda Commissioner, which is farcical. The Deputy should give us a break, especially as it coincides with the proposal to establish an independent policing board and remove politics from the appointment of senior Garda officers. We know where the sensationalism and populism starts on this issue but where does it end? On the one hand, it is suggested it is wrong for the Executive to appoint a Garda Commissioner, notwithstanding that the Government is accountable and may be, and often is, turfed out of office by the electorate. On the other hand, it is suggested that it would be right for 166 Deputies, or 158 Deputies in the next Dáil, to appoint the next Garda Commissioner. That position does not make sense.  We must adopt a model in which civic society, interest groups and people with appropriate qualifications sit on an independent policing board and drive forward the organisation. These individuals should recruit the chief executive officer of the board and the Garda Commissioner. This model would be in line with practice in the North and in Scotland and the majority of other countries where independent policing authorities appoint the chief of police. This is the model we should adopt. It does not make sense that Deputy Ross, who campaigns against quangos, is seeking to establish a new quango.  The Bill proposes the establishment of a system similar to the Top Level Appointments Commission, TLAC, which appoints senior civil servants. Deputy Ross has been vocal in describing the TLAC process as one in which insiders promote insiders. The hypocrisy evident on this issue shows no bounds. We must learn from the experience in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Last week, I and other members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality visited both jurisdictions where we met representatives of the independent policing boards of Northern Ireland and Scotland. Before last week, I had not taken part in a single junket since entering local politics in 2004. However, I was so interested in trying to ensure this matter is dealt with correctly that I decided to take part in the visit to Belfast and Edinburgh and of course I lived it up during the two-day trip. We packed six meetings into one and a half days, during which we learned with great interest how the Northern Ireland and Scottish independent policing boards operate. Highly structured and transparent systems are in place in both jurisdictions for the appointment of senior police officers. As with Oireachtas committees, the independent policing boards hold regular public and private meetings and meet as full committees and sub-committees. They are able to challenge and hold the respective heads of their police forces to account. Further, because they made the appointment they cannot outsource blame for problems that may arise to a quango.  I am highly critical of the local appointments commission, which appoints powerful, influential but untouchable local authority managers who have substantial reserve functions. It is wrong that no one can query or criticise the work of city and county managers. They should be appointed by the members of the local authority they serve, just as an independent policing authority should appoint the Garda Commissioner.  While I am unable to attend the worthwhile consultation exercise planned for Farmleigh, I will send my researcher to the event. On our visit to Northern Ireland and Scotland last week, members of the joint committee learned that the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Dr. Michael Maguire, had previously been the Chief Inspector of Criminal Justice in Northern Ireland. In this State we have the Inspector of Prisons and Garda Inspectorate, while Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions have an inspectorate that covers the entire criminal justice system, including the courts and office of director of public prosecutions or equivalent. Problems have arisen in this jurisdiction with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We do not have transparent oversight of the office, nor do we know to what standards it operates. Rather than having separate inspectorates such as the Garda Síochána Inspectorate and Inspector of Prisons, there would be merit in establishing an overarching inspectorate for the entire criminal justice system. Such an entity would also tie in nicely to the proposed independent policing authority. I do not hold any brief for any of the incumbents or individuals who wish to be appointed to positions in the Garda Síochána. I wish the acting Garda Commissioner, Ms Nóirín O'Sullivan, well in her current capacity. There was a small hiccup at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and in fairness to the acting Garda Commissioner, having been blind-sided, she put the matter right. She also made a positive start with the whistleblowers. Ms O'Sullivan and all members of An Garda Síochána deserve credit for the fact that crime statistics are moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, recent events have shown that crime is ravaging the streets of parts of Dublin. The shooting of a six-year old child in a botched, gangland hit in Ballyfermot and an attack on a 16 year old in Clondalkin at the weekend were unbelievable incidents for which there is no justification or excuse. Communities must not tolerate such acts and must support An Garda Síochána. I ask the Minister to address one point made in a report published today by the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate, Mr. Bob Olsen. Garda transport is an old chestnut about which Deputies hear regularly because we meet gardaí every day. A multi-annual dedicated budget for fleet management is required in order that the Garda knows how much will be available for capital expenditure on the Garda fleet, which is currently not fit for purpose. As the Minister is aware, with the exception of Dublin and the east coast generally, the population is dispersed and predominately rural. We need a mobile police service to keep people safe.  The Bill is ill thought out and does not make sense given that those who support it also support the establishment of an independent policing authority. One cannot support this legislation while supporting the establishment of an independent policing authority without the most important function of a policing authority, namely, the power to appoint the most senior police officer. 
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	452	I concur with many of the points made by Deputy Niall Collins. If the establishment of an independent policing authority were not imminent, the Bill would certainly deliver an improvement on the current position of having appointments made at Cabinet level by the Minister.What is being proposed in this Bill is the establishment of a body where nominations would come before 158 Deputies following the next election and then there would be either agreement or not. If there were no agreement, there is another process to follow which is laid out in the Bill. If we were in a situation where there was no intention to establish an independent policing authority, one could certainly say that the Bill is a marked improvement on the current process. However, we are looking at the establishment of an independent policing authority. It is the view of my party that an independent policing authority is the best way to deal with the issue of appointments of senior gardaí, whether Commissioners or assistant commissioners. We have seen it working successfully in the Six Counties. We have seen it working in Scotland. One only has to look at last week where a new Chief Constable was appointed to the PSNI who received unanimous support across both communities because of the independent and transparent way in which that process is outlined. Deputy Mac Lochlainn will focus more tomorrow evening on the particular thrust of the Bill which is the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and assistant commissioners. Deputy Ross desires that this could be extended to appointments in other public areas and that would be done by ministerial order if the Minister so approves. That is not the correct way to do it. If we want senior appointments to public bodies to be free from political influence, what is proposed in this Bill will not do that. What Deputy Ross proposes in sections 3 and 4, in terms of possibly extending it to other bodies, would no doubt strengthen public accountability and transparency but the fact that it would still be up to 158 Members of this Chamber to ultimately vote and hire that particular person does not fully remove it from the political process, which is what we need to do. My party wants to see public sector governance being completely modernised. Everyone is in favour of that. It must be fully transparent. It must be absolutely independent in all aspects of public appointments. Such appointments must be made on the basis of objective merit and qualifications following an open and public process, and it must be made entirely free of public control or interference. What this Bill proposes does not meet those standards. The way to go is the establishment of a new public appointments commissioner to regulate a fully independent and impartial public appointments process, including not only senior public service positions but also positions in the management of other areas of the State, whether semi-State or public bodies, based on criteria which are agreed and in the public domain. Unfortunately, this Bill is putting the cart before the horse. The Minister has outlined that we will see the establishment of an independent Garda authority which will be fully independent from all political control and which will oversee the appointment of a Garda Commissioner and assistant commissioners. We need to see that sooner rather than later. I note there is a consultation day on Friday and it is the Minister's wish to see that legislation is brought forward and established as soon as possible. For those reasons, this Bill is ill-timed and, unfortunately, there are aspects of it which my party considers to be ill-thought-out as well.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	Before the commencement of the debate on the Private Members' Bill, I stated that the rent allowance was supposed to be a short-term fix rather than a long-term solution. RAS was supposed to be a short-term fix. The implementation of HAP, as regards what landlords will get it, is very much based on RAS where one can work when paying with rent allowance. The landlord will get the money directly paid to him or her. However, there is a real problem - that there is the same supply. What landlord will go into the HAP when they already have the RAS? Landlords are pulling out of the RAS anyway. It is impossible for tenants who are in RAS to get alternative RAS provision. That is the problem that we have to address. I do not understand why we are not doing so. Even though it formed part of the programme for Government, it did so when the parties in government did not realise the extent of the housing crisis. As Fr. Peter McVerry has said, it is a tsunami. If we had a tsunami tomorrow, we would have to find the money to build infrastructure again to rebuild the city. We are seeing the same in the homeless crisis. It is a tsunami. Where there is a tsunami, we have to find the funding to rebuild homes for those who have lost the roof over their heads. The idea of holding a review in six months is important so that we see whether this HAP is having any impact, as I do not think it will. At the end of the day, the Government is still relying on the market where Mr. Wilbur Ross is pumping money in to supply investment for housing land. He would not be going into that market if he did not think he would get a big return on it. We must be wary about what has happened in the last period of time. Unless the Government addresses the question of housing being market driven rather than there being a strategy and it being provided as a need, we will be looking at more hapless situations, such as this, or further legislation.

Everything that has been said to date indicates that there is a need to be able to review the position to see that it is working effectively because of the consequences for individuals and families if the proposals in the Bill do not have the desired effect the Minister set out. I refer in particular to paragraph (1)(c) of Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment, which refers to "the number of local authority staff required by each housing authority for the optimal administration of the measures under this Part". I repeat the point I made on Second Stage and subsequently, that in my experience local authorities do not dedicate sufficient staff to housing departments in order for them to achieve the optimal outcome in terms of either construction programmes when there was funding being provided or the general effective administration of housing. I put it to the Minister that housing is not a priority for the Government and it has not been a priority for previous Governments.Although I am particularly proud of my own party's achievements in government, I have to say that when we were in government we did not give sufficient priority to housing. As managers and potential managers look at their career paths and how they might build on them, they will see how the number of miles of motorway built through their county may enhance those career paths. The number of community development organisations that are established may also enhance their career paths, as will the number of artistic programmes mounted in a particular county. However, building local authority houses or working on the housing agenda does not seem to positively affect county managers' career paths. The Minister of State should call in county managers and tell them in clear terms that her Department requires a level of achievement and output, as envisaged in the amendment before us which refers to a six-monthly review. Without that level of enforcement, we will not see the sort of results we want. It is more than just a problem for local authorities, it is also a problem for us as politicians. I am convinced that one of the reasons housing is not a priority is because a large percentage of those on the housing list do not vote. Many of them are not included on the electoral register because they move from place to place regularly. They would have to make an effort above and beyond that made by other citizens to ensure they remain on the electoral register. That is one of the reasons they are not the political priority they should be. We hear much more talk about homelessness than about those on the housing list. One reason for this is because many good, worthwhile and admirable agencies, such as the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Threshold, have a particular focus on homelessness. It is their focus that causes the issue to be prioritised to some extent in the national media, whereas the problem of the mainstream of people who require and depend on local authorities to provide housing supports for them does not get the same level of priority. The Minister of State has an empathy and understanding of the issue but there is nothing in this legislation to indicate that sort of feeling is being given effect to. The Minister of State should look positively on the amendment before us and give it the support it deserves.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	456	The Minister of State would be well advised to accept the amendment. The idea of a review might be a handy way to get her off the hook because there is no question that the housing assistance payment or HAP scheme will not work. This might be a good way for it to be reviewed in six months and then quietly ditched. I will not labour the points that others have made, but the private landlord class in this country is motivated by profit, not by housing social tenants. At the moment, private landlords have absolutely no interest in taking on HAP, RAS - the rental accommodation scheme - or any other acronymic scheme. That is because there is a lucrative queue of people elsewhere who are not on social welfare and who can outbid for rent. I disagree with the previous speaker that homelessness is a priority. The priority is to hide it away, sweep it under a carpet and keep people out of sight. The Minister of State should drop her proposal because HAP will accelerate the demise of the Labour Party. She may shrug her shoulders but it used to be a tenet of Labour Party thinking that social housing would be provided for working class people who could not afford to buy a house. The Minister of State is now throwing people off housing waiting lists and putting them onto a HAP scheme. It seems to be a crude way of eliminating potentially 70% to 80% of the housing list at the stroke of a pen. It was argued at the committee meeting earlier that there was some sort of parity between people on HAP and those in a council home, but there is none. People want security of tenure to avoid having to move their children from school to school at the whim of a landlord a year later. It is wrong, therefore, to suggest that it is a decent home. The Bill should be scrapped for another reason. It is appalling to include deduction at source from the social welfare of council tenants and HAP participants. It is high-handed, insulting and penalises the poor. Apart from council tenants and social welfare recipients, no other group has a bill deducted from their income. People are getting into rent arrears due to austerity, all the cuts that have taken place and the increase in fuel prices. It is sad to see a Labour Minister bringing in such a measure. It is something Margaret Thatcher would have dreamed of.

Once this legislation is passed, which I hope it will be before the summer recess, it will give us the legislative base on which to develop pilot schemes in the other seven local authorities. An ongoing review is built in during the course of the pilot phase which is a learning process. On Committee Stage, I gave a commitment to report to the committee at the end of the pilot phase. I will also be reporting back to Government, and generally, on the outcome of the pilot phase. I will be examining it to see if elements need to be changed, including legislative change if necessary. I can give Deputy Murphy an undertaking that at that point, if we need to put an ongoing review process into the relevant legislation, I will do so. The next six months will be a learning process. I have given a commitment both to the committee and the Government that we will come back to examine it fully and to ensure it is doing what is intended. I will not rise to any provocation regarding my own party, but I will respond to housing issues in my role as the responsible Minister. We are not moving towards reliance on private landlords. We are actually reforming the system for people who are already, at least temporarily, reliant on private landlords because of the shortage of supply. I fully acknowledge that there is a shortage of supply. This is not moving a pile of people into a private landlord situation. It is addressing the existing situation, which is that people are living in houses owned by private landlords. They are in receipt of rent supplement with all the negativity attached in that if they are lucky enough to get a job, they will lose their rent support. When we debated this on Second Stage, there was a positive welcome for that element. I hope some people will see some merit in this legislation. I think there is quite a lot of merit in all three elements of the Bill. It is not about moving towards privatising any system; it is about dealing with the current reality, largely because there is an under-supply. I have already acknowledged that there needs to be more regulation of the private rented sector to give more security for tenants.We want to improve the situation for people who are currently in private rented accommodation by bringing it under the local authorities and giving them better rights, particularly with regard to the amount of money they have to pay, and relating it to their income. That is the purpose.  I made homelessness a priority when I became Minister of State. One of my first statements was that homelessness would be a priority for me. I established the oversight group shortly afterwards. It reported and we are acting on its recommendations. This was not because the media highlighted the issue. There was practically no media coverage of the establishment of the oversight group and the earlier stages of its works. It was only in recent months that the media began to highlight this area. I am not acting because of the media coverage; I am acting because it is the right thing to do. We should not tolerate homelessness in a civilised society and a republic. That is something I am determined to address. I am straying off the issue but others strayed and I wanted to respond to their points.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	464	The Minister of State's departmental officials confirmed to the committee today that people in that situation will be off the housing list. She tried to cover over that by saying they can apply for a transfer but one can only apply to a local authority for a transfer if one is deemed to be in overcrowded accommodation or to have a medical priority. One cannot apply for a transfer because one wants to move from private rented accommodation to a council house. It is not even possible to apply for a transfer from one council house to another. That was done away with ten or 15 years ago. In reality, once a tenant is in a HAP scheme - he or she will not have any choice about it in the unlikely event that the council can come to an arrangement - his or her ten year wait on the list will be extinguished. The only basis on which he or she will be able to get a transfer is medical priority or overcrowded accommodation. That is enormous and the consequences need to be monitored. I appeal to the Minister of State, even at this late stage, not to proceed with this provision. In the absence of rent control it is going to be an unmitigated disaster. The disaster has already been unfolding but it will accelerate over the coming weeks. It is not too late to stop this process but if she is not going to halt it at least she can commit to this review to allow us to monitor and assess the damage that will be done by this retrograde legislation.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	465	I acknowledge there is a poverty trap in the rent assistance system which prevents people from going to work. Essentially, they are worse off where the entry level for employment is quite low. I can understand why it becomes an issue. There is no doubt, therefore, that this is a positive aspect of the legislation. However, the biggest negative is that people will be taken off housing waiting lists. I have encountered people who contacted the council because their landlords pulled out of RAS only to be told they had to source their own accommodation. That will be the experience with this Bill. The application of housing policy varies around the country depending on the local authority. The biggest fault line in this legislation is that a tenant is deemed to be adequately housed and will be forced to source his or her own accommodation if the lease concludes. I have asked officials in my own local authority how they think this will play out. There is no transfer list in Kildare County Council. A tenant who is seeking a transfer is on the housing list. This will outsource housing to the private market and turn the housing authorities into housing support agencies. That is the biggest fault with this legislation.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	It is reasonable to suggest a period of six months for monitoring the legislation subsequent to its introduction. I am not clear on how people will transfer from rental supplement to HAP. Many of the 78,000 people who are in receipt of rent supplement are making top up payments. What problems will we face when we come to assessing that in the local authorities? I can see major problems in this regard because some of the rents being paid are over and above what is allowed. Has this problem been encountered in the trial version of HAP in Limerick? Have people reported receiving rent supplement payments that they had to top up? To deem people under HAP as having adequate housing is absolutely mad. It is similar to what happened in 2011, when a rule was introduced stating that anyone signing up to RAS was to be regarded as adequately housed. The same people are now being made homeless. They cannot even find a local authority place because they have been made homeless.  We are doing all of this in the absence of rent control. I do not understand how we are supposed to keep rents at a certain level, and monitor them, when two of my amendments on rent control were ruled out of order. Whether it is tied to inflation or the cost of living, we must develop a mechanism for rent control. It is done in other European countries. The Minister of State's officials and officials from the Department of Social Protection acknowledged that people will end up off the housing list but she has not once acknowledged that people will be taken from the housing list if they avail of HAP. She needs to have the honesty to acknowledge that is going to happen. People will then start to wake up to what is happening.

My area has a high level of social housing and people dependent on rent supplement. Other Deputies have spoken about rent supplement and I also cannot see how this Bill will help the problem, given our current economic climate. The amendment would have the Government examine, after six months of operation, the effectiveness of this new process. It would not tie the Government to an onerous amount of work or contradict the Bill. It would seek to determine if the Bill has the effect that the Minister of State and her officials have spoken about. I do not believe it can do so and the proposed process is not in a format to have such an effect. It is another example of further entrenching the subsidisation of private landlords in this country. Rather than doing this we should try to ensure an increase in the supply of social housing and we should undo the lack of investment evident for quite a number of years with social housing in the country. Spending did not keep pace in the good times or even in bad times, and in the past 20 years we have not properly addressed the social housing issue in a way that dealt with increasing housing lists. That has definitely not been evident in the past three years. I agree with my colleague about rent control, an issue that can and should be considered very quickly so as to address a major problem in this city and, as far as I know, other locations on the island where private landlords are creaming it. The proposed changes will not necessarily attract landlords into a system. This process is modelled on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and a pilot was implemented in Limerick. Examination of the RAS operation in this city demonstrates that it has been a basket case, with the council now encouraging people to stay in accommodation despite it being sold from under them by a landlord. Not only is the city council in breach of its agreement but it is encouraging the tenant to be compliant in such a position. Tenants are frightened that in the morning either bailiffs or other parties could put them out on the street, despite the fact there is a legal agreement between the tenant and the council. The council has not been able to find landlords to take up the RAS in the past few years in this city. This new proposal for a housing assistance payment, HAP, will go the same road, creating more nightmares along the way. It is a disgrace that anybody in these schemes could be taken off a housing waiting list as these are temporary measures. The HAP is a temporary payment and it is not a solution to a person's housing problem.

The HAP is at the centre of this legislation and although the coming into being of the payment is entirely positive, the idea that once a person gets the payment, he or she is taken off a housing waiting list is entirely negative. Does the Minister of State accept that her officials contacted Kildare County Council to indicate that everybody involved with leasing and RAS should be taken off the housing waiting list? Does she accept that her officials contacted Kildare County Council to indicate that when the HAP is introduced, nobody in receipt of the payment should be entitled to continue on a council waiting list? These are simple and straightforward questions.

We have all spoken about the supply issue and I have acknowledged that as a problem.

Before one can even think of applying for a transfer one has to be in a house for two years. The reasons for the transfer would have to be serious anti-social behaviour, violence, overcrowding or some major health issue. One does not have a snowball’s chance in hell of getting a transfer anywhere at the moment because the housing departments are inundated and their priority is to get people into houses rather than transfer people from one house to another. The Minister of State was a bit unsure the last day we debated this Bill but has admitted today that people who go on to the HAP scheme will be knocked off the council housing list. Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government confirmed this at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government. Those people will be council tenants but without the rights of other council tenants who have secure tenure. The Minister of State is right to say they will apply for a transfer because that is all they will be entitled to when they are regarded as being adequately housed. The Minister of State is creating a second tier, yellow pack council tenant. I take exception to the Minister of State’s remark, one that I have heard from council housing officials, that many people are happy where they are and do not want a council house. The people I deal with would give their right arm for a council house. If somebody does not want a council house he or she will be offered two or three houses and will then be knocked off the list. They will not be offered another and will not get rent supplement. I do not know where these people are. Maybe the housing officials actually believe that people want this form of housing. They do not. Many people who would not have seen themselves living in a council house some years ago would now be happy to do so. I was brought up in a council house that was built in the 1970s. It was a way of life for people who could not afford to buy on the open market. I am genuinely dismayed to see the Minister of State breaking with a tradition like that, as a member of the Labour Party. She shrugged when I said we cannot blame the Labour Party for what the Government inherited, the bailout, the lack of house-building under Fianna Fáil, who admitted as much earlier this evening, but we can blame the Minister of State for this. Her name is on it. It breaches an obligation and responsibility to provide council housing.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	507	I remind the previous speaker that the previous Government built up to 44,000 housing units in an eight or nine year period. Let us return to a point where we on this side of the House can agree about what has been said consistently during this debate. It stems from the short-term measures included in this Bill, which we welcome. We acknowledge the need for them but they are short-term solutions for many people who need a long-term solution. The Minister of State has acknowledged that those accommodated by this scheme will come off the housing list. Where they go from there is the problem. The Minister of State says they will go on a transfer list. In all the counties we represent there are fiefdoms, which have different rules and regulations and management structures for the control of lists and how people are transferred. Some people cannot get a transfer unless they have been in a house for a year or two. Some local authorities do not operate a transfer system at all because of the costs associated with it. The Minister of State says she will apply a ministerial order to effect this. How in heaven’s name can she be in her office every second day writing ministerial orders for people who wish to apply for a transfer, when their local authority does not have a system that might accommodate that process in the first instance?  The Minister of State knows well that there is nothing in this Bill to acknowledge the fact that a long-term solution needs to remain available to those accommodated on a HAP scheme. We are all on the same wavelength in respect of this Bill and our amendment. The Minister of State has acknowledged that she wants to get those people on a list. The only way to do that is by accepting an amendment or at least by acknowledging, when she brings the Bill to the Seanad, the efforts many of us have made here today to ensure that long-term housing remains available to anybody on a HAP scheme.  We all know the difficulty the Minister of State has had heretofore in raising funds to address this problem as it was historically addressed, through the provision of housing units. Until local authorities can address the existing difficulties in a meaningful way we will not solve this problem. Meanwhile, there are short-term solutions, as there have been for the past three or four years. We acknowledge the Minister of State’s efforts in that regard. In the interests of conciliation and of serving our purpose here, to help those in need, the Minister of State must play her part in this process and accept some of these amendments in the good faith in which they are proposed. I did not want to have to say what other speakers have said but the Minister of State seems to deny outright and try to disregard everything and anything put before her. I believe she does want to solve this problem and she is disappointed that many local authorities have taken the liberty of taking people off housing lists when short-term solutions are provided. Rather than make ministerial orders, the Minister of State and the officials in the Department should put their heads together and either accept some of these amendments or take cognisance of what we have said because we represent many constituents around the country. We are not making this up. We are all interested in providing solutions. The Minister of State has put forward short-term solutions in the hope of finding long-term solutions soon, through various means. In the meantime, however, she should not deny these people the right and opportunity to have a long-term solution, as everybody on the housing list does.

The HAP is a temporary measure. It is a temporary housing support mechanism. It is a Dublin City Council tenancy with a private landlord who owns the house. It is not social housing because it is not controlled by a local authority or a voluntary housing agency. We are here because there has not been sufficient investment in social housing. The response to the crisis which has been building up in the past five or so years has not been quick enough. There has been a failure to act, to control the market, to ensure adequate supply, or at least some supply that would address the problems. This Bill does not, in any shape or form, address the problems that emerged during the experiment with RAS in this city. In fact, the legislation compounds those problems.I accept the Minister of State's assurance that she will deal in regulations with the whole question of allowing people to get onto the transfer list. Is she giving a commitment that every rental scheme, or every scheme of lettings in every local authority, will address the fact that regardless of whether one is in local authority housing or in the rental accommodation scheme, one must have already passed two years' tenancy before one is allowed to get onto the transfer list? That is the current situation in Dublin City Council. I think it is reflected elsewhere. If the Minister is guaranteeing that people who have been housed with a housing assistance payment will continue on the housing list in their current situation, her approach differs from what is contained in the Bill. In such circumstances, rather than promising that this will be done by means of regulation, it would have been better for her to ensure it is contained in the legislation itself.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	509	I mentioned earlier that Kildare County Council does not operate a transfer list. A person who goes on the transfer list because he or she is unsatisfactorily housed essentially goes on the council waiting list. If they go on that list today, they get the number for today. If a person who has been taken off the list because he or she is deemed to be satisfactorily housed needs to be placed on that list again two years later, he or she will be placed at the bottom of it. Some of these people may well have been on the housing waiting list for seven, eight, nine or ten years. The fairness associated with the scheme of letting priorities is really going out the window under this approach, which means that people are constantly going to the bottom of the list. I suggest that a transfer list should be introduced. As I have said, not every local authority has a transfer list. Such a list has certainly not been maintained in County Kildare for many years. A variety of things will continue to happen throughout the country unless the Government sets a particular standard for them all to follow. I will explain why this matters hugely to people. If the Minister of State asks someone who has been on the housing waiting list since 2005 or 2006 whether going off the list and getting a housing assistance payment would compensate them for losing the hope of ever having a home, she will be told that would make them feel like they are renting someone else's property without retaining the hope of ever having a home. There is a world of difference there. Not all of the consequences of the ongoing use of a system that moves children around frequently can be counted from a financial point of view. The consequences for children of having to move away from the support of schools and things like after-school activities that would be normal in most children's lives cannot be quantified in monetary terms. One of the reasons people in this country buy houses is that they really have no other option if they want security of tenure. We need to have a rental option - a third way - that provides security of tenure for people who can afford it. That is a whole other day's work. I do not think this has been thought out. It has certainly not been thought out from the point of view of the 90,000 people on the housing list, the 30,000 people on the rental accommodation scheme and the people who are going to enter the list when they have their houses repossessed. This particular aspect of the Bill is certainly not acting in their interests. I am not disputing it in so far as it relates to the poverty trap.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	512	I move amendment No. 38:In page 63, to delete lines 31 to 34 and substitute the following:"(2) (a) A housing authority may, if a tenant has refused to pay rent for a specified period of no less than 3 months and has refused to engage with the relevant authority, make a request to the Minister for Social Protection to deduct from net scheme payments the amount of rent payable to the authority by the relevant recipient concerned and to transmit the amount deducted to the authority.".These amendments seek to deal with the hardship that results when rent deductions are made from social welfare payments. They set out what should happen if tenants refuse to engage and call on the Department of Social Protection to give tenants ten days notice before any deduction is made. I am also proposing that a report should be compiled within six months of any deduction. I am very uncomfortable with the idea of moneys that are owed being mandatorily deducted from social protection payments. I recognise that tenants must pay their rent. Evictions on the grounds of rent arrears or non-payment of rent should be avoided at all costs. This method of retrieving owed rent moneys should not be availed of other than in the most extreme cases. I refer, for example, to a case in which someone has owed rent and has refused to engage with the council over a sustained period. This method should not be used to end the practice of councils working with tenants who have fallen behind to reschedule payments through mediation. These issues should be dealt with by means of this very positive process in the first instance. Many tenants have fallen behind on rent at one time or another. Due to the very small supply of social housing, it is the preserve for the most part of the most disadvantaged communities in our society. It can be very difficult for many tenants, especially older tenants, to manage their money. This has increasingly been the case during the recent years of austerity. Many families have had to choose between paying the rent and keeping the light on or food on the table. Countless heads have been kept above water in bad times because such decisions have been facilitated by councils that have shown flexibility. Amendment No. 39 provides that: "No single deduction ... may be made if it would reasonably cause undue hardship or suffering to the tenant concerned or their dependents." Many other deductions are being made by the Department of Social Protection at present. Deductions are being made for the purposes of the household charge and they will be made when water charges come along. Now they are to be made for rent arrears. It goes against all my principles to make this mandatory. People need flexibility when bills come in. They do not know when they are going to come in. They have to make a little sacrifice every now and again, before catching up later. That is the way many people work, whether we like it or not. They have no choice other than to act in this manner. The concept of giving someone the power to make a deduction from a social welfare payment is alien to me. However, it has increasingly been a part of the way this Government has operated. It crept under the radar when it was first brought in and used in the cases of the household charge and the other charges that were introduced. It is very offensive to people to have their control of their own moneys taken from them. The Department is taking more and more control of their moneys. I think it is a really bad way of doing business. This was brought in by the Labour Party, along with its colleagues. I think they got away with murder when they did this in the first place. That is why I am proposing these amendments.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	514	I know the Department of Social Protection has the ability to make a deduction from a social welfare payment if there has been an overpayment at some point in the past. In some cases, the Department goes back very long distances. This section of the Bill allows for a 15% deduction. Can this be applied in addition to another deduction? If there has also been a social welfare overpayment, for example, is it possible that two deductions would be made in such a scenario? Is there a bottom line in terms of the amount of money that people are likely to be left with in terms of a social welfare payment?I referred on Committee Stage to the constituent who approached me regarding his property tax bill and the cheapest method of paying it. If he paid it in the post office, he discovered, it would cost him €1 per month on top of the tax itself. Having concluded that the best approach was to ask for the tax to be deducted from his social protection payment, he was told that this could not be done because it would leave him with less than the supplementary welfare rate to live on. There is something of a paradox here in the context of what is set out in the provisions we are discussing. We are all agreed that people should pay their rent. Moreover, there certainly are people who have a poor record in this regard and must constantly be chased. There are others, however, who inadvertently find themselves in rent arrears. I made the point on Committee Stage that there must be a change in the situation whereby people lose their job in January but their rent payment is calculated on the basis of what they earned in the previous year. Such a person is very likely to run up a debt. While people in that situation might well be in arrears on paper, when it comes to doing a reconciliation the following year and taking into account the reduction in income for the time they are out of work, they may not, in fact, end up with the stated arrears. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to manage money in that situation and for people to estimate what the arrears might be. Instead of an annual review, a quarterly or half-yearly review might be more appropriate. A clarification is required in terms of how rent payments are calculated.

I have argued with the Minister for Social Protection in the past regarding the provision in legislation to deduct up to 15% of a person's social welfare payment in the case of overpayments. Now we have a Minister of State in another Department, who also is a member of the Labour Party, seeking to allow for deductions from social welfare moneys in a way which denies people control. The vast majority of adults are able to manage the few pennies they get from social welfare, but these provisions take any degree of control over their payments from them. There is often a situation where a person faces an exceptional payment such as a particularly high ESB bill, as many people faced following the particularly cold winter the year before last. In those circumstances, some people will put off paying their rent until the following week or month. It is not a practice one would like to see happening all the time but, in the main, people are clever enough to manage their own affairs and willing to endure a degree of suffering on the second or third month to ensure their rent is up to date. The vast majority of local authority tenants have good rent payment records. On the other hand, there are those who make a hames of it and cannot manage their money. Help is available in that situation, and successive Governments have encouraged people to go to the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS. It is a good thing to assist people in managing their finances and put in the types of orders the Minister of State is providing for here to help them. What is not acceptable, however, is to not write into legislation a provision for a compulsory deduction from social welfare payments. That is very much in the realm of Big Brother and it leads one to ask where it will stop. For example, would the value of food or butter vouchers, if they are ever reintroduced, be deducted at source? Will the Government continue deducting until those on social welfare are left without a penny? It is important to note that not all persons dependent on social welfare are in receipt of €188 or more per week - anybody under the age of 22 receives only €100. If anybody on this lower rate is in the HAP scheme, will the €30, €40 or €50 rent payment be deducted from their social welfare? What will they be left with to feed themselves and pay the electricity bill? These provisions have not been properly thought out. There must be some degree of control left to those who are reluctantly dependent on social welfare. It is a sad indictment of this State that we have so many in that situation, unwillingly dependent on social protection payments and the provision of social housing. It shows what a basket case the country has become.

This provision is a step too far and the Minister of State should take the opportunity to withdraw it. I speak regularly to officials in Dublin City Council's rents section and they have been very accommodating of people who get into rent difficulties. Arrangements are made to assist them and when people break those agreements, the council will help them again. It is very rare that people are evicted for non-payment of rent because local authority officials understand the circumstances which render people dependent on this type of assistance. They are the same people who seem set to end up dependent on the HAP scheme because of the failure of the State to provide adequate social housing. Under the new scheme, however, they will not have Dublin City Council to fall back on because the money will be taken at source and they will end up in arrears somewhere else. We have already seen the magnitude of arrears to electricity and gas suppliers. How many people have been cut off in the past two to three years? These numbers are a reflection of the type of crisis and chaos in which people are finding themselves. Many of these are the same people from whom rent payments will be deducted on a weekly basis under these provisions.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	518	I welcome the reversal by the Government of its proposal to impose a guillotine on this debate.Will the Minister of State and the Government seriously consider the fact that quite a number of Deputies have raised very serious questions and concerns about this Bill which should give the Government pause for thought? If the Minister of State, as she indicated, wants to reach a solution over which we can all stand and which deals with this crisis, the Government would be well advised to put back the reconvening of Report Stage for a quite a while and convene some sort of forum, which is not time limited or strictly controlled, where we can sit down and try to come up with something that would work, including discussions about how we could finance long-term social housing provision but also the short-term issues, because we might actually get somewhere. There have been some useful exchanges in this debate and some understandings and illuminations to which all of us have contributed. If we could take that forward instead of being dragooned into accepting this legislation in a few days' time or whatever, we might actually get somewhere. That is just an appeal to the Minister of State.  I would like to make three points on the issue of direct deductions. It is effectively punishing people who are victims of the recession and the economic crisis which have impacted on families in manifold ways - in a whole diverse range of ways into which I cannot even begin to go now where people may fall into arrears. Of course, there are cases of people who are just negligent, who are abusing the system or whatever, but they are a minority. There is, however, a very significant problem of rent arrears which has escalated in recent years and one can absolutely see the correlation between that escalation of the rent arrears crisis and the impact of recession, austerity and cuts in other areas on families and their capacity to pay rents. Therefore, the fact people get into arrears is often because of circumstances completely outside their control. I will give a few examples. One very common example is that many council tenants actually pay their rent ahead. They pay more than their rent as a safeguard against anything ever going wrong. This is very common among council tenants. They pay their rent plus a bit just in case anything ever goes wrong, where they have exceptional needs, a death in the family, an illness or some difficulty which will mean they may not be able to meet their normal rent commitments. Those sort of emergencies and crises hit almost every family at some point in their lives, if not a couple of times. Suddenly, they can find themselves, for a period of six, eight or ten months, not able to meet their normal rent commitments which they have done religiously for all of the period of time they have been council tenants. However, they will be punished under this measure because of circumstances outside their control. That happens often. I will give another common example before I get to specific examples, where somebody faithfully pays his or her rent and declares all income, earnings and all relevant circumstances to the housing department, in terms of the assessment of his or her rent, but the council makes a mistake. This happens all the time. The council assesses the person's rent as being at such a level but a year or even two years down the line, it says, "Sorry, we made a mistake" and although the tenant answered all the questions faithfully, when it looked at their assessment, it saw it should have been charging a higher rent. Over night, through no fault of the tenant, he or she is suddenly told that although they thought they were in the black, they are actually in the red to the tune of €4,000 or €5,000. This happens all the time. I deal with rent sections which say they are sorry they made a mistake but the person has to pay for the mistake and that they will take it directly out of the person's money even though it is through no fault of the person's. I will give another example of a family where somebody in the house has a problem - say one of the principal earners has a problem with drink or something like that but his wife and children believe he is paying the rent and are giving him money to pay it but he is not doing so and they do not know about it. He is culpable and the council has a legitimate case against him. In one particular instance, a couple subsequently separated but the whole family was evicted for rent arrears. Some €12,000 of rent arrears had built up through no fault whatsoever of the children or the wife but they were all evicted. In this case, the money would have been directly deducted from their income even though it had nothing to do with them. That is not fair and this is the problem with what the Minister of State proposes. There will be innocent victims of all sorts of situations which are not the fault of those tenants. Of course, we should help and assist people who may have difficulty paying their rent but the best way to do that is to make sure people are not pushed into poverty. I will give another example, of which I should have thought and which is coming up all the time now. The different quality of council housing means that many tenants, in particular those in older council houses, have to pay much more on heating than tenants in new council houses because there is chronic damp and the houses were built a long time ago and are substandard. A tenant, through no fault of his or her own, has to buy an electric heater because the place is damp. It is really the council's responsibility, and often the council will say it is its responsibility but it does not have the money to dry line the house or to put in insulation, so people have to fork out a much higher proportion of their meagre income on heating the place than somebody who happens to be in a new council house. As a result of the need to keep warm during the winter, people find themselves in arrears and unable to meet all of their rent commitments. They will be hit on the double because the council will say it is now going to grab the money from them, making a bad situation worse. That is not uncommon. There is a lot of housing stock in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and I am sure elsewhere, where there are chronic problems of damp, lack of insulation, cold and so on and where people are forced to spend massive amounts of their meagre incomes on just keeping the place warm, in particular during winter, and let us not forget the fuel allowance has been cut, making that situation worse.  Under this measure, these people will be punished and told that the council will grab a portion of their social welfare payment, pension or whatever. It is absolutely not fair. We must have measures to deal with people who are abusing this but if people are having difficulties, we need compassion, flexibility and housing departments which have the flexibility to actually recognise where some people have got into difficulty through no fault of their own and should not be punished as a result. On those grounds, I ask the Minister of State to seriously reconsider this measure.

The implication is that if one is poor, some kind of a stick is needed to get one to pay up. As we know, the same does not apply to the wealthy. I noted at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government today that it appears a mandatory direct deduction facility is being introduced for HAP as well and not just for rent arrears. I oppose the measure and do not agree with trying to amend this in any way. It is an absolute cheek to dip into people's social welfare payments to pay rent. This seems to be the Government's latest response if people cannot pay. It has introduced deduction at source for the property tax, but it seems only for the poorest in society.  Others have said why people get into arrears. People are in arrears because they are suffering from six years of austerity. These people are at the absolute margins of society. The largest single group in poverty in this country is lone parents. Most of the people on the councils' waiting lists and in council housing are lone parents.A sure-fire way of landing in poverty is to rear a child on one's own. That is why people struggle with rent. Fuel has been mentioned also. Disputes should be also part of the equation. A lot of council tenants in our council area had pyrite problems in their homes. Does the Minister of State consider it right that they had to pay their council rent all through the years of waiting for the problem to be fixed? I do not. A person in private rented accommodation would not have to do so. The people concerned did pay the rent but they would have been justified in withholding it. The key point is that we should not under any circumstances allow such an infringement of people’s civil liberties, namely, that their incomes could be deducted to pay a bill. It is redolent of Big Brother that the local authority and the Department of Social Protection can connive and conspire in that way. I contrast the approach to the treatment given to Denis O’Brien that was publicised last week. He was struggling with his debts and the bank wrote them off to the tune of €300 million. While council tenants will have their deductions taken away from them, the rich at the very top of society escape scot free, as they normally do. The proposal is an outrageous infringement of civil liberties. I am surprised that it is legal for a person to have his or her income cut to pay a bill. I do not know if the system could be challenged on that basis. It is completely wrong because it is punishing the poor for being poor.

In terms of social welfare recipients, I do not believe they should be singled out but two basic principles should be at play. First, where tenants consider it would be advantageous and would assist them in their overall financial management and where they are willing to agree to a deduction at source, that should be facilitated. I would welcome the inclusion of a such a provision in the legislation because it would help many people who have difficulty in managing their finances. When we look at the work of MABS, for example, we realise that there are many people who find it extremely difficult to manage the very scarce financial resources available to them. Whether that is the result of austerity or circumstances that prevailed prior to the advent of austerity is perhaps a moot point. On the proposed amendment which addresses deductions of 15% or 5%, I believe the 5% proposal is reasonable in all circumstances and I urge the Minister of State to take that on board. As we discussed previously, people who are in arrears with their payments, when under pressure, are inclined to agree to practically anything. The deduction of 15% would be excessive and would be likely to give rise to real and sustainable hardship in most families who are in receipt of social welfare payments. The Minister of State has not accepted any amendments to date. I hope she will make a name for herself with this legislation and be brave enough to accept the amendment.

At the end of 2011 the extent of the accumulated rent arrears across all housing authorities was €53.25 million. By the end of 2012 the figure had risen to €56.4 million. Deputy Ó Snodaigh in particular referred to the fact that the majority of tenants do pay their rent. It is a differential scheme so it is based on income. It is not fair to those people who pay their rent that others on the same income with the same family circumstances are not be obliged to pay their rent. Some arrears have been written off as bad debts but the problem is very serious and must be addressed. The effect of the proposed provisions is to meet a person's housing need on a continuous basis by providing a mandatory rental deduction facility whereby a person does not fall into arrears, which would have the effect of reducing financial liability for local authorities for rent arrears. Where a mandatory direct deduction facility is not available, this would also have serious consequences in allowing arrears to develop in the context of creating a poverty trap for the households concerned. In one of Deputy Boyd Barrett’s examples he said the man of the house was not paying the rent but the rest of the people in the house thought he was and therefore they fell into arrears. That would not happen in the case of direct deduction because the money would be deducted at source and the rent would be paid. In reply to Deputy Coppinger who has just left the Chamber, it is important to note that the Office of the Attorney General has agreed with the principle of a mandatory deduction of rents. We did get legal advice. The requirement for accommodation is a basic human need. The office has further advised of no legal impediment to deducting a rental payment at source for the provision of social housing support and in making the tenant or HAP recipient pay the full rent amount on the basis that it is the tenant who enters a binding contract on the provision of support and therefore has a legal obligation with respect to the payment of rent. The same advice also stated that there is no legal requirement to have a limit in place as to the amount to be deducted. There is a clear basis in law that housing is addressing a basic human need and it is perfectly legal to deduct at source. In terms of arrears we also have been advised that there is no legal impediment to the deduction of rent arrears. In response to Deputy Catherine Murphy’s question, the 15% includes the social welfare overpayment so it will not be 15% plus, it will be a maximum of 15%. The scheme is designed to be realistic rather than punitive in terms of representing what a householder can reasonably be expected to pay. In respect of amendments Nos. 39 and 42, in so far as they provide for the Minister for Social Protection to notify the tenant of the authority's request for a deduction in respect of rent or rent arrears, the Minister for Social Protection will facilitate the request for the deduction of rent and-or rent arrears from a social welfare payment on receipt of the instruction from the housing authority. As the information will already have been provided to the customer by the housing authority, it would not be necessary or administratively efficient for a further notification to issue from the Department of Social Protection. In respect of amendment No. 41, as previously advised on Committee Stage, the ceiling in the Bill of 15% of the weekly personal rate of a social welfare recipient for deductions in respect of social welfare overpayments and rent arrears is the same as the ceiling for recovery of social welfare overpayments only in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. As I indicated, the 15% is the overall amount that can be taken. The 15% ceiling was set in consultation with the Attorney General's office as a realistic rather than a punitive limit on the deductions concerned and is considered to be the appropriate limit on deductions that would avoid the social welfare recipient falling into destitution. That is the basis for deductions at source. I have probably addressed the various issues - the debate ranged more widely – in terms of what the amendments contain.

It is the same Attorney General. I disagree with the principle of mandatorily taking money by the Department of Social Protection from those on social welfare payments. We should not do that. The same approach has been used in other areas. People are struggling at the moment. I do not know if the Government is aware of the high number of people who are struggling currently. Many of them have built up rent arrears. I am not proposing that they should not pay it back or that people should not pay a fair rent. Every possible means should be used to get people to pay rent but I do not agree with taking it from their social welfare payments. In some cases people are receiving only €100 a week because they are under a certain age. The proposal is scandalous.If payments were constantly reduced by the Department, even for old age pensioners who have their own house, we would certainly hear a lot more from them and their representatives.
