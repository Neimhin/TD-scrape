#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	Yesterday, the head of banking regulation at the Central Bank, Ms Fiona Muldoon, made a very frank and honest statement in which she outlined what was not being done about the mortgage crisis. We have raised this issue on a continual basis for the past 18 months. Yesterday, it was confirmed that half of the 168,000 owner-occupier mortgage holders in arrears have no formal arrangement in place and the losses already incurred have not even begun to be cleaned up. It was revealed for the first time that 48,000 buy-to-let mortgage holders who are €13 billion in debt are in financial difficulty, and the banks were berated for not acting on the issue. Ms Muldoon called for urgent action and condemned what she saw as bankers behaving like unruly teenagers in dealing with the mortgage debt crisis. She stated there was a lack of urgency of purpose in dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis and that the banks needed to get busy fixing the issue. The Central Bank was very robust in its comments yesterday and was far more assertive than the Taoiseach has been on this issue. Last week, I raised the issue of AIB raising its standard variable mortgage interest rates and the Taoiseach defended the bank and stated he could not intervene. In addition to Ms Fiona Muldoon's comments, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance stated very clearly a much more dramatic write-off of debt was required in respect of households in unsustainable situations and unable to pay. It took a civil servant to say what the Government has refused to say on debt forgiveness for the past two years. It raises fundamental questions about Government policy. What is Government policy on debt forgiveness? With regard to the Personal Insolvency Bill, the Taoiseach proposed the unruly teenagers would have a veto on mortgage debt and the resolution of household debt. It is time the Taoiseach re-examined the Bill and took on board the suggestion we put forward in the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill tabled by Deputy Michael McGrath, which would create an independent objective arbitrator to resolve debt issues between customers and banks. By any yardstick the performance of banks to date can give no one any confidence they will deal adequately, properly or in a sustainable way with customers and people experiencing pain because of the scale of mortgage arrears they are in.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	Last week, at a Dublin Chamber of Commerce function, I stated publicly there was no demonstrable evidence of a functioning banking system in the country and that the banks were not doing enough. Deputy Martin is only too well aware that the Government had to restructure and recapitalise the banks, change the boards and remove the perks. The Government has had regular meetings with the banks through the Economic Management Council. The regulator requires the banks to submit to the Central Bank their forbearance schemes to deal with mortgages and persons in distress covering a range of issues from mortgage to lease, mortgage to let, mortgage to rent and split mortgages. It is a fact that the Government would like the banks to sit down and conclude arrangements in every case on a bilateral basis. This facility is there and the banks have been advised, encouraged and pressurised to do so. I wrote to the regulator last year and advised him that if he needed further powers to act with regard to the banks, the Government would give him those powers. The regulator replied that he did not at that stage require further powers. The Deputy is incorrect to say it was a public servant who first mentioned debt write-off. The Minister for Justice and Equality on Committee Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill made this very point. I note the points made by Ms Muldoon and the Secretary General, Mr. Moran, and the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank. The message to the banks is that they are in a position to sit down and negotiate on a range of areas with persons with personal debt, in mortgage distress or in arrears. The personal insolvency legislation will be in operation by 1 March which means if banks do not settle on a bilateral basis with their clients, these clients will have recourse to new measures to reach agreement on their problems through the insolvency agency. The legislation will allow for debt write-down. Banks have an opportunity. They have been recapitalised and they have been well advised to sit down on a bilateral basis with their clients and I hope they do so. What the public servants said yesterday follows what the Government has been saying for quite some time. It is time to move and demonstrate that their powers, the range of the facilities under the code of conduct and recapitalisation mean they have the capacity to sit down with every individual and work out an individual solution. If they do not do this, the insolvency system will kick in on 1 March.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	They are not doing that. That is the point. The Taoiseach's response is that the Government would like the banks to sit down with their customers but they are not doing so. That is what Fiona Muldoon, the head of banking regulation at the Central Bank, and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance clearly said yesterday. The Taoiseach wrote last year to the regulator and notes what the head of banking regulation and the Secretary General have to say but we have gone beyond noting. Does he agree with what they have to say? Does it not call for a fundamental change of direction and a change in the orthodox approach to banks to date, which is a non-interventionist orthodoxy, articulated by the Taoiseach last week when he said he could not intervene? Given what we are hearing, the regulator is barking very loudly and the Taoiseach is not listening to what is being said. Particularly in the context of personal insolvency, he proposes to give the very people about whom he has just spoken the veto in terms of resolving household debt. That is the point. How could he have confidence in the banking leadership, or lack thereof as articulated by the head of banking regulation? How can he trust that establishment to fairly, objectively and resolutely deal with an issue that is causing immense pain to hundreds of thousands of families across the country when it is making no sustainable effort to deal with it?

It is not I who is saying it has not worked but the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and the head of banking regulation. I ask the Taoiseach to look again at the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 and to remove the veto he proposes to give banks in terms of resolving household debt.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	The banks have been given no veto. Committee Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill was completed in September. As Deputy Martin is aware, the personal insolvency arrangements constitute a mechanism to arrive at a resolution in every case - in appropriate circumstances, debt forgiveness or write-down. If the banks do not sit down with their clients, the client will by law be given the opportunity to go through the insolvency arrangements which, as we know, is complex legislation but which will be in operation from 1 March 2013. Everybody knows the pressure people are under. Quite a number of mortgages have been restructured or rearranged but not enough is being done. This is why the Central Bank required the banks to submit to it what they proposed to do on a timeline basis by September. So they had better do so because the insolvency legislation is moving through the Dáil and will be operative from 1 March.

Déanann daoine teagmháil le mo oifig gach seachtain. Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil daoine ag dul i dteagmháil le gach Teachta sa tslí sin. Tá daoine i bponc de bharr fadhbanna lena morgáistí. Níl cuid acu in ann a morgáistí a íoc. Yesterday, as we heard about and read, Fiona Muldoon sharply criticised the banks for failing to deal with indebted homeowners. John Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, has also called for the banking sector to resolve all the arrears situations. Depending on who one listens to, there are 129,000 families in mortgage distress. The Personal Insolvency Bill 2012, which is the Government's one contribution to this issue, apparently will not be operational until next year and gives the banks a veto over debt write-downs. When the banks were in crisis, the Government and the previous Government gave them €64 billion. When citizens are in crisis, the Government stands off and does nothing. Variable rate mortgage holders in banks which have received billions of taxpayers' money are paying well above the ECB interest rate and, again, the Government has done nothing about that. I have a number of suggestions for the Taoiseach in terms of actions the Government could take in helping citizens deal with this serious mortgage distress. The first is to bring forward legislation to cap mortgage interest rates, the second is to remove the banks' veto from the Personal Insolvency Bill, the third is to ensure that Ulster Bank passes on additional mortgage interest relief to those in negative equity and the fourth is for the Taoiseach to make a commitment that those in negative equity will not be subject to the property tax. Will he announce these steps today?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	Deputy Adams is aware that the Government has made no decisions in respect of the property tax and will discuss the matter in due course. All of the suggestions people make will be taken into consideration before that decision is finally made. I welcome the statement by Ms Muldoon from the Central Bank. The setting up of the mortgage arrears resolution committee has been attended by either Mr. Matthew Elderfield or Ms Muldoon and Mr. Moran from the Department of Finance. I welcome their statements and the fact that pressure is being put on the banks by the Central Bank to whom the banks have reported with their various schemes for dealing with mortgage distress for those with high levels of debt. It is important to say that the strategy here is to focus on people who are not in a position to pay as distinct from those who can pay and continue to do so. Government strategy clearly has to focus on the first group. The regulator must drive this and I wrote to him on the Government's behalf last year telling him that if he required further powers from the Oireachtas in respect of his dealings with banks, he would get them. He was kind enough to respond very quickly to say that he did not consider that he needed further powers at this time.  The Bill being piloted by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Shatter, through the Dáil in respect of personal insolvency and the personal insolvency agency will give clients caught in this trap an opportunity to have a different structure to deal with their mortgage distress or arrears or level of debt if the banks have not been in a position to sit down with these clients and sort it out. I assure Deputy Adams that everybody wants to see people keep the roof over their heads and a resolution worked out. I agree that this is a source of enormous pressure, anxiety and concern for families every day of the week. However, we have inherited a mess which we have now changed in terms of the downsizing, restructuring and recapitalisation of the banks and the requirement of banks to report their schemes to deal with these areas to the regulator. We meet with the banks on a regular basis and tell them that they should now be sitting down with their clients to work this out because the Personal Insolvency Bill is moving through the Houses of the Oireachtas and will become law. At that stage clients will have an alternative method for having a conclusion reached in respect of their mortgage distress, insolvency or debt problems if the banks decide not to do that in the meantime. So it is for them to arrange to have qualified personnel work out solutions, which are all different. The Bill provides those in this category with the opportunity to avail of debt write-downs or forgiveness under the insolvency agency. 
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	18	I am very disappointed with the Taoiseach's answer. The social cohesion of communities and our society is under threat, not least because of the austerity policies pursued by his Government. In this Republic, there are disadvantaged people who never benefited from the Celtic tiger. We have heard reports of what is happening in St. Patrick's detention centre. There are people in rural and urban areas who are totally impoverished. Recently, we heard that 10% of people, including children, are subject to food poverty. This is a mark of our Republic. However, there is now a new shift because, according to the newspapers and what one hears in constituency offices, some of those who never saw themselves as economically vulnerable and who never did anything but pay their taxes, invest in their families and try to buy their homes cannot even put food on the table every day. They certainly cannot pay their mortgages. There are social consequences associated with choices. I have four propositions for the Taoiseach that would deal with these issues. The Government is very clear when it is dealing with the small people. It has no problem cutting home help hours or the carer's allowance, but when it comes to dealing with the big people, the golden circle and big bankers, there is much convoluted verbiage. Will the Taoiseach not just make a commitment now to implement any of my four propositions? He should introduce legislation to cap mortgage interest rates, ensure Ulster Bank passes on the additional mortgage interest relief, deal with the relevant issues through the insolvency Bill, which gives a veto, and commit that those in negative equity will not be subject to the property tax.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	I am sure the Deputy understands the scale of the dysfunctionality that obtained in the banking system a very short time ago. I am sure he appreciates that the restructuring of the banks, involving a reduction from six banks to two pillar banks, the recapitalisation and other changes are important elements of putting in place a banking system that can actually function in the way the country needs. I would like to see Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland operating as private banks doing what they should be able to do for every citizen, with proper systems, efficiency and competency. The fact of the matter is that the State has a share in Bank of Ireland and owns Allied Irish Banks. The regulator, Mr. Elderfield, of the Central Bank of Ireland, has required the banks to submit to him their proposals to deal with distressed mortgages. This includes split mortgages, trade-down mortgages, the restructuring of mortgage payments and forbearance. As a consequence of their having to have made a submission by September, the banks are now required to implement their proposals. This means sitting down with those who are distressed, anxious and concerned and, in some cases, those who simply cannot meet the mortgage repayments to which they signed up with their banks in the first instance. That is the difficulty in many homes, daily and nightly. I and every other Deputy encounters it. This is why the structure is now in place for banks to be able to deliver on a range of solutions for those with distressed mortgages and who cannot pay, as distinct from those who can pay. The Government introduced the insolvency legislation. It is being taken through the House by the Minister for Justice and Equality and it will become operational in March 2013. This will allow a different structure and approach for persons in the categories I have mentioned such that the problem will be sorted to their benefit. It is not a case of the Government standing idly by while this matter boils away and creates even more problems. While it is a matter of major distress for our economy and a cause of a lack of consumer confidence, the process is now clear. The banks have had to submit to the Central Bank their options, which must now be implemented. In addition, the Government is moving on the insolvency legislation.

We have had long discussions with the banks about steps they could take to help persons in mortgage distress. The regulator required the banks to submit to him, by a certain date, their proposals for persons in mortgage distress. I expect that banks will now answer the calls made yesterday by Ms Muldoon of the Central Bank and the comments made by the Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance pursuant to what the Government has been saying, that is, that we need to prove there is now a functioning banking system and that the facilities given to banks are implemented. In addition, we are moving forward with the personal insolvency legislation.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	22	The problem for the Government is that the bankers are being included as part of the solution. They should no longer be regarded as such, as stated by Ms Muldoon yesterday. She said the bankers are in denial such that they deny there is any problem at all. Like Mr. Micawber in David Copperfield, they are looking for something to turn up. Ms Muldoon was saying the banks are waiting and postponing. They are waiting for the economy and housing market to improve. They are waiting for anything to come to their rescue, including the insolvency Bill. However, this will not sort out the problem, which has the potential to make the night of the bank guarantee look like a picnic. This is because the banks involved are not just in denial, they are, according to Ms Muldoon, involved in a policy of "extend and pretend". That means denial but it also means delay and deceit. The Government is trying to involve people, who are well practised in this area, in what it regards and what may well be a logical process of insolvency. The process the Taoiseach has outlined will not succeed if those people and their institutions carry so much influence. We know the bankers have been involved in deceit not just in this matter but in respect of the amount of money they claim is being given to small businesses. They have lied to the Government, the Central Bank and the people. They are pretending that what they had as old loans, including those associated with Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland (Ireland), represents new lending. It is not new lending. The banks are lying about these figures and other matters. These bankers cannot be treated as normal human beings, nor can their practices be treated as normal. This is what Ms Muldoon was saying yesterday. The banks are frustrating Government and Central Bank policy and they are delaying and obscuring. This was echoed by Mr. John Moran when he said the banks would have to recognise that some debts would not be paid. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that State-owned bodies, which are ultimately under his control, are patently frustrating the wishes and designs of his regulator?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	I am most certainly not satisfied with the pace of resolution. As I stated, the Government, when appointed, examined the mess in the Irish banking system, from which capital was haemorrhaging. Some 250,000 jobs were lost and there was hopelessness, despair and disillusionment in many business circles. This is why the Government acted as it did to restructure, recapitalise and reorganise the banks. The Government consulted the Governor of the Central Bank on the regulatory authority and the requirements to regulate banks and have a code of conduct. As a consequence, the banks were asked to submit, before a given deadline, their proposals to deal with mortgage distress, arrears and debt.The Government said that we stood ready to give extra authority and powers if necessary. Only this morning the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation signed off on the partial loan credit guarantee scheme following on from the micro-finance agency, which the Government introduced recently so that small and medium-sized enterprises and those involved in business could get credit. The Government has also promoted very strongly the Credit Review Office, which in a small number of cases has overturned decisions of banks not to give credit to businesses in the first instance. I am not satisfied that the level of engagement for resolution is at the pace that it should be. We have met the banks on a number of occasions at the Economic Management Council. They have been told in very plain English what is the requirement. Banks have responded by saying that they are recruiting individuals who have a competency in dealing with people who are in distress, anxiety and concern. I want to see that happen. In parallel to what can be done today, tomorrow and the day after, legislation will proceed through the House regarding insolvency arrangements, including debt forgiveness and debt write-downs. The banks know that if they do not deal on a bilateral basis with their clients, those people are going to have the opportunity to have a different structure available to them to bring about a resolution to what is causing them so much stress and concern every day.

The Government is unwilling to take sufficiently strong action on this matter. The words used by Ministers and the Taoiseach are to the effect that the banks are "being advised," "being encouraged", "being pressurised" and have been given various advices "in plain English". Bankers do not take advice. They do not listen to encouragement.

The Government should put the boot on the necks of the banks and give them specific instructions. If this means, as Deputy Adams suggested, that legislation must be introduced to ensure Government control over areas where the banks are abusing mortgages and interest rates, it should be done. Will the Taoiseach outline the specific measures the Government will introduce to enable it to force the banks to behave on a day-to-day basis in a manner that is acceptable to it and in the national interest?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	27	The Deputy advised banks himself for a good while over the years. I am not sure that they listened to him in his professional capacity. He talked about putting the boot on the necks of the banks. We rely on external investment into the banks to keep the system moving. This is important as the economy begins to turn around. Banks are regulated, as the Deputy is well aware, by the regulator. We have had interaction with the regulator, who is exceptionally competent in the work that he does. He has required banks to submit to him their proposals on implementing a range of measures to deal with mortgage distress and persons who are in arrears or who have debts. They have outlined these to him, some in a very complex form. The regulator has reported on this matter regularly at EMC meetings. In plain English, banks have been made aware of their requirements and of what the Government wants them to do. In reality, this means that the family that is distressed today because it cannot meet its mortgage repayments for whatever reason will not have its situation sorted out unless the banks sit down with the client - the family, the husband and wife - and set out the range of issues, solutions and options that they want to talk to the family about. Arising out of those discussions can come a solution to the particular problem. If that does not happen, the insolvency Bill will require the banks to deal with the family's particular problem. I would like to think that following these genuine interactions, banks will respond and prove that their activity levels are being seriously upgraded to deal with the number of people who are waiting to have resolutions brought about in their cases. This is in respect of those who are not in a position to pay as distinct from those who can. From this point of view, if the Government receives a request from the regulator that further powers are required, further powers will be given.

It is a matter for the House to deal with the broadening and deepening of our democracy, and I intend to proceed with that. The commitment in the programme for Government goes much beyond simply undoing the damage done by Fianna Fáil to the Bill enacted the last time we were part of the Government. It extends the legislation to a range of other organisations. I welcome the views of the Opposition in that regard and would be very open to amendments. Committee Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill has been concluded and it is expected that Report Stage will take place in the House during the first week of November.

It is expected the announcement will be part of the Budget Statement and the legislation will be subsequent to it. How and when it comes into effect will be a matter to be announced by the Minister for Finance and its interaction with existing legislation will be outlined by the Minister. The location of the national children's hospital is still being considered by the Minister for Health and he has yet to bring proposals to the Cabinet. I am sure that when the Cabinet has made a decision on the issue, there will be a debate in the House.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	93	When I spoke yesterday I detailed the radical transformation in the landscape of the vocational education sector of our educational system. The system in question goes back to 1930, when the first Act was introduced to consolidate legislation from 1899 regarding technical education. It was extended countrywide in 38 vocational education committees around the country.In the 1990s, that was reduced and consolidated into 33 vocational education committees which were directly related to each county, including borough councils and county councils. What we now propose, based on a decision made by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, is to consolidate this infrastructure into 16 bodies. I changed the configuration of those bodies. For example, County Tipperary was going to be divided into two different configurations - one with Waterford and one with Limerick. In the reforms announced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, yesterday, he consolidated the two county councils in Tipperary into one. That logic is followed in what the Bill proposes to do in regard to vocational education. I acknowledge the presence of the spokespersons for Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin and would like to say that, for other reasons, I will not be able to stay to listen to their contributions. They should not take it as disrespect. We will be able to follow up on this on Committee Stage. When the debate adjourned yesterday, I was in the process of describing what the various sections of the Bill propose to do and I had got to the point where I was about to describe what sections 42 and 43 will do. They will provide for the establishment of committees of boards and require each board to establish a finance committee and an audit committee. Sections 44 to 50, inclusive, provide for financial and planning matters, including the setting of a board's annual budget, the preparation of annual service plans, deposit and borrowing of money, fees, accounts and internal audit matters. Part 8 provides for the repeal and transition of certain provisions. Section 60 removes the bar on VEC officeholders having access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal under unfair dismissals legislation. This is an important industrial relations reform because that body of industrial relations legislation was introduced long after the VECs were first established. The original VECs had, in effect, contained their own internal dispute resolution mechanisms. A person who had a grievance had to follow a different path from a person in regular employment who could avail of the well-established machinery for conflict and industrial resolutions, such as the rights commissioners and the Employment Appeals Tribunal. We are now mainstreaming people working in the VEC sector, soon to be the ETB sector. If they have an industrial relations problem, they can avail of the existing State-wide industrial relations machinery rather than go down a narrow path of their own. Consequently, it is also linked to the removal of the sworn inquiry system. Inquiries in process at the time of the Bill's commencement will, however, continue under the existing provisions. The intention of this legislation, which we will be able to debate extensively on Committee Stage, is to give a new kind of regional infrastructure of education delivery in 16 bodies which will be closer to the community, elected representatives and community interests. Those 16 bodies will have critical mass in terms of the skills they will have. We will get into this on Committee Stage, but I would like to see as our education system evolves that the education and training boards will be able, as desired by the other sectors of the education system, to supply support services to the primary and secondary school infrastructure and not just to their own secondary infrastructure and community national schools, of which there are five, although soon to be six. For example, the summer works programme, which primary schools had in the past, required principals, although sometimes managers, to administer and manage, in their own time and their families' holiday time, small works schemes during the months of July and August, all of which were separate contracts. It would be possible and desirable that a summer works scheme could be done for an entire education and training board area. For example, it could be a combination of Waterford city and Waterford county and a summer works programme could be done at the request of the primary school management system and delivered through the management of personnel in the ETB. We have good and positive evidence that we are getting great co-operation. For example, Louth VEC is acting on our behalf as the Department of Education and Skills in managing building projects and giving us additional resources above and beyond what we have in the building unit in Tullamore. A number of amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage and I apologise again to the House for not having them contained in the Bill as it is. I repeat what I said yesterday that I will make those amendments available as soon as I can and in good time, in particular to the spokespersons of the two parties who are present and of the Technical Group, and provide a separate direct briefing on the implications of what is proposed in the amendments should they request it. This system will take time to bed down. It belongs to all of us. it is not a partisan project being run by one side of the House. I want to co-operate as much as possible with everyone involved. Many Members have been members of county councils and, in some cases, members of vocational education committees. That experience and expertise varies quite a lot throughout the country. Being a member of a VEC in a large urban area is very different from what one might experience in an area with an extended large rural population. All of that expertise should be brought to Committee Stage and expressed in a constructive way. I would like to quote a well-known Irish educationalist. In looking at vocational education in Ireland, Professor John Coolahan in his seminal book, Irish Education: History and Structure, refers to two landmark dates. The first was the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in 1899, to which I referred earlier, and the second was the Vocational Education Act 1930. I put it to the House that we are embarked on a similar exercise in constructing a third landmark piece of legislation in this area. I commend the Bill to the House.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	94	I commend the Minister and his officials on their undoubted work over recent months in researching and drafting this Bill and in looking at how best we can structure education and training throughout the country for the future. The Minister referred to two landmark dates in Irish education. I have no doubt this Bill, which is the first since 1930 to really reform how the work done by VECs is structured, will become a landmark one. Importantly and beneficially, it will consolidate nine pieces of legislation encompassing 600 statutory instruments and it will streamline the legislation around the regulation and administration of further education and training. The VEC sector and the work it carries out has a wide impact across our education system. Schools under the direct stewardship of the VECs account for 24% of all mainstream post-primary pupils. When one includes the role the VECs have played in comprehensive and community schools until now, that encompasses an additional 17% of mainstream post-primary students. That shows the impact VECs have had and also the important role the new education and training boards will play in the future. My party welcomes the Bill. We have particular issues in regard to it but we look forward to engaging with the Minister on Committee Stage. This is something initiated by the previous Government which the Minister has grasped and on which he has expanded and brought forward legislation.The setting up of the ETBs must be about providing a better service for users, which is closely aligned with the needs of employers, both locally and nationally, which is cost effective and provides value for money and which is easily accessible for learners in each new designated area. We began the process of rationalising VECs in government and the Bill has potential for improving and strengthening the education and training sector and giving the sector a status of its own by bringing together further education and skills training to become one sector separate from the education system. Until now, education and training has been an add-on to the post-primary sector rather than a strong sector on its own. We believe further education and skills training is a hugely important sector and we welcome any move to strengthen it and give it the status it deserves. Until now programmes had been provided by many different organisations, including FÁS, the VECs, community groups, second level schools and private bodies. We agree with the Minister that there is an urgent need to bring coherence to this fragmented system and to have an integrated sector delivering high quality programmes. There is a need to ensure we deliver programmes that are relevant to the needs of both learners and the economy. It must be ensured that certain aspects of further education and training are not lost with the establishment of the 16 new boards and SOLAS. The Minister must ensure, in establishing the new ETBs, that adult literacy and community and adult education are protected and given the same focus. We have witnessed significant improvements in this area over the years and they must not be lost. In recent times, as a result of the recruitment embargo, seven adult education officer posts have become vacant at VEC level and that has had a detrimental impact on adult education. It is crucial that this issue be resolved as quickly as possible to get the new structure up and running. The OECD PISA results relating to adult education are due out in October 2013 and the Minister will have to take strong cognisance of them. He will need to make sure that the new ETBs can respond to provide adult literacy and learning courses and that an opportunity can be given to those who did not complete second level education or who left the education system without being sufficiently literate. We must also ensure that there continues to be a focus on the provision of apprenticeships and this is not lost with the absorption of FÁS training centres into the ETBs. With regard to the membership of the boards, Fianna Fáil suggested in January during a discussion on the heads of the Bill by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection that it must be ensured no existing VEC would be disadvantaged in the new set up. The Minister should wait to ensure the interests of smaller communities are protected. My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, raised the example of the amalgamation of the Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo VECs because Leitrim has a population of only 30,000 and, therefore, a small VEC. Naturally, people in that county will be concerned about whether they will be fairly represented under the new ETB structure. The Minister has made provision in the Bill for representations in this regard to take into account the needs of smaller VECs that are being amalgamated. I urge him to give this serious consideration. The Minister said the Bill reforms and modernises the governance provisions. However, the proposed membership of the ETBs reflects the same structure proposed in the heads of the Bill presented to the education committee earlier this year, which, in turn, is similar to the current make up of the VECs. While the Minister says the governance provisions have been amended, I would like to him to outline how this will be effected on Committee Stage considering the structure is similar to that of the current VECs. He also said the new ETBs will deliver programmes relevant to the needs of both learners and the economy. However, there are no proposals to include learners in the membership of the boards and there will only be four community representatives. Ultimately, there will be ten local authority representatives as well. I am disappointed that learners are not represented on the boards directly because they should be. Why have they been omitted when the reforms are about providing an improved service for learners? Surely if that is the case, they should be represented directly. I also have concerns that the appointment of parent representatives has been transferred from local to national level and will instead be drawn from national parents associations. I refer to the principle of subsidiarity in that those who make decisions on behalf of the people they represent should be as local as possible. Until now, the selection of parent representatives to many VECs has been unduly costly and administratively cumbersome but I am concerned about decisions being taken at national rather than local level. The Minister should revisit this and engage with the IVEA and parents associations to ascertain how a structure could be put in place, which would allow parent representatives to continue to be selected at local level. I am concerned that they will become too far removed. Another consideration in this regard is where more than two parents associations are in play, the members of the ETB will decide which is selected. A 16-member ETB will have ten members representing local authorities and they will decide who the four community representatives are and, ultimately, who the parent representatives are and that raises issues. Section 28(7)(a) provides that a national association of parents must nominate one man and one woman but this must be revisited. It is a shame that there will be little staff representation on the new boards. The Minister attempted to introduce gender equality by providing for separate panels for staff selection but the Bill does not provide for gender equality in the appointment of staff. I am also disappointed that there is not sufficient emphasis on representation from the business community. The four community representatives will be drawn from a mix of community groups and the business community. However, the Minister stated in his contribution yesterday that he will table amendments, which will require the ETBs to engage regularly with the business community. Ultimately, a key role of the ETBs will be the provision of education and skills training to people living within their communities. That training must be connected to the employment, business and economic development of the area. If there is not sufficient joined up thinking to ensure training meets the needs of business, which, in turn, will be crucial to those being trained because they will come out with qualifications that will make them employable, there could be a fissure in terms of ensuring the boards work the way they should. Unfortunately, that aspect of our education and training sector has not always been as responsive as it needed to be to emerging needs in the economy. There has been an effort at third level, particularly in institutes of technology, to ensure local business involvement in their governance structures thereby linking them to businesses in their areas. Given the role the ETBs will play, this should also be considered for them. I question whether regular meetings will ensure business involvement to the extent that is needed.Perhaps we should consider permanent business representation on the education and training boards to ensure joined-up thinking between education and skills provision and the needs of the wider economy. The Minister outlined the saving he expects from rationalisation and reform of the VEC sector and FÁS. So far, he expects savings of approximately €3.2 million. The current administration costs of 33 VECs is approximately €40 million but the total budget for the VEC sector is €1.1 billion. Savings of 1% amount to €10 million, so in the overall context of spending on the VEC sector the savings amount to one third of 1%. I would have expected a stronger analysis of where savings can be found and the impact on rationalisation, better working practices and better co-ordination of services. We have not yet seen a strong impact assessment. If the Minister has more detail on this, he can comment on where he sees savings and what work has been done to identify them. A welcome development is the incorporation of FÁS into the education and training boards, leading to the 800 FÁS staff in 16 centres amalgamating and joining the education and training boards. That will help to streamline the provision of training and provide a more co-ordinated approach. It will also lead to savings and avoid the duplication that undoubtedly existed in the past. Does the Minister have further detail? I have seen very little detail on the absorption of FÁS into the education and training boards. Perhaps the Minister can publish some of the detail on the progress made. Fianna Fáil supports the broad thrust of the Bill, which is landmark legislation in respect of the education system and how it is provided. It can be a positive measure and it is also important that it becomes part of a reform in respect of how we deal with people who need to be upskilled and how we relate to people who find themselves unemployed, both from the perspective of social welfare and ensuring social welfare is linked to how their training and skills needs are provided for. I look forward to engaging with the Minister and my Opposition spokesperson colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on Committee Stage. I commend the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.

No one could argue but that there are ambitious reforming measures in the Bill. The Minister referred to landmark dates and this will be another landmark item of legislation in respect of education in the State. The scale of what the Minister is trying to achieve cannot be overestimated. We will look to work closely with the Minister, Fianna Fáil and the Technical Group on Committee Stage to ensure the Minister's objectives in this area can be achieved through the legislation. The Minister referred to this comprehensive Bill replacing nine items of primary legislation concerning VECs and, in doing so, providing the basis for the education and training board system. The Minister outlined how we got from 33 VECs to the proposed 16 education and training boards. Some of the submissions during the discussion on the heads of the Bill indicate differing opinions on the ideal number but there is little disagreement that the Bill is an attempt, and has the potential, to ensure the co-ordination and better delivery of education and training across the State. In doing so, we are ensuring we have the potential to put in place modern, streamlined infrastructure to underpin our competitiveness in a rapidly changing education and business environment. For decades, the VECs carried out their role and deserve great credit. The amalgamation of so many VECs into 16 education and training boards presents opportunities and challenges that could be replicated across the wider education system. Like all aspects of education and training in the State, it is important to have a culture embedded in our education and training systems to enable us to meet the challenges and changes in society. No one can argue VECs did not have the culture of change over the decades. The role of the VEC evolved and expanded to meet varying demands. The establishment of 16 education and training boards can be seen as the next step in evolution of further training and education in the State. I am sure the Bill will be passed and it will then be clear the education and training boards will enjoy an enhanced role compared to the role of the VECs. One enhanced role has already been discussed, namely, the absorption of FÁS staff to ensure the delivery of a broad range of training programmes on behalf of SOLAS when that replaces FÁS. The Minister outlined that the SOLAS legislation will follow this Bill.

When the SOLAS Bill comes before the House, it will pass very quickly because most of the groundwork will have been done in this Bill. Both items of legislation are important because they come at a time when the State faces a period of challenging economic reality. Dealing with such reforming legislation tends to make people nervous. What is proposed goes far beyond what is proposed in most legislation. This concerns transforming an entire system and the deliberations on Committee Stage can help to alleviate concerns. Our society must do more to attract the type of industry to help generate the economic growth needed to retain our economic sovereignty. It will also help to develop our home-grown industry.ETBs will have a key role in identifying, prioritising and improving education and training standards which are central to our economic recovery. I agree with the Minister that it is important we work with the major stakeholders to put in place a solid foundation from which to advance the training, education and skills of our citizens. This is even more important at a time when millions of euro are being cut from our education budget. Times like these focus minds. We need a greater vision in identifying and implementing savings across the education sector. We know the forthcoming budget will make further reductions of €77 million on top of the multi-annual cuts announced last year. While we will disagree as to where those savings should be made and we will have that debate when we deal with the budget, we will agree on the need to achieve value for money. Efficiencies that improve and do not damage front-line services should be put in place. We would support any measure to do that. Protecting front-line services and the quality of our education system must be a priority. In that regard, the ETBs will come into their own. They can ensure greater co-operation between a range of service providers within their regions, at least to identify possible savings if not actively help reduce the cost of running schools. That view is shared by the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA. At the IVEA annual conference, Mr. Michael Moriarty, general secretary of the association, said that in the face of the reduction in capitation grants for primary schools, the potential existed to enhance the range of benefits that would be seen under the ETBs. He suggested that ETBs could support stand-alone management in schools with regard to building projects and to getting better deals from service providers. The Minister outlined some of the cost-saving potential for work schemes. These measures all have the potential to reduce the cost of education. These savings must be reinvested in the education system. They must not go towards paying bank debt.

Two weeks ago, the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection heard from a number of patron bodies about the cost of education to parents. The cost of education to many parents and the pressure put on schools to meet budgets is having an effect. Anything that can reduce the cost of running schools, with the savings passed on to parents, is to be welcomed. Deputy McConalogue and I were recently appointed as our parties’ spokespersons on education so we were not involved in the initial discussions by the joint committee when the heads of the Bill were published. I have, however, read the submissions made in the lead-up to today’s debate. They give a great insight, not only into what the Minister is trying to achieve but also into what the stakeholders themselves see as the potential pitfalls and strengths of the legislation. I also acknowledge the work done by the Oireachtas library and research unit.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	101	Any reform of our education system, which involves the reform of public services, must strike a balance between securing efficiencies and making the delivery more effective for learners and more rewarding for those who deliver the services. That must be a priority. The reform of education and training provision must not be exclusively focused on the expenditure side. Adequate provision must also be made for the implementation of the Bill in order that meaningful reform of education and training, which the Bill sets out to achieve, can be realised. This opportunity may not present itself for many years. We should consider this when we debate the Bill. We must always have in the forefront of our minds the holistic approach we want our education system to take in the next number of decades. It is incumbent on us, therefore, to work together to ensure the quality of education needed to meet the needs of an ever-evolving society is always at the forefront of our minds. We will differ as to how we should best achieve this but we must not allow those differences to get in the way of our overall aim, which is a top quality education, training and further education system. The changes that will be brought about by the Bill must be accompanied by a progressive overhaul of the curriculum. I know that work has started, with project maths and the introduction of the new junior cycle curriculum. It is also Sinn Féin's firm belief that the implementation of a renewed national adult education policy with well-defined outcomes must be central to the way we proceed. In the face of spiralling unemployment, it has never been more important to have training and educational opportunities in place that give those who want to upskill an opportunity to return to the workplace. That is one way of empowering people. We must grasp the opportunity to implement the far-reaching reforms contained within the Bill. That is why Sinn Féin will be supporting its passage on Second Stage today. The Irish education and training system has delivered services in an incoherent way because it has been operated by a range of providers. For example, although there are 450,000 people on the live register, there remain significant shortages in certain areas of industry. Much work remains to be done in providing qualified people for the IT sector and in improving multilingual skills. We are not meeting the demands industry places on us. We must address these skills shortages. We must ensure the education and training boards can provide the type of training and education that produces the skill sets necessary to sustain and grow existing businesses and to make the State more attractive for employers. This will mean developing training and learning to meet the growing demands of a number of areas, such as the IT, biopharma, food and agrifood sectors. One of the strengths of the VEC system has been the extent to which VECs have identified with the particular areas in their geographical remit. This brings us back to the question of how many ETBs there should be.There were differing opinions on that in the submissions on the heads of the Bill. The IVEA in its submission, for example, originally opposed the amalgamation of the VECs on the basis that it believed it would not be in the best interests of communities that were served by the current number of VECs to have a reduced number of ETBs. At the other end of the argument the Educate Together patronage body suggested that 16 could be too many and that the figure should be less than that. Whatever about the differing opinions on how many ETBs there should be, there was very little disagreement from all the stakeholders in their submissions that the general thrust of what was trying to be achieved was progressive. The vast majority of the stakeholders saw the composition, if not the number, of ETBs as very much in line with what they are trying to achieve. That is one of the reasons I was a little surprised by the structure of the ETBs in the Bill. The previous speaker referred to the composition of the ETBs. When the heads of the Bill were published, many of the submissions focused on their composition. The Bill was an opportunity to address some of those concerns but, unfortunately and for whatever reason, which I am sure we will debate on Committee Stage, the Minister has decided to stay with what was already produced in the heads of the Bill. The challenge for all of us is to ensure that the people on the committees reflect the diverse needs, interests and skill sets of all the interested groups that are so integral to the make-up and functioning of the boards. That is something we will have to discuss again on Committee Stage. Let us consider the issue of gender balance, which has already been mentioned. The Bill confers regulation making power on the Minister is respect of staff elections. It provides him with the ability to establish gender panels for those elections. However, it is does not require gender equality in the final appointments of the staff, which is something that must be addressed on Committee Stage, especially when one considers the fact that the legislation provides that the parents' group and the community representatives will be subject to gender balance. That should be extended to all aspects of the board. Of similar importance, and this is something on which my party will focus on Committee Stage, is the need to provide a voice to adult learners in the new ETB structures. The role that groups such as the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, the Irish National Adult Learning Organisation or AONTAS and other organisations have played in giving a voice to adult learners must be incorporated into the ETBs. Given that there are only four community representatives on the board, we must ensure that one of those four provides a voice for adult learners. The Government's policies contain targets for increasing adult numeracy and literacy. However, as NALA points out, there must be a more collective and holistic approach to ensure the implementation of a more robust plan when it comes to the integration of numeracy and literacy into further education and training. With forward thinking and planning this can be done relatively inexpensively. Consider the situation where somebody wishes to avail of further training and education by, for example, undertaking an apprenticeship to be a plumber. It is very important that there is some type of system put in place within those training and education courses which improves the literacy and numeracy of those availing of them. There is no point in somebody going on a training course to become a plumber if the person has difficulty understanding angles and measurements. The numeracy and literacy policy must be integrated into all of the training courses and into the further education sector at all levels. That issue must be re-examined. Undoubtedly, this legislation offers the opportunity to implement positive, reforming measures to ensure adult learners are represented on the boards. Not only should they be represented, but we also have a duty to ensure the necessary supports and measures are put in place to enable their voices to be heard at that level. I am sure that much of the debate on Committee Stage will revolve around the composition of the boards rather than the scope and powers they will have. There is general agreement on the latter, if not the former. One submission to the committee emphasised the importance of the ETBs developing effective two-way communication channels with all the stakeholders. The ETBs will have a significant role to play as key partners in formalising structures for gathering local labour intelligence, for example, by identifying local labour skills which are critical to the creation and sustainability of local employment opportunities. This is particularly important for rural areas. They will have an important role in identifying the needs of particular towns, villages and regions, identifying the skill sets that are required and then tailoring the training and education courses to meet those needs. We must work to ensure the ETBs have a common organisational structure in each region which fully supports the management and delivery of full-time and part-time learning programmes and learner support services. This will mean enhancing the current arrangements for co-operation between education and training boards and the business community. There must be very close correlation between what courses will be set and what the needs are. There will be a number of challenges in the Committee Stage debate on this Bill, as I outlined earlier, but there are significant opportunities under this legislation as well. I appreciate the Minister's commitment to provide his proposed amendments in plenty of time to enable us to study them, and also his offer to provide further briefings on the proposed amendments if we require them before Committee Stage. We will probably avail of that. In conclusion, we will support the Bill on Second Stage and look forward to Committee Stage. There are a number of areas on which we wish to focus but there is no doubt that this legislation has the potential to be one of the most reforming legislative measures in the area of further education and training. We will work closely with all parties and none in the House to ensure that what is ultimately passed by the House does what it is meant to do.

I welcome the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who is standing in for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who had to leave. The Minister could not have found a more able and capable stand-in. I believe the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was a Minister for Education in the past, although I am not certain of that. I am delighted to speak on the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012.It is a bold initiative, although there was opposition to it from the VECs. Having been a member of a VEC board for a long number years, and both a member and chairman of the adult education board, I have in-depth knowledge of the work the VEC has done. Ar an chéad dul síos, I pay tribute to all the different members of South Tipperary VEC over the years, particularly the different CEOs and officials. The board of the VEC was completely different from the county council in that it was more like a family. While there were elected members, community and business representatives and representatives from Teagasc, a lot of creative work was done. We should never forget that. In fairness to our VEC and its current CEO, Ms Fionnuala McGeever, her adult education officer, Eileen Condon, and other staff such as Mary Roche and Veronica Crowe, and the team around them, the input they have and the value they have given to people's lives in south Tipperary is immense. I am delighted to see a member of the VEC in the Public Gallery, Councillor Richie Molloy, with a group of carers from south Tipperary. He understands this. The members work hard and this system has worked well. Going back to the 1950s, when there was little educational opportunity, the VEC was the group that took up cudgels. Often they were regarded as the poor relations, called technical schools, and students at the tech were not considered to be the brightest students. The architects, engineers, carpenters and skilled people came out of them when they were needed to build the country. Now it has gone full circle and private schools are better to attend and be seen in, with better marks for the students who come out of them rather than the VECs. Now we are back to basics and back to our shoulder to the wheel. I compliment the Minister and his officials for the work that was done on this Bill and the way they presented the amendments in time and the offer from the Minister to meet the committee and other interested parties to discuss further amendments. It is a good way to move forward. The help people gave to people in education, counselling and advice was immense. The voluntary board members gave of their time week after week and month after month. When amalgamations of schools started some years ago, as happened in my town of Cahir, where three schools were amalgamated into one, there was huge cooperation. The rural people and their local representatives are not afraid of change or to engage with it - 99.9% are anxious to do better for their community and the people they represent. That is their ambition, it is the meitheal idea and Canon Hayes's vision of self-help and realising the potential in every citizen. The VECs have been at the forefront of that through the courses they have offered. Control was from the bottom up, something which is lacking now. The Leader programme is trying to achieve it again but we have moved too much to central control. That is the worry I have about the Bill. It cuts the numbers of education and training boards from 38 to 16 and they will be made up of ten elected members, two parents and four community representatives. We need more than four community representatives because we need businesspeople who have innovative ideas to create jobs, skills and products to get us away from the bricks and mortar. Tens of thousands of people need to be upskilled and retrained. I do not view them as a commodity but they must change focus to suit present demands. The Minister is well aware of the multinationals in the country that are always telling us that they need people with better skills, science subjects, maths and that we are not fit for purpose. One told us boldly lately that if it hopes to create 400 jobs, 300 of them will be filled by people from their home country. That is a massive pity because the IDA, Enterprise Ireland the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have done huge work to secure these investments. It is not much good, however, if we cannot employ our own people. The Constitution enshrines the right to employment and the right to be able to work and earn a living to provide for our families. I must put on record my appreciation of the work done by the VECs. When the newcomers arrived in our country - I do not like calling them foreign nationals - they were welcome. The first bodies involved in training them on language courses and literacy were the VECs. They did tremendous work on a shoestring budget. A huge voluntary effort was made by literacy and language skill teachers. I know people in Cahir who take in five or six foreign nationals every couple of months and train them in English and cúpla focal as Gaeilge. We cannot throw out the baby with the bath water. We must be capable of recognising what was done at that level and never forget it. The VECs have laid down the template for continuing and further education. We might have a new education and training board but we should use the VEC model because it has the path worn. There could be some small adjustments but they have been hugely successful in adult literacy training and integration of new comers. That has been seen at the education awards in the last number of years. At one time there would be no one from outside the country but now there are people from different backgrounds getting awards and being involved. It is so sad much of the time that they are here in communities but isolated, not involved or interacting. The VEC and adult literacy organisers, many of them volunteers, did so much work to integrate those people and it was done unseen and unsung. It should be pointed out that it is recognised. Section 46 on the financing of the boards is vital. Funding is so important now and with the cutbacks being so bad, there must be a facility for borrowing. We were used to signing off overdrafts at the end of the year and then further Estimates would be voted through here. I am not saying it is money from heaven, money is always there but those facilities are carefully thought out and carefully nurtured in the Bill and that is very important.  I have heaped much praise on the VEC but I have one issue of concern. A constituent of mine represents a professional training company that is recognised by the Department of Education and Skills and is fully FETAC accredited. That company believes there is undue interference from the Department of Education and Skills and from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government through Kerry County Council when it wants to advertise training conferences to upskill elected members along with everyone else. It is a professional organisation. Why should any administrator not bring before the boards of the VECs the information the company submits to county councils?There is something rotten in the State of Denmark because it is not acceptable. The procurement laws here should be advertised. When a professional company responds to express its interest in the conference, it is up to members as to what conference they attend. There is an obligation on the two Departments and the officials to ensure a fair playing field and that there is not undue interference for whatever reason. However, there is a reason and registered letters and solicitors' letters have been sent to find it but no replies have been received. I ask the Minister and his officials to convey this matter to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to check out this issue because what has happened is not good enough. Given that we have strict procurement regulations, surely individuals and professional companies, fully accredited, are entitled to advertise and sell their wares. As the notice has only to come to the notice of the vocational education committees and county councils, the elected members can decide where they wish to go and the group from which they wish to receive training. I ask that issue be carefully examined and any wrongdoing rooted out. I commend the Bill and, if possible, will attend Committee Stage and participate fully. I thank the stakeholders who have made submissions. Too often we have public consultations and then changes are made here. We do our best but there is no engagement with the public or stakeholders. An honest attempt has been made by the Department to do so and it behoves the stakeholders to get involved.  I have nothing against Educate Together schools but I do not want any rush to get rid of the Catholic ethos from schools. We have to be a pluralist society and welcome all but I do not want a takeover. Religious orders, while they have been stained with heinous activities by a small minority, have played a major role in nurturing education. It was wonderful that members of all religious denominations sat on the vocational education boards where the discussions were open and transparent. We cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. We know the service they provided and the amount of work they did at little cost. They did it for love of community and society and did not seek reward. It cost much less to run the schools when it was done by religious orders. We now know the full cost of paying for qualified people. It is a huge transition. The same considerations apply to the hospitals and the Health Service Executive. When the hospitals were run by matrons they were much better and there were no layers of bureaucracy. I compliment those religious orders. I have worked on projects with various religious orders who were solely committed to the project and then the furtherance of adult education, Traveller projects and so on. I advise that haste be made slowly in order that we do not end up with a system where those people are hurt and cast aside but with a void we cannot fill which costs quite an amount to address.  I will encourage community groups and community representatives to get involved. The selection of community representatives can be difficult as it can and has been abused politically and enables the larger parties on the vocational education committees to be on the education and training boards. That is not right. There should be no political interference. They should be business people who are willing to give of their time and have the experience and vision and are good community representatives. I look forward to a further discussion.

The Bill deals with an important area. Given the huge levels of unemployment, the new education and training boards and the new agency, SOLAS, will have an important role to play in trying to upskill and retrain large sections of society who have been forced into unemployment as a result of the crisis and need to be facilitated to upskill and retrain in order to re-enter the workforce. It is important that we get the Bill right and that the new structures, when established, genuinely respond to the needs of people for education and retraining to return to the workforce, whether those coming through the post-primary system or adults who require retraining. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned literacy and numeracy, the importance of which is further highlighted in the context of the need to retrain and upskill. Many of those who are without work and want to find a place in the workforce have serious literacy problems. The literacy problem is a real barrier for large numbers of people to find work and contribute to a modern economy that is advancing rapidly. We must get all those issues right and do our best to provide the education and training that people need for a new economy. It is welcome that the legislation and the infrastructure are being rationalised for the VECs, now the education and training boards. The Minister for Education and Skills said this is running parallel to and matching, at some level, what is being proposed for the structures of local government reform and the rationalisation of same. That is welcome and we all understand its importance. In so far as it can deliver savings where there is unnecessary replication of administration that does not contribute to the delivery of front-line services for which the system is supposed to provide, then all of those things are welcome. However, we need to enter a caveat here in that in the current climate the terms "reform" and "rationalisation" are often used to cover over what, in many cases, are cuts. It is important that rationalisation does not become a euphemism for cuts. There is a problem if that is what is it and if we are talking about cuts. I do not have a problem with cutting unnecessary administration nor with cutting the remuneration for chief executive officers in the education and training boards. There will be cost savings at that level because there will be 16 education and training boards as opposed to 33 vocational education committees. The remuneration for the chief executive officers is generous, ranging from €103,000 up to €127,000.It seems quite high we may need to look further at that. I have no problem with making savings at that level, but not if it runs alongside cuts in the education budget generally, with the cutting of capitation grants paid to schools and further cuts imposed on primary schools as a result of the correct decision by the Government to back off on the cuts to DEIS schools. All the restructuring and rationalisation in the world does not mean very much if we are cutting funding and resources to the schools and education services and do not have adequate teacher numbers and so on to provide the education and training that is so desperately required. It is required now more than ever given that an additional 10,000 pupils are joining the education system every year and the numbers unemployed who require retraining and upskilling are significantly greater than they have been at any time in the recent past. Against that background, even holding current levels of resources would be tantamount to a cut in services. However, we have even had real cuts in addition to that. We cannot hope to deliver on what these education and training boards need to do and what the education system in general needs to do unless we stop the cutting agenda overall. Having said that, I still acknowledge the usefulness of legislation to rationalise the structures. We probably had an unnecessary number of VECs, and amalgamations can work. A number of concerns have been raised with me on the issue of workers' rights. The Bill removes a number of the protections that existed in the previous legislation dealing with VECs in the areas of suspension, dismissal, removal from office, and payment for employees, teachers and other staff. The TUI has made it very clear that it is concerned about this and that the protection for workers' rights in the sector needs to be retained. That is a matter that needs to be reviewed as we proceed with this legislation. On the more general issue of cuts and rationalisation, in a number of areas, according to the TUI, the authority that previously vested in the Minister for Education and Skills in the appointment of board members, chief executive officers, and so on is now migrating to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I share the TUI's concern, as it would indicate a cost-cutting approach to the rationalisation rather than one whose starting point is the educational needs of the pupils or service users of the new ETBs. Often the driver behind reform of the health service and in other sectors is not the best interests of the service users or the provision of services but simply the imperative to cut in line with troika targets. Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to issues of procurement, an area on which I am not an expert. A VEC staff member in my area who would probably prefer to remain anonymous recently showed me some documents indicating there is a new regime for procurement requiring everything to go a central body. All items such as stationery for the VECs must be purchased at a central level or through an approved set of providers. He pointed out that this was likely to have a very damaging effect on the local economy in that previously many of these items would have been sourced from small local businesses in the area. In addition, in many cases the prices they now have to pay for these supplies and goods are actually higher than they were when bought from local businesses. This is not true in all cases but is in certain cases. He showed me the documents - I do not know why Deputy Timmins is shaking his head.

I have a real concern that those sorts of measures can benefit bigger suppliers of goods and services to the education system and to the education training boards at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. On the issue of membership of the boards and so on, a number of submissions have suggested that a balance should be provided in terms of staff and parental representation on the boards. In addition there may also be a requirement to have adult learners represented on the boards. I would like to see that done at the expense of politicians. I do not understand why we need so many councillors. I would favour more staff representation, parent representation, community representation and other people who can contribute to have these boards connected into labour issues in the area, the employment prospects in the area and the educational needs of people in the area rather than it being dominated by politicians. Concern has been expressed that the parents' representatives are now to be elected through national parents' organisations rather than directly at school level. I would like to hear the justification for that because it seems to threaten a level of local democracy. The TUI has expressed concerned that section 48 should specifically prevent fees from being charged for the provision of education by the education training boards, with which I agree. I wish to raise a parochial matter which is somewhat tangential. I have been trying to raise this issue for about three weeks with the Ceann Comhairle. It relates to staff in the VEC, many of whom have worked there for ten, 12 or 15 years and who do not have degrees. Even though they are very skilled at what they do in the VECs, because of the recently passed legislation requiring them to have degrees, they are now faced with the prospect of losing their jobs. The Teaching Council of Ireland will not allow them to join the council because they do not have degrees. They are asking that there would be an amnesty for people who worked for many years in the VECs but are now caught because of the new regulations.While it is reasonable for those regulations to apply going forward, there should be an amnesty for those who, having worked in the VECs for many years and with whom management has no problem as they are doing their job well, now face possible job loss because of the new regulations requiring that they have degrees in order to become members of the Teaching Council.

It is hoped it will provide for future developments. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's comment that our new procurement policies have resulted in extra cost to the Exchequer and have impacted on the local economy, it would be strange if that were the case. Perhaps the Deputy would consider taking up the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills or the Minister with responsibility for the OPW in the context of the proposal to introduce centralised procurement. Vocational education committees have developed progressively during the past 100 years. Previously, in my constituency one could only get an education through the VEC in the area and could not up until the late 1960s sit the leaving certificate examination. Many people involved in VECs have made contributions over and above the call of duty. I recall that in the early 1950s the late Mr. Ben Hooper held raffles and events to raise funding for the provision of public transport to the local VEC school in Baltinglass. I recently came across such a raffle ticket. In the early 1950s children in that area travelled 20 to 25 miles on school transport provided privately by the school. I appreciate all the work that has been done in that regard. While as I stated earlier the Bill is not contentious, I ask that the Minister of State take another look at a couple of sections therein, including section 28 which deals with composition of the board. I note that one of the categories of persons precluded from taking up a position on a board is a person who is bankrupt. This is an issue which also arises in the context of membership of this House. It is also one that has come to the public forefront in recent years owing to the economic downturn. Perhaps we need to examine the concept of the honest bankrupt, namely, a person who through no fault of their own becomes bankrupt. This could be a sub-contractor who is beholden to a main contractor who, owing to negligence and so on, becomes bankrupt resulting in the subcontractor, through no fault of his or her own, being declared bankrupt. We may need to consider defining this type of bankruptcy in our legislation. Perhaps this could, as a start, be done in this legislation. As things stand, a person who is on a VEC board or board of management who, through no fault of his or her own becomes bankrupt - people are being declared bankrupt every day of the week - but has a valuable contribution to make may inadvertently be precluded from holding such position. The Minister might also consider introducing a time limit in respect of the duration for which a person may hold the position of chairman of the new education boards. Many of the people who currently hold these positions have done so for many years. I acknowledge that the chairman of the VEC in my home county has done an excellent job for many years. However, I firmly believe there should be a time limit introduced in respect of the duration for which a person can be chairman of a VEC. I ask that the Minister of State and his officials note this with a view to addressing the matter on Committee Stage. Perhaps a five year term or requirement for break in service, following which the person could again take up such position, could be introduced. The same applies in respect of chairpersons of boards of management, although I acknowledge it is difficult to get people to take up such positions. Often it is harder to remove a person from the position of chairman of, say, a local Fine Gael branch or Fianna Fáil cumann, than it is to make that appointment. I am concerned that the same may be happening in respect of boards of management of schools. This is also applicable in respect of persons who hold the position of chairman on more than one school board of management. I do not doubt the ability of those concerned but a person should only be permitted to be chairman of one board of management at a time and for a set period. While the argument could be made that there already exists a facility to make this change, it may not always be possible to do so without the message going out that the person concerned did not do his or her job properly. More often than not, those concerned will have carried out their duties in an excellent manner. It is important this provision is built into the legislation. There are a few other matters with which I would like to deal, including a local matter. The facilities at Coláiste Ráithín in Bray are very poor. While new accommodation has been promised for a couple of decades now based on public private partnership and land made available some ten to 15 years ago, nothing has yet happened. I would welcome if the Minister of State, whom I know has an interest in this area, could progress the construction of a new gaelscoil in the north Wicklow area. Currently, Coláiste Ráithín is housed in an antiquated building with few facilities, if any. I compliment those in the building section of the Department of Education and Skills who are pragmatic in terms of my dealings with them. On school transport, I note that it is proposed to carry out a review of the catchment areas in this regard and that children who are precluded from availing of public transport in particular areas may obtain a subsidised concession ticket. It is hoped this can be progressed in the near future. Another issue of concern to me is that of the art curriculum. As I understand it, the art curriculum for secondary education has not changed in 40 years. The Minister recently provided, owing to recent concerns in regard to literacy and numeracy ability, that subjects at all levels include a literacy and numeracy input. As I understand it - I am open to correction - a teacher of leaving certificate art is now required to include literacy and numeracy as part of the curriculum. I do not understand how literacy and numeracy could be inculcated into the art curriculum. As I stated earlier, the art curriculum has not changed in 40 years. The percentage of people receiving an A or A1 in art is in the region of 1%, which is far less than for any other subject. There must be something wrong if only 1% of students taking higher level art are achieving an A or A1. The curriculum needs to be upgraded. I understand also that teachers are required to prepare notes on 20th century art history as the industry has not produced a textbook in line with the established curriculum. Perhaps it is not monetarily advantageous for it to do so. While I acknowledge that the Department of Education and Skills is not responsible for textbooks perhaps the Minister of State would examine this issue. Another bugbear of mine, which I have not previously raised on the floor of the House, is that of results and the bell curve. I have sought clarification on this issue but have been unable to get it. What I am trying to establish is if the chief examiner of a subject sets a particular percentage of As or A1s that must be achieved in a subject. I have been approached by a couple of teachers who have marked papers for a number of years and who have on occasion had their papers returned to them with a request that they reduce the number of As in their batch. I raised this issue with the State Examinations Commission. The kernel of the response I received was that there are no quotas applied to the number of As or any other grade coming from examinations centres or from overall allocation of scripts to examiners. I would like to know if there is a quota in respect of the total number of scripts. Students taking, say, the agricultural science examination have a right to know if the total number of A1s allocated in that subject is set at 15% and in respect of mathematics is set at 20%.If it is the case, it is an incorrect approach to education because if somebody gets a grade A he or she is entitled to it. If one's answers are 100% correct it is unfair to be given a grade A rather than a grade A1 based on the number of people getting each result. I am gravely concerned there may be a bell curve policy for certain subjects. I suspect it may be based on batches and that the papers which received an A grade because of the batch they were in would have received a B grade if they had been in another batch in a different part of the country. I have sought documentary evidence for this but the response I have received is unsatisfactory. Will the Minister, through the State Examination Commission, establish whether there is a bell curve policy and if so what is it? If there is not, why do 1% of students get an A1 grade in art while 15% or 16% get an A1 grade in home economics or geography?
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	111	As always I have a healthy distrust of centralisation and the closure of established bodies in the so-called interest of progress. I am concerned the consolidation of the VECs - which has seen my county of Longford lose out - and the expansion of the role of the education and training boards will be a case of dividing but not conquering. Not only are there huge implications, some negative, for existing VEC staff, there is a perception and worry that the rationalisation of the number of VECs is being driven by financial consideration rather than long-term gain for primary, secondary and post-second level students. Such a drive can also lead to wanton waste of public money, as in the case of Longford VEC which had €2 million poured into it prior to the announcement it had lost out as the headquarters of the amalgamated Longford-Westmeath body. The cost-effectiveness and central location of Longford VEC were ignored for what was regarded as political expediency. Following the closure of Connolly Barracks, this was another major blow for Longford. The facts as admitted by the Minister defy logic. The annual rent paid for the headquarters in County Westmeath is €118,300 per annum as opposed to the nominal sum of €13.33 for the Longford headquarters. Mathematically it looks like someone needs to do more homework because there are no cost savings in this type of carry-on, particularly given the €2 million spent on refurbishing the headquarters in the centre of Longford. Any reorganisation of training provision needs to embrace the long-overlooked divide between third level university education on the one hand and technical training on the other, and the stigma associated with it. This has been partly dealt with by Deputy Timmins. This needs to be examined at the post junior certificate stage and provision made for technical education for those whose talents lie in this direction. We cannot afford to continue to insist that those who are not suited to academic subjects are forced to be the victims of a narrow system that has only one focus. This is against the principles of many types of IQ, which are now recognised to be way beyond the scope of academic ability. In other words there are many kinds of intelligence. Neither can we dumb down an academic system which, while not perfect, provides as fair an assessment of ability and potential as possible. Academic ability must, in the interest of the recovery of the country, be encouraged. There is nothing logical about penalising excellence. We need to get over the populist idea of one for everyone in the audience and we must accept that not everyone is suited to academic study and that technical ability is also a talent, which needs to be fostered even more. Creating an equal playing field where each child can achieve his or her potential will never be accomplished by dumbing down education to make a standard template accessible to all. Instead we must embrace difference and allow for specialisation. Most importantly, we must provide a system which allows for such specialisation at a very early age. We must encourage excellence in all areas. This must not be achieved by change for the sake of change. To follow foolishly the mistakes of the UK system, which is rapidly back-peddling, on assessment and project work in favour of what we already have, namely a strong terminal examination, would be madness and I am afraid that changes to the current junior certificate will lead to such retrograde steps. In line with most of Europe, we need to embrace technical education and university degrees under the one third level umbrella without differentiation. Any distinctions need to be removed giving equal rating and status to all talents, and equal reward regardless of course focus. When I read the Bill I see a huge focus on finance, potential savings and cost analysis. While essential in the current economic climate, this focus should not be allowed to be the prime driving motivator of change. We are at a crossroads in Irish education and change needs to be made to reflect future requirements. For example, the number of companies in the midlands which cannot get specialist staff to meet their needs and fill vacancies is increasing. In the past year alone, six or seven companies contacted me about their special needs. The outcome has usually been that personnel have been brought in from elsewhere, particularly Canada and the US. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was very helpful in arranging work visas for people in specialist areas. This country should be able to provide people for these jobs. It is important to separate the two main provisions in the Bill. These are legislative consolidation and legislative provision for 16 newly configured bodies under the umbrella of the education and training boards. The first can be regarded as a tidying up provision or, if one prefers, another centralisation. It can be regarded as the necessary updating of legislation. The second is a matter of replacement and as I already said, I distrust replacement for the sake of it. For the legislation to be successful, the long-term gain must be for students who will contribute to the expansion of our economic profile. There is nothing more important for our future than education. It is worthy of investment, and while cost cutting may lead to short-term gain it must not be allowed to impact adversely on our future. We have seen far too much so-called innovation in education which has been detrimental, such as throwing spelling and grammar out the window in favour of creativity. I hope the dissolution of FÁS and the establishment of SOLAS will produce a rational approach to the provision of education and training that will be job centred and student and trainee oriented. However, again there is a risk that too many strands are being centralised and replaced with unknown entities. I have made numerous representations to the Minister with regard to Lanesboro Community College, a school in my area.When the convent closed, the VEC and convent were amalgamated and the resulting school is bursting at the seams. There is a huge shortage of space at this vocational school in County Longford. In fact, teachers have to meet parents in the corridors, which is not acceptable in the present climate. I would plead with the Minister to try and focus on providing additional accommodation because the number of students has increased by 80 since September. There is an urgency to the provision of additional accommodation at Lanesboro Community College in County Longford.

Given that we are concerned here predominantly with the rationalisation of VECs and the work commenced a number of years ago, if we look back at the VEC system in place for the last number of years we can see that, by and large, it has served the State very well. The vocational schools set up in the 1940s and 1950s hugely benefited the communities in which they were established. The VECs took on an enormous amount of additional responsibility in respect of adult learning and second-chance education and the system grew enormously. At the very start, the concept was an excellent one and it grew to where we are today. A number of issues relate to all aspects of what VECs do, ranging from post-primary schools to third level education. In my area, the VEC was asked by the Department to get involved in sourcing a site for a primary school in Kanturk. That was very successful because there were difficulties in getting a site that would be suitable for everybody. The officials in the VEC put in a huge amount of work together with the Office of Public Works to find a resolution. I wish to put on the record that VECs have been involved in primary education in some instances and have been very successful in this regard.  As we come to a decision to amalgamate and rationalise the VECs we should make sure we protect the system and the brilliance of the people working in VECs. Every Deputy engaged in constituency work knows that there are sometimes discrepancies between VECs and different interpretations by particular VECs and bodies in respect of legislation and regulations introduced at central Government level. Over the past five or six years, I have been debating with the Department, a number of VECs and the county council about the awarding of third level grants, particularly for people going on to postgraduate courses, such as PhDs. Some VECs have interpreted the legislation and regulations in a different way to others. We have been going back and forth between the grant awarding body with which I have been in discussions and the Department to find clarification. I will not go into the intricacies of the case on the floor of the Dáil but some of them have different interpretations of when the year began or when the funding was in place. We need uniformity across the sector. We sought information from VECs and grant awarding bodies across the country about their interpretation of a particular rule. The interpretations were completely different. Everybody would say that there is one piece of legislation governing a particular body or there is one piece of legislation that is interpreted in a specific way for the entire country. As we go forward with this new initiative and the amalgamation of the VECs across the country, it is important to have a look at how VECs interpret legislation and regulations.  Since the introduction of free education in the 1960s we have seen the development of community schools. The previous speaker spoke about the amalgamation of schools, which is ongoing in towns where two or three schools are coming together to form one. This is a significant process involving a huge amount of work but, by and large, it is very successful. We have seen comprehensive schools and community schools which sprang up across the country and the good work they have done over the years is second to none. Comprehensive schools, of which there are a limited number, were devised for a specific reason. Apart from the governing structure, they mirror what happens in community colleges. Much work has been done in both mainstream education and evening classes. The care and attention shown by the teachers and management of schools must be regarded with great respect not just in this country but throughout the world. People have benefited enormously from it. Reports written in the 1940s and 1950s argued that one of the best ways of getting out of poverty was through the education system. It took some sectors a significant amount of effort but if one looks at any census going back to the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and indeed back to the late 1800s, one sees the number of people born in this country who emigrated because there was no future for them here.  I know we face challenging and difficult times but one of our greatest strengths is our education system. Some people left school with a dim view of education and elitism about people who were able to access education was prevalent. People have excelled in the private or public sectors who were only able to access education through the community and comprehensive schools that sprang up in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They came up through the free education system. Any analysis of the socio-economic benefit of this trend would stand the test of time. It has been of enormous benefit because in previous generations many families with significant academic ability would not have had the money to pay for education. There is an argument relating to fee-paying schools at the moment but the most important thing is that we support community and comprehensive schools and those schools that have provided an outstanding education to those who, in previous generations, would not have been able to access it.

One matter for regret over the past 40 years is that when new towns were being built to get rid of slums in Dublin and Limerick, houses were built without proper facilities and they forgot about putting a proper education system in place to ensure the new towns were not just housing units. This created a time bomb in west Dublin and parts of Limerick for which society is paying dearly. I hope we do not make the same mistake again. I welcome the Bill. It is important we ensure the new system has all the strengths of the old one and enjoys the goodwill created throughout the vocational education sector, not just in adult services but also in those for people with intellectual disabilities. It is important the VECs ensure there will be uniformity among the grant awarding bodies and that there will not be a system whereby one body can interpret the legislation differently from another. I commend this important legislation to the House and am thankful for having had the opportunity to speak on it.

When my party was bringing forward legislation before going out of government, I was probably one of the few members of that party who objected to the amalgamation of the VECs and the decision to reduce the number of them. I felt a county such as Wexford, with a population of 150,000, needed its own VEC structure rather than having one merged with that in Waterford. The vast county of Waterford extends right to the border of the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock. There will be a lot of long-distance learning if the offices are to be based in Waterford. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, assured us they would stay in Wexford.

It will not be in the best interests of the students and other people in either county. The Bill is before us and what is proposed will happen. Therefore, we may put up with it. The VEC structure served the country well since its inception approximately 70 years ago. I was a member of Wexford VEC for some years. There are eight VEC schools in Wexford, some of which are based in the large towns. There are some very good VEC schools in rural Wexford, as in every other county. They have certainly served their purpose. Perhaps in recent years, the VECs may have moved away from serving the purpose for which they were originally set up, that is, to provide skills to and upskill people who may not have wanted to go to a normal secondary school. Recently, VEC schools have been competing with other secondary schools for students and have more or less moved into the junior and leaving certificate systems. Generally, the VECs have provided a very good service, particularly to the young. The new education and training boards are important because many young people who left school at an early age to work on the buildings during the economic boom, when the pay was high and there were significant incentives, found themselves in difficulty when the bubble burst owing to their having a low standard of education. This is very worrying in my county and, I am sure, many others. There is a high population of young people, now aged 22 or 23, who left school in the mid-2000s with very little education. We are now trying to get them back into the education system. It is very important the education and training boards examine how we can facilitate this. There have been many strands of education and training in recent years. FÁS offered courses and the VECs offered post-leaving certificate courses. Private trainers were trying to re-skill and re-educate young people such that they could avail of job opportunities. I sometimes wonder whether training bodies were very successful because candidates may have been trained for jobs that did not exist. We must now look at matters differently and examine opportunities that may arise in the agriculture, food, marine and wind and wave energy sectors. Some time ago, I wrote to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, about wind turbines, which are being erected throughout the country. Those who want health and safety certificates or to meet the requirements pertaining to the installation of wind turbines have to be sent to England to be trained. I made representations to the chairman of FÁS and the Minister to have such courses offered here. There are certainly job opportunities in this area, as I know from having spoken to those working in the wind energy sector. The latter have stated there are some opportunities for job creation in the sector but that employees need to be skilled and trained. They need to meet the necessary health and safety requirements. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to consider this. Agriculture is expanding and developing, as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020, under which we will see a considerable increase in employment in the food sector. There is a need for upskilling and training and to direct people into this area. There are certainly no jobs in the building industry or associated industries at present, but there are considerable numbers of young people waiting to be upskilled and who want to be retrained. The post-leaving certificate authorities in the vocational schools, in particular, have been doing a very good job in recent years. In Enniscorthy vocational college, there are approximately 300 students doing post-leaving certificate courses. This trend obtains across the county. St. Senan's psychiatric hospital is to close by early 2013. It is a huge building with 100 acres of land attached. I wrote to the Minister for Education and Skills to determine how we could utilise the building. There will not be great demand for it. I suggest that it become the PLC centre of County Wexford. Instead of offering PLC courses in different schools and areas, there should be a PLC centre with 500 or 600 students. At present, the students are spread across the county. The building is ideal and there is a huge tract of land. We should avail of the opportunity rather than locking the building and paying a fortune on security for years to come. The building could be utilised by the Department of Education and Skills. The membership of the education and training boards is of concern to some. There is no opportunity for learners on the education and training boards, nor is there an opportunity for local parents to be on the VECs unless they are already members and are selected. The National Parents Council will have representatives on the boards. Could the system be re-examined to ensure there is a role for local parents? There are parents' councils in all the VEC schools across the county and it is important that parents have an opportunity to be represented on the boards. It is important that business people be represented on the boards. The boards should work very closely with chambers of commerce and business associations in their areas to ensure there is a two-way process. Ultimately, the business people will provide the jobs and opportunities to young people. Sports organisations are very much to the fore in providing young people with opportunities, such as to play hurling, Gaelic football, soccer and rugby. Many of them have first class facilities at their disposal.That they provide facilities for training courses, particularly at night, is important. These facilities should be utilised. My GAA club in Enniscorthy has hosted a vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, centre for the past decade. The partnership between that sporting organisation and the vocational education committee, VEC, is strong. Some rent is paid, of course, but renting from the private sector would cost more. Sporting organisations have a role to play and I hope that they will be considered for representation on the education and training boards, ETBs. Working in partnership, facilities can be provided so that the large number of unemployed and unskilled young people can be trained for current and future vacancies.

He is passionate about the power of education and reforming in his approach to it. Whenever the history of modern Ireland is written, the greatest and most important success story is that of the vocational sector. It has provided the skill set for industrialisation, manufacturing and construction and moved us from being a pastoral society into a modern economy. The VECs were the vehicle for achieving this. They comprised a critical intervention and provided equality of opportunity, particularly in respect of poorer people. They also empowered emigrants. Those who were fortunate enough to have received vocational education prior to emigrating did well abroad. I can cite examples in this regard. They had the wherewithal and capacity to achieve. VECs embraced academic education and took on a new role. The Minister mentioned that 24% of all mainstream secondary school pupils, some 360,000 in total, can be found in vocational schools. The sector makes a significant input into the management of community schools, accounting for 17% of the pupil population. I am proud of the fact that two of my sons are happily and productively attending an excellent community school in Bailieborough, County Cavan, which has a significant VEC input into its administration. The sector has also been successful in terms of post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses, back to education, community education, Youthreach, VTOS, adult education, adult literacy, Traveller education and prisoner education. The Minister has just empowered Cavan VEC to grasp the opportunities provided by the new training boards by purchasing Dún Uí Neill barracks and placing it into the VEC's ownership and control. This will be of great assistance to the Cavan Institute, which provides PLCs and sophisticated academic courses across a range of disciplines. It has links with Dundalk IT and Sligo IT and is avant garde, with one of the largest student populations in the country. I am proud to have been a member of Cavan VEC for several years. The barracks will provide an opportunity for the Cavan Institute to embrace a training role. In this context, I congratulate my colleague, Councillor Madeleine Argue, chairperson of Cavan VEC, its members and the CEO, Mr. Colm McEvoy, on their tenacity in advancing the project and putting us in a position to be able to embrace the legislation and operate it properly. The Bill's significant output will be the new training dimension. The VECs will take over the role of FÁS, its training centres, etc., albeit under SOLAS, the umbrella national agency. The forthcoming legislation on that is imminent. This is the critical new role that the VECs will assume. I am excited on behalf of the VECs, given the potential. We need quality training. Issues arose in this regard under the previous regime. Training must respond to the aptitudes and needs of its recipients. This might seem obvious, but it has not always been achieved. We need proper aptitude testing, one-to-one interviewing, analysis, etc. I agree with Deputy Browne that we must respond to environmental conditions. The challenge of green energy should be embraced. Cavan has significant primary producers of bacon and pork, intensive dairy farming, successful co-operatives and beef farming. The potential for training in the agrifood sector to provide skilled personnel for processing, etc., is considerable and needs to be embraced, particularly in terms of value added products and so forth. Training must respond to the needs of the modern economy and of those being trained. I am confident that this will be the case. It is a good opportunity for the VECs and we look forward to embracing it. Cavan VEC is in a strategic position to do so, thanks to the recent initiative by the Ministers, Deputies Quinn and Shatter. The recent initiatives by the Department of Social Protection and specifically the Minister, Deputy Burton, in interfacing immediately with people who lose their jobs, assessing their needs, etc., are excellent and need to be linked with the VECs' training role. Rigidities should not prevent such dovetailing. People should move into good training immediately. Even if that training incurs a cost, the output will be considerable. I am satisfied with the proposed composition of the VECs, in that there will be ten local authority members, two staff representatives, two parent representatives and four community representatives. The business and agrifood sectors should be reflected in the composition. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, comment on how the four community representatives will be selected? I welcome the legislation's requirement that business be consulted on the drafting of strategic plans. It is important that VECs share services. I was a doubting Thomas as regards moving away from the county structure. I have never had a problem with shared services, rationalisations, economies of scale, etc., but the county structure has worked well. A way to preserve it within the system should be considered. It should not be lost, as the dynamic works. My VEC has used IT effectively in terms of conferencing between schools and the central office and providing payroll facilities to other VECs. The imaginative use of IT and shared services is necessary.There will be a great challenge for vocational education committees, VECs, in the primary education area. There must be a consensual process that can be negotiated and worked through with the church, as the role of the church in education to date cannot be minimised or taken for granted. As a result of demographics within the churches, there will inevitably be a big role for the VECs in school administration at primary level. In my constituency there is an interesting model, with a campus in Monaghan incorporating a primary, secondary and post-leaving certificate school. The VECs will have an exciting role in the primary sector. There was a reference by the Minister to having the summer works scheme administered by the youth education and training boards, which is good. The planning of new schools is important, as we built some shockingly big estates. That is a great indictment of the work of the last Administration and what happened in the past. We did not build schools because there was no requirement on developers to put in infrastructure for schools in new estates. I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence as I was slightly late in starting to speak. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with it, it has become fashionable for every speaker to mention a need in their own area. I would like the Minister's commitment to a new second level school for Kingscourt in County Cavan to be actualised as soon as possible. There are facilities and if the school could get a roll number fairly quickly, it could progress. This is an exciting day for education in this country and I am particularly excited about the new training dimension, where the action will be. That is where we must come up to the plate.

This is essentially a policing issue and the NSMC does not have any role in the matter nor any authority to progress it further. However, I appreciate the seriousness of this issue and believe we should do everything possible to address the risks and concerns caused by dangerous driving on the road in question. Accordingly, I will also ask my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, to look into the matter in conjunction with his opposite number in Northern Ireland. I will also seek to raise the issue at my future meetings with Northern Ireland colleagues.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	124	I thank the Tánaiste for his reply and his recognition of the very serious concerns of the local community. If I travel from Cavan Town to Clones, I must travel into County Fermanagh on three different occasions. There is a serious policing difficulty in regard to particular stretches of that road. I fully realise there are no easy resolutions to these difficulties. The North-South Joint Ministerial Council met the Clones joint policing committee in 2011. At that meeting, they agreed to convene a meeting of all the relevant statutory agencies, both North and South. A preliminary date was set verbally on the telephone for such a follow-up meeting. Subsequently, the secretariat wrote stating that it had made contact with the various statutory agencies, both central and local, and that there was nothing further it could do in regard to convening a meeting. The Tánaiste will accept that by sitting the representatives of statutory agencies around a table, people can outline what they can do and the limits on what they can do. On the evening of the meeting with the Clones joint policing committee, the town clerk, a very conscientious official, and the then mayor of Clones Town Council, Deirdre Kelly, wrote a follow-up letter to the joint secretariat pointing out again the difficulties facing people travelling on that road. There is very heavy volume of ambulance traffic because it is the route between Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital. People living along that road are concerned when these anti-social and dangerous driving practices take place. We all know that much can be achieved by sitting down together instead of by writing to one another. The Garda Síochána has been doing everything possible and I have spoken to gardaí at local level and, through the Minister, at senior level. I appreciate the Tánaiste's offer to raise the issue at the North-South Ministerial Council but I suggest that he puts it to the council to let the secretariat call a meeting of all the interested parties and outline what can and cannot be done. Will he convey to the local citizens in counties Fermanagh, Monaghan and Cavan that we want to see these issues dealt with and that we do not underestimate the worries of the local community?

We are talking about a stretch of road that crosses the Border on a number of occasions. It is being used for speed racing, joyriding and activity of that kind which is clearly hugely dangerous. There is a difficulty enforcing the law because the road straddles the two jurisdictions. It is not the function of the North-South Ministerial Council because law enforcement does not come within its remit. However, it used its good offices to consult the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority and, on the Northern Ireland side, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Regional Development and the Department of Justice. All the stakeholders consulted were of the opinion that this was essentially an enforcement issue and a matter for the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. As I said, I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality. As Deputy Smith is aware, I am in regular contact and communication with colleagues in the Northern Ireland Administration, including the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Minister for Justice, and I will discuss with them the best way to deal with this issue in an co-ordinated way.

I have been pursuing this matter for some time and I want to be able to say to the local community that central government and the statutory agencies, working with the Executive in the North and its statutory agencies, will do everything they can. As other public representatives did, I received communication from an individual who wrote that his daughter was travelling back to her home when, on the Clones-Cavan concession road, a rally car did a doughnut in the middle of the road watched by many spectators. She did not know this was going on full-time on the Border, mainly on the Northern side, and it was touch and go in regard to being a tragedy. It left her shaken and scared on such a long journey. That type of comment has been expressed to me on numerous occasions. We want every possible measure put in place to prevent any tragedy or accident.

It clearly has to be addressed on a cross-Border basis because it is a cross-Border problem. It is not a function of the North-South Ministerial Council and Deputy Smith will appreciate my reasons for not wanting to ascribe to the council law enforcement functions which are not its responsibility but there are ways in which we can deal with this on a cross-Border basis and I assure the Deputy we will proceed to do that.

In the 17 months she has been in custody, she has been held both in the secure all male prison in Maghaberry and more recently in Hydebank Prison, which is a mixed prison. The person concerned is currently receiving treatment in a hospital facility under the care of the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. In the context of the successful devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Executive, the responsibility for the provision of prisoner health care in Northern Ireland lies with the Department of Health, Social Service and Public Safety. This Department, through the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust, is required to provide health care arrangements comparable to those available in the community. In line with long-standing practice in this House, it is not appropriate for me to comment in detail on any person’s medical records or medical condition but, equally, I am keenly aware that genuine concerns have been raised about several aspects of this case in the House on many occasions and I have raised them very frankly with the British Government.As the record of the House will show, I raised this case with former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Owen Paterson, on several occasions and, more recently, I raised the matter with the new Secretary of State of Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers. The Taoiseach also took the opportunity to raise the matter with Secretary of State Villiers when he met her on 2 October. I will continue to raise this case with the British Government and to convey my concerns, which are shared by all sides of this House, to them and to the relevant Northern Ireland authorities.

That is not meant personally against the Minister but we are dealing with a situation where the treatment of Marian Price has been deemed to be tantamount to torture by the UN and the fact that this treatment is being meted to a woman on the island of Ireland means we need to do more. She is an incredibly ill individual and the Minister has outlined her conditions in solitary confinement. Her medical treatment is not the best and does not adhere to various standards. She has been the subject of scrutiny with a constant security watch while in hospital undergoing medical treatment and her health is vulnerable. Given she has been interned for 17 months, the Government needs to do more. This is a serious abuse of human rights and while the Minister has raised it with his counterpart, I would like to hear more about this. A number of Deputies will take a trip to visit Marian Price the week after next. Will the Minister agree to join us on that trip? As a House, we have to raise this issue more frequently.

As I said, I am concerned about this case and I raised it repeatedly with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. When I met the new Secretary of State, I took the first opportunity I had to discuss this case with her. I am due to meet her again in the near future. I have also discussed this with the Northern Ireland justice Minister. I am concerned about the case.

This is an extremely ill woman who represents no danger to the public whatsoever and the longer she is incarcerated in solitary confinement and denied the support she needs, the worse her condition will get. I am fearful that the next time we discuss this issue in the House, it may be too late. I urge the Minister to intervene.

I understand legal submissions were made recently in connection with that and a process is under way. Separately, a charge is before the courts, although that does not appear to be the principal reason she continues to be detained. That has more to do with the revocation of the licence. I have discussed a number of aspects of this with both the previous and current Secretary of State, including the revocation of the licence, the conditions, the woman's health and other issues raised by the Deputy. I assure her and the House that I am giving serious attention to this case and I will continue to raise it with the British authorities and particularly with the Secretary of State.

The relentless construction of settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is undermining the viability of a future Palestinian state. This is unambiguous EU policy and a clear message that Ireland and our EU partners relay to the Israeli authorities in every meeting. The settlement project is incompatible with a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and with the end of the occupation. Recognising that developments on the ground are threatening to make a two-state solution impossible, the Foreign Affairs Council in May adopted conclusions that restated, and in many respects advanced, EU positions on issues such as the Palestinian depopulation of Area C and evictions and demolitions in East Jerusalem. Many of these issues are part and parcel of the settlement project. The conclusions also set out the remedial action we wish to see, primarily from Israel. Clearly, the Council will have to continue to press on these issues and I stressed this point again at the Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week. While I do not support a boycott of Israel or goods produced in Israel, I believe that the exclusion of goods produced by Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories would reflect the illegal status of such settlements under international law. I have not yet made any formal proposal at EU level because I do not believe there is at present any prospect of getting EU agreement for such a ban. However, I expressed the view that if there is no movement by Israel on the issues raised by the EU Council regarding to settlements, the Union should consider the exclusion of settlement products. As the Deputy will be aware, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade has written to me on this issue and I will reply in greater detail shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	138	I thank the Minister for his reply. As he correctly said, what has happened on the West Bank since 1967 is deplorable. My understanding is that settlements have been promoted and expanded under every Israeli Government. Recently, I read that 200 settlements comprise 42% of the land on the West Bank and almost 500,000 Israeli settlers. The Minister referred to the EU resolution agreed last May at the Council of Ministers to recognise the urgency of the situation and to condemn developments which threaten to make a two-state solution impossible. Am I correct that this matter was discussed at the most recent Council meeting? In excess of €100 million in settlement products are imported by the EU annually, although the figures I have seen vary between €96 million and €160 million. I do not know the exact figure but it is sizeable even at the minimum value. Exports to the EU help to make those settlements economically viable and that is not acceptable. If there is not progress and stronger action by the EU, will the Minister ensure this matter will be high on his priority list when he chairs the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming six months?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	139	I can confirm that the Council, which met in Luxembourg on Monday last, discussed the situation in the Middle East and the fact that no progress has been made in talks about a settlement. The Council adopted a strong statement on the Middle East and Palestine at the May meeting and focused particularly on the settlement activity, which is continuing and which is making a two-state solution increasingly unviable. I expressed in strong terms the Government's position on that. With regard to the question of a ban on settlement products, it is difficult to put a figure on it because the goods exported mainly comprise fruit and vegetables.The settlements are mainly dormitory settlements for the rest of Israel. It is not so much an economic producing area in its own right and it represents a very small proportion of Israeli exports. If blocked, the goods go back to the domestic market. I have asked colleagues in the European Union Foreign Affairs Council to return to this issue, consider the decisions taken in May, see what progress, or lack of progress, has been made and examine what further action the European Union can take to enforce the decisions made in May. One possibility in that context is an EU ban on settlement products.

I ask the Tánaiste to ensure the issue remains high on the agenda. Deputy Crowe and other committee members listened to the accounts given by Trócaire at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. One comment was made by a farmer whose land had been confiscated from him on two occasions. He said it was not safe for them and that this was a huge humiliation and loss of dignity. The concerns of those people must be uppermost in the minds of people dealing with foreign affairs issues. A union the size of the EU must be proactive on this important issue.

That will continue to be the case and that is why we pressed hard for a strong statement at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. That is why we took the position that there must be follow through. I have asked that, during our Presidency, we review what was decided in May. On a technical point, the Foreign Affairs Council is now chaired by the High Representative, following the Lisbon arrangements. I am working quite closely with High Representative Catherine Ashton, who has taken a strong personal interest and leadership role in the Middle East peace process.

I have made clear to the House on numerous occasions that all charges against the medical professionals should have been dropped. Given the great concerns and doubts that surrounded the case of the medics from the start, and particularly in light of the well-documented reports of ill-treatment to which many of those originally detained were subject, the Bahraini Government should consider exercising clemency and releasing those medical professionals who have now been imprisoned. Such an act of clemency would also be very much in the wider interests of promoting urgently needed reconciliation and national dialogue within Bahrain. I urge King Hamad and the Bahraini Government to take account of the widespread international concerns that exist and to agree to release those now imprisoned following the verdict in the Court of Cassation. On a more general level, the Government has repeatedly conveyed its concerns at every suitable opportunity to the Bahraini authorities about the human rights situation in Bahrain, including our concerns about the case of the medical professionals as well as that of the respected human rights defender, Abdulhadi Al Khawaja. We have repeatedly raised these cases with the Bahraini ambassador in London and through our ambassador in Riyadh who is accredited to Bahrain. Officials in my Department again conveyed our strong concerns to the Bahraini authorities through diplomatic channels after the Court of Cassation's decision on 1 October upholding the prison sentences against the medical professionals. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Medical Council are independent organisations involved to varying degrees in the education of medical professionals in Bahrain. It is important to distinguish between the involvement of Irish institutions in the education and training of Bahraini medical personnel, which is entirely positive both for this country and Bahrain, and the case of the imprisoned Bahraini doctors. The RCSI, in particular, felt its efforts would be more effective if it engaged in private dialogue with the Bahraini authorities rather than in the public sphere. All the organisations concerned kept my Department informed of their efforts and views on Bahrain. I met the chief executive of the RCSI to discuss political developments and the college's role in Bahrain. I note the RCSI has commented publicly on numerous occasions about the case of the Bahraini medics and urged the Bahraini Government to withdraw the sentences and release the medics. The RCSI has also written to the King of Bahrain asking him to drop the charges against the medics.

The case, which has drawn international criticism, saw nine doctors convicted for their roles in last year's pro-democracy uprising in Bahrain. The uprising did not seek the violent overthrow of the regime but demanded democratic constitutional monarchy and recognition of human rights. Three of those sentenced were doctors trained by the RCSI and were given outrageous sentences, ranging from one month to 15 years, by a military tribunal. A Bahraini independent commission of inquiry later found that, in many cases, those arrested were subjected to serious human rights abuses. These included beatings, blindfolding, handcuffing and beating with wooden planks. The hospital was under lockdown, with nurses beaten. While I commend the RCSI in Ireland on supporting the recommendation for the development of a national reconciliation programme in Bahrain and for offering to assist in every possible way to advance the building of the programme, the question remains why the RCSI and the Royal College of Physicians stood apart from international human rights organisations such as Front Line Defenders, Médecins Sans Frontières, Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights when they condemned the Bahrain authorities. A legal team of Irish human rights lawyers, Ceartas, is examining the RCSI involvement with the Bahraini Government during the 2011 uprising, following claims that the RCSI college in Bahrain, in which the RCSI has invested €60 million, interrogated their students and asked some to sign a pledge of allegiance to the regime. I have spoken to Médecins Sans Frontières and human rights groups and it seems this did happen. Does the Tánaiste have any comment?

It has a student population of 4,000 people and employs more than 850 people globally, 80% of whom are graduates. I am responsible to the House for the response of the Irish Government to the situation in Bahrain. My concerns, the concerns of the Government and the concerns of the Irish people in respect of the human rights situation in Bahrain and the arrest, trial and imprisonment of the medics have been conveyed in clear terms through our ambassador in Riyadh and to the Bahraini Embassy and its ambassador in London.We have also been pressing Bahrain in multilateral forums to undertake human rights reform. At the most recent session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, we raised our concerns about the grave allegations of mistreatment, amounting to torture, of detainees that were documented in the report of the Bahrain independent commission of inquiry and we urged Bahrain to take further steps to implement in full the recommendations of the report of the Bahrain independent commission of inquiry. At the previous session of the Human Rights Council in June, Ireland made a joint statement with 26 other countries urging Bahrain to enhance its co-operation with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. At Bahrain's universal periodic review in May, Ireland recommended that all decisions by the national security courts should be subject to review in ordinary courts and that laws should be enacted to prohibit civilians being tried in military courts.

I accept that he has taken those actions. As we speak, however, nurses and doctors are being intimidated in Bahrain. Some of them did not take part in the protest but merely provided treatment in hospital to people who had been injured in the demonstration. Surely someone must be held accountable if Irish trained doctors are being imprisoned for speaking out against a regime that opposes human rights. I congratulate the Tánaiste on the contacts he has made, but his words seem to be falling on deaf ears. My information, gained in the last number of days, is that nurses and doctors who treated people who took part in the demonstrations are still being mistreated in Bahrain.

I most recently discussed the issue with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers MP, at our meeting of 17 September 2012. This useful exchange of views built on previous constructive dialogue with her predecessor at the Northern Ireland Office, Owen Paterson MP. I have discussed the decade of commemorations with the First Minister, Peter Robinson MLA, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness MLA, including a substantial discussion on the issue at a collective meeting on 16 January 2012. I also invited the First Minister to Iveagh House in March to deliver the Edward Carson lecture. This was one of a number of initiatives supported by my Department to mark the centenary of the Home Rule crisis and the signing of the Ulster Covenant, which also included exhibitions on the signatories of the Covenant in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and an academic conference in King’s College London. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is also in regular contact on commemorations with his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Carál Ní Chuilín MLA, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office. There is a common view among all those with whom I have discussed the issue that the anniversaries arising in the course of the decade should be marked in a manner which respects historical accuracy, promotes mutual respect and understanding and is tolerant of other views. The Government is also committed to ensuring the all-Ireland and east-west nature of our shared history is acknowledged in the course of the decade, and will continue to work with partners in the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government in this regard. I am conscious also that many commemorations over the coming decade will have particular significance for the Irish abroad. During my recent visit to the United States, I took the opportunity to meet with a number of organisations to ensure widest participation in the coming decade
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	147	I thank the Tánaiste for his reply and I welcome the fact that considerable preparatory work is being done at political and official level with regard to commemorations during this decade. The words "respect" and "tolerance" stood out in the Tánaiste's reply. It is important that we have respect and tolerance on both sides. We should not lose our shared history. As an Ulster republican, I am proud of our fight for freedom and of the many achievements in the State that resulted from the activities of that period. Equally, as an Ulster person and an Irish person, I respect the pride that people of a different tradition take in their story. What we share is more important than what separates us. That must be uppermost in our thoughts as we prepare for these commemorations. The period was a decisive one in Irish history. It was also a divisive period. The first major commemoration, of the Ulster Covenant on 29 September, passed off without major incident. As I said at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade last week, some deplorable incidents took place on that occasion when there was aggressive playing of tunes - one could not call it music - outside churches. I hope we can get away from that type of behaviour which could be provocative. None of us wants to see violence on the streets again. We had three nights of trouble in Belfast at the end of August. We do not want to see a repeat of that.

In this decade, which is already under way, we will commemorate the events that shaped our independence in this State and shaped the history of the island for the past 100 years. Respect, mutual understanding and reconciliation must be part of our remembrance of our shared history. It is also important that we recognise that the history of that period is not only one of conflict, politics and constitutions. We must also commemorate major developments such as the labour movement, the women's movement and the cultural renaissance of those years. With regard to 29 September, my Department has maintained close contact with the Northern Ireland authorities in relation to commemorative events. We are present on the ground and monitoring what is happening. I pay tribute to the leadership shown by the First Minister, Peter Robinson MLA, and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness MLA, in the period leading up to 29 September. I share Deputy Smith's appreciation of the fact that those events passed off peacefully.

People must engage in dialogue. Before 29 September, a critical situation was averted by the dialogue initiated by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister with the communities that were involved and by talking about the difficult issues that had to be overcome. This is the lesson that must be learned with regard to other commemorations. Everyone must be involved. The Tánaiste is right. The commemorations are not only about conflict. They are about the history of how we came to where we are, as Irish people. That is as important as the conflict. We have commemorated the Ulster Covenant. A Home Rule covenant was signed about that time. There will not be difficulties in commemorating that. Very important commemorations will take place and we need to involve all sections of our community and give them a say and a feeling of belonging to the commemorations.

The more work and partnership there is between organisations, administrations and statutory agencies North and South, the better.  Respect, tolerance and inclusivity are important in marking these events. The Tánaiste has reminded us of the renaissance in literature, Irish language and cultural activities. It would be worth promoting those and highlighting the achievements of the period and how they have shaped our language and literature and our place in the world.

I know there were concerns, particularly ahead of the events in Balmoral in April and, more recently, on 29 September, and I am very pleased the events passed peacefully. I commend all those who took an active role in working with communities and different interests to ensure that was the case. In a way that has set a headline for the commemoration of events. The events must be commemorated in an inclusive way. I am very conscious of the North-South dimension of all this, which is why I have discussed it with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The matter is part of our North-South dialogue. It is the reason I took the initiative to hold an event in Iveagh House commemorating Edward Carson - the Edward Carson lecture. He was a Dublin man who was born around the corner from St. Stephen's Green, and his associations were with Dublin. The First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, MLA, delivered the lecture. It was a very inclusive event. Representatives of all political parties, North and South, were present, along with a large number of historians and people with an interest in the period. That is the way we should move forward. It is about historical accuracy, respect and remembering. However, it is also about moving forward. In doing so it is important that we widen the canvas. While great events such as the struggle for independence were taking place, people were getting on with their lives. It is important in remembering what happened 100 years ago that we put it in the context of the way in which people lived at that time and the suffering they underwent, be it as a result of losing loved ones in the Great War, in the struggle itself or simply because of the poverty and ill health that was endemic on both parts of the island.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	152	The fuel allowance scheme referred to by the Deputy is a scheme administered by the National Protection Unit, which operates under the Colombian Ministry of the Interior. The purpose of the fuel allowance scheme is to facilitate trade union leaders and human rights defenders using protective vehicles as they carry out their difficult and dangerous work. It is my understanding that the number of human rights defenders covered by the National Protection Unit has increased and that this increase has put pressure on the allocation currently in place for the programmes it manages. This has in turn had the impact of reducing the resources available for the fuel allowance scheme. I encourage the participants involved in the protection programme and the Colombian Government to continue to engage in discussions so as to ensure that this and other aspects of the national protection programme operate effectively. Ireland and our EU partners believe that the safety of human rights defenders and the protection of their rights must be ensured in Colombia, as elsewhere. Support for human rights defenders is therefore a strong element of our dialogue with the Colombian authorities. When I met earlier this year with Colombia’s Vice President, I raised with him the concerns of the Irish Government about reports of human rights abuses and the dangers faced by human rights activists and trade unionists. I urged that the Government of Colombia take all measures necessary to gain the trust and confidence of all of its people in order to support the peace process there. The decision by the Colombian Government in 2009 to treble the budget of the protection programme for human rights defenders to US$47 million was a positive development. I also welcome the establishment last year of the National Protection Unit to manage initiatives aimed at the protection of human rights defenders, trade union representatives, witnesses and other vulnerable groups in Colombian society. I have asked the Irish Ambassador accredited to Colombia to monitor these initiatives and to keep me informed of developments.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 In terms of financial support for sustainable development in Colombia, including with regard to the particular vulnerability of human rights defenders, Irish Aid funding of some €3.5 million has been provided since 2009 to support the work of civil society organisations and Irish missionaries in Colombia. This funding has had a particular focus on human rights, including human rights defenders, and peace-building. Together with EU and UN partners, Ireland will continue to support the efforts of the people and Government of Colombia to bring an end to violence in their country and to secure a sustainable peace which tackles the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict and improves progressively human rights standards.

The peace talks were supposed to start today, but we are now told it will be tomorrow. I thought the Minister might take this question with Question No. 42, which refers to the Patriotic March, involving elements of Colombian society coming together on this issue. I recently met with groups from the region and their concern is that with these key elements coming together for the peace talks they are worried about the signal that will be sent if somebody is injured or killed as a result of the cut in that allowance. The Minister referred to the increase in the number of people under this protection programme. However, that is also a result of the talks. There is tension within Colombian society about these talks. Those who speak out against the Columbian Government, be it a supreme court judge, a human rights activist or a trade unionist, are labelled as supporters of the guerillas, and that in itself puts one in a situation. Any section of society that is vocal on human rights issues is usually labelled that way. I am worried about the impact this cut might have on the historic talks due to be initiated tomorrow. My concern is the signal it will send. Perhaps Ireland, through its ambassador, would wish the participants in the talks well. It is also important, due to the sensitivity of the talks and the pressure as a result, that nobody should use the talks as an excuse to attack those people who are protected under this system.

I raised it with the Vice President when I met him earlier this year. Our ambassador accredited to Colombia has also raised the issue, and that is ongoing. In the EU context, both Ireland and the EU believe that ensuring the safety of human rights defenders and protecting their rights is important. The issue of human rights and the need for Colombia to make further progress is a prominent aspect of the European Union's dialogue with Colombia, particularly in the context of the human rights clauses of the free trade agreement. There is an ongoing, structured human rights dialogue between the EU and Colombia. The seventh session of that took place in Bogotá in July last and in the course of that dialogue the EU raised, as one of its primary concerns, the treatment of human rights defenders. I am aware of the establishment of the National Patriotic Council and the Patriotic March which took place in April to mark its foundation. The CPM movement is a group of civil society groups and activists and describes its focus as being that of achieving peace and social transformation through democratic means. The Irish Government supports representatives of civil society in Colombia in their efforts to address the legacy of conflict through democratic and peaceful means. Indeed, since 2009 the Irish Government, through Irish Aid, has provided non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and Irish missionaries working in Colombia with funding of approximately €3.5 million for projects in Colombia.

Given that Colombia is at this historic crossroads, perhaps there is something the EU can do in this regard. Some people see the free trade agreement, FTA, with the European Union as legitimising the human rights record in that country. People want to see concrete results in that area. I believe the cut in the allowance sends a bad signal, particularly in the atmosphere there at present. Perhaps the Minister would raise it again with his colleagues in the EU and also through the ambassador. This could potentially be a negative step in view of the historic nature of those discussions.

We will pay close attention to what takes place in the discussions in Oslo. I have asked our ambassador accredited to Colombia to continue to raise these issues with the Colombian authorities and to report to me on his observations, conclusions and whatever responses he receives.In so far as the human rights situation is concerned in Colombia and the difficulties faced by trade unionists and human rights defenders, these are a priority for our discussions with Colombia and the European Union's discussions with Colombia. On the free trade agreement, there are those who ask if there should be free trade agreements with countries with human rights issues but the existence of free trade agreements strengthens the position of the European Union to engage on human rights issues. Indeed, there are specific human rights clauses built into the free trade agreements and as far as Ireland is concerned they must be implemented and honoured.

As part of the Government’s trade promotion strategy, Saudi Arabia has been identified as a priority market with significant potential for Irish companies. Currently, Ireland’s trade with Saudi Arabia amounts to almost €900 million per annum. I very much welcome the establishment of the Irish-Saudi Arabia Business Council, as a joint venture between it and the council of Saudi chambers of commerce and industry. I believe it will provide an avenue for practical and useful assistance to Irish companies seeking to break into the Saudi market. The council will also offer real potential to further develop trade links and enhance business opportunities for companies in both countries. The Irish-Saudi Arabia Business Council was formally launched at a ceremony in Riyadh in June attended by the Irish co-chair of the council, Mr. Joseph Lynch, and his Saudi counterpart, Mr. Abdullah Al-Mohty, president of the council of Saudi chambers of commerce and industry. I understand that preparations are continuing for holding the inaugural session of the council either later this year or in early 2013.  Ireland and our EU partners have an active discussion with Saudi Arabia within the framework of the EU-Gulf co-operation council on a wide range of issues, including human rights. The EU also regularly raises with Saudi Arabia its concerns about the use of the death penalty in the kingdom and encourages the Saudi authorities to further consider ways to reduce the application of the death penalty that could lead to a de facto moratorium on executions.

Will Irish businesswomen be involved in the council? I accept it is important to open new markets and the Tánaiste mentioned the €900 million of trade but we must also take into account the human rights situation of citizens not just in Saudi Arabia but in Bahrain, where the Saudi Government is the power behind the throne. The sectarian nature of society in both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is also worrying. How is that taken into account when opening up these accounts? When sectarianism was a factor in governing the North, many foreign Governments and companies took the McBride principles into account. Do we work to any set of principles when dealing with regimes in this part of the world?

Our relationship with Saudi Arabia encompasses a range of issues including both trade promotion and human rights. The total level of trade with Saudi Arabia stands at €900 million annually and that is very much tilted in Ireland's favour. Our merchandise exports amounted to €527 million and service exports amounted to €303 million in 2011. Imports from Saudi Arabia amounted to €51 million so the balance of trade is very much in Ireland's favour. There is significant growth for Irish exports to Saudi Arabia and our trade with Saudi Arabia grew by 18% last year. The Irish-Saudi Arabia Business Council is an independent body that receives no funding from the State and is the coming together of the chambers of commerce to promote trade and business activity between the two countries. The growth of that trade activity does not compromise or change our view of human rights issues, which are universal. The building of trade relations gives us an enhanced opportunity to engage on human rights with the countries concerned.

She was right to do so. Sadly she has not done the same in Saudi Arabia and it would be a good lead on the part of the Irish Government to raise the issue because the role of women in Saudi Arabia leaves so much to be desired. It would be great if the Irish Government took a lead and challenged the Saudis on this.

It is heavily loaded in favour of the money with very little adherence to the concerns raised about human rights and the systematic discrimination experienced by women in particular and the Shia minority, and the stifling of peaceful protest by the regime. Clearly the Saudi regime benefits enormously from its export and import relationship with Ireland, it is not paying us the money for nothing; the product we send over is good so we should use any links we have to highlight the disgraceful nature of the system there. I am not getting any impression from the Tánaiste's remarks that is happening but the money seems to be a lot more important than any human rights abuses.

It is worth €900 million at a time when we have a huge number of people out of work in this country. We have suffered an economic difficulty and must trade our way out of that. That means we must export and this is an important export market. It is overwhelmingly in our favour, running at €850 million in exports and €50 million in imports. Our commitment to human rights and the rights of women is among the best in the world and we do not equivocate on that or compromise on it. Those rights are universal and it is our view that expanding our trade relationship provides us with an opportunity to engage with countries on human rights issues.

The Israeli navy operates three submarines bought from Germany, with a further two understood to be under construction. The report in Der Spiegel alleges that these submarines have been adapted to carry nuclear armed missiles. The Government has no means of assessing the truth of these allegations. Israel, of course, has consistently refused either to confirm or to deny that it possesses nuclear weapons. EU member states operate one of the strictest export control regimes for military equipment anywhere in the world, using a set of criteria set out in a 2008 Common Position. Each member state is responsible for adhering to these rules, and I expect them to do so. Ireland strongly supports, and is working to advance, UN efforts to achieve a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. A major conference on this objective is due to take place in December in follow-up to the resolution agreed, and in the negotiation of which Ireland played a prominent role, at the 2010 NPT review conference. I hope very much that this can become a reality and that no Middle Eastern state will retain such weapons.

The underlying worry is nuclear weapons. There are sanctions against the Iranian authorities in regard to the potential of nuclear weapons. There is a strong view around the world that the Israeli Government has nuclear weapons. I do not know the position of the Irish Government and whether it believes the Israeli Government has such weapons. Why would the Israeli Government need submarines? Will the submarines be used to establish further the illegal embargo in the state of Palestine? Does the Tánaiste believe such a military deal should have happened considering Israel's constant breaking of international law and human rights? Recently, 79 parliamentarians from across this island signed a petition opposing the blockage of Gaza. The Tánaiste is on record as saying the blockade should be lifted. The Israeli Government receives €3 billion worth of aid from the US, most of which is military. That the German Government appears to be supplying the submarines is ratcheting up the conflict in the area. Does the Tánaiste share those worries?

That is why we support the conference on a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East which is due to take place in December. The conference facilitator, the Finnish Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Jaakko Laajava, has undertaken substantial consultations with all the states in the region in advance of convening the conference. These consultations are ongoing. It was Ireland that brokered the deal at the 2010 review conference of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which set out a number of practical steps to implement the 1995 resolution on a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East. We are available and committed to assisting Mr. Laajava in any way we can in the lead up to and during the conference. The European Union will arrange a seminar in November as part of its activities in support of the conference, and Ireland will be represented and actively participate. There are European Union rules and a Common Position which define the rules governing the control of exports of military technology and equipment by member states. I expect all EU states will honour the terms of that Common Position.

I wish the December conference well. This part of the world is crying out for solutions. I accept the Government has been positive in its role in this area. This is a retrograde step by the German Government. Whatever about the historical involvement of the Germans supporting the Israelis in respect of their existence, this is a negative step. I am appalled they have gone down this route and that the submarine will be used as part of the illegal embargo. I have no doubt once submarines are commissioned, they will be used, possibly against Irish citizens trying to break the embargo.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	168	I am sure the Tánaiste is aware that by 2003, only three of the 193 member states of the UN were not signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation agreement, The three who were not signatories were Israel, Pakistan and India, all of whom possess nuclear weapons and who have been rewarded rather than punished for same. Israel receives more American economic and military aid per capita than any other state, yet the watchdogs of the International Atomic Energy Agency appear to turn a blind eye to it. It is frightening that Germany does not appear to be concerned about the consequences of its policy in providing hardware that could be used for atomic purposes. Under Germany's own guidelines, it is not supposed to export to a state where there is a crisis. Surely, we must agree there is a crisis in the Middle East and Israel is at the centre of it. The Minister said he is not in favour of a boycott of Israeli goods, but he is in favour of boycotting Iran. Despite its denials, we know Israel is in possession of nuclear weapons, but we do not know if Iran is in possession of such weapons. I do not say we should not boycott Iran, but there should be a boycott of Israel. Deputy Smith made a similar call today. In 2009, the Tánaiste called for a suspension of the Euro Mediterranean Agreement with Israel in view of the Goldstone report. It would be good to see some consistency. It is not good enough for us to turn a blind eye to what Germany is doing.

There is a European Union Common Position in respect of the export from all the member states of equipment for military purposes. The armaments companies in the European Union must comply with one of the strictest export control regimes in the world. There are eight separate criteria. They take into account the effect that any arms transfer could have on the country of final destination. The factors assessed include the human rights situation on the ground, the existence of tensions or armed conflict, the preservation of regional peace, the question of whether the export could affect sustainable development of the importing state, the risk of exported military technology or equipment being diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions. The operation of that Common Position is kept under constant review by member states in light of changing circumstances and individual buyer countries. Ireland strongly supports the Common Position and we expect it to be fully implemented by all member states. I assure Deputies that, in our discussions with our EU partners, I will continue to make that position clear. The Common Position applies to all member states. When the EU has agreed a Common Position, all member states ought to comply with it.

The crisis in Syria dominated discussions when I attended the UN General Assembly in New York last month. I made clear when I addressed the General Assembly on 28 September that what is happening in Syria represents an affront to humanity with indiscriminate violence, which is not just confined to one side, taking place on an appalling scale. There is a widespread feeling of despair and frustration at the continuing violence and the seeming inability of the United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, to act decisively and stop the slaughter of the Syrian people. I continue to believe that a strongly worded Security Council resolution under Chapter VII imposing a comprehensive arms embargo remains an essential step to halt the violence and cut off the flow of arms. The immediate priority must remain the earliest possible ceasefire and the initiation of some form of political process leading to transition. Ireland and its EU partners continue strongly to support the mission of the UN-Arab League joint special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who clearly needs the active co-operation and support of all in the region and major international actors, such as Russia, if he is to have any chance of succeeding in his mission. Syria was extensively discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg on Monday. The EU has, of course, been playing a prominent role in efforts to stop the violence in Syria and in providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance. The Council adopted strongly worded conclusions once again warning about the dangers of further militarisation of the conflict, expressing full support for the endeavours of the joint special representative, Mr. Brahimi, and recalling the moral imperative to step up assistance in order to alleviate the suffering of the thousands of refugees and internally displaced Syrians. The Council also adopted a series of further sanctions in a continuing effort to compel the Assad regime to halt the bloody repression it is inflicting on the Syrian people. The Council also emphasised the importance of ensuring full accountability for the very many crimes and serious human rights abuses committed in Syria. Nationally, Ireland continues to support the many calls which have been made for the situation in Syria to be referred by the Security Council to the International Criminal Court as the best means of guaranteeing accountability. A major preoccupation in the Council’s discussions was the heightened tensions now existing in the region, following the appalling shelling of the Turkish border town of Akcakale on 3 October by the Syrian army and the subsequent impounding of a Syrian Airways aircraft at Ankara Airport last week. I have already strongly condemned the attack on Akcakale in a statement I issued in my role as OSCE chair on 4 October where I urged the Syrian Government to end all violence and to respect fully the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all neighbouring countries. I also offered my condolences to the families of those killed and to the Turkish people. I have not had an opportunity to discuss with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr. Davutoglu, or with the Turkish ambassador the deplorable attack on Akcakale or the recent escalation in tensions between Turkey and Syria. However, what is clearly most required at present is restraint on all sides and a recognition that the crisis within Syria will only deepen if it is allowed spread out into the wider region. This was also very much the sentiment at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg and it is a message that I know the EU High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and all EU representatives, including myself, will continue to emphasise in our contacts with all sides involved in the conflict.

I welcome his statement at the United Nations General Assembly and his pursuing of this issue with his colleagues at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council. Every conflict is frightening, but the awful tragedies, including the mass murder of so many people, we see on our television screens every day is particularly frightening. I understand that approximately 30,000 people have been killed in just over a year since the protests erupted. The following quotation is attributed to the international charity Save the Children:As Syria’s civil war has intensified, thousands of children have died in brutal attacks and many more have been injured, traumatised or forced to flee their homes.Boys and girls continue to be killed, maimed and tortured. These appalling violations against children must stop and those carrying them out held to account.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	174	It is very difficult to quantify the number of people who have been killed owing to the restricted access. I have seen figures of 22,000 and up to 30,000, as the Deputy mentioned. Some 300,000 Syrians have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries. Approximately 1.5 million Syrians in Syria are in need of sanitation, food and medical aid. I discussed the humanitarian situation in Syria with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, when I attended the UN General Assembly in New York. Immediately after this session today, I will meet the UN Under Secretary General, Baroness Valerie Amos, who has responsibility for the delivery and co-ordination of humanitarian aid and we will be discussing what needs to be done there. Ireland has contributed approximately €2.25 million to various UN and NGO bodies which are working on delivering aid. The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, went to the region in August. He was in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan and saw at first hand the conditions under which people fleeing Syria are living. We are committed to working with the UN and humanitarian agencies to deliver humanitarian aid to those people, but of course we need to get an end to the violence and a resolution to the problem. To do that I believe we need a UN Security Council resolution. Last Sunday before the Foreign Affairs Council we had a very frank discussion with the Russian Foreign Minister about what needs to be done to secure a UN Security Council resolution.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	175	I have previously spoken on the matter of high loan refusal rates and the detrimental effects they were having on the recovery of SMEs which is vital for the country. At the time, it was suggested that banks were putting already pressurised businesses into further decline by withdrawing their overdraft facilities and restructuring these loans into term loans. Banks, on the other hand, were stating that their means of restructuring loans were in fact helping SMEs to continue to operate but yet again, the opposite seems to be the case. A fuller and far bleaker picture has emerged in the latest numbers presented by the Central Bank. These figures exclude lending for property or to financial firms and are accepted as being a good measure of access to business credit. According to the Central Bank, lending to small businesses dropped by more than €500 million in the second quarter of this year, which is very disappointing. This latest decline represents a fall in lending of €1.9 billion to small and medium-sized enterprises in the 12 months up to the end of June 2012 compared with the same period last year. The financial squeeze applied now has tightened so much that total lending to SMEs now stands at just under €40 billion, with just €459 million of that figure accounting for new loans made in the three months to the end of June. Furthermore, the independent organisation working in support of the Irish small and medium-sized enterprise sector, ISME, had already indicated that half of all applications for business loans were being turned down by the banks, prior to the release of the figures from the Central Bank. The picture becomes even bleaker. We already know that a high percentage of SMEs have restructured loans on their books with little or no access to loan or overdraft facilities from the banks. All of this evidence puts a major question mark over the targets set for the AIB and Bank of Ireland to provide €3.5 billion each in new loans to small business this year. Clearly these targets are not being met on the ground. Once again it begs the question, if banks do not lend to small business and offer real support in these economically turbulent times, how can we seriously expect our economy to recover and grow?For example, the recent report by the Credit Review Office states it has overturned 96 cases in respect of which banks refused credit. According to that office, which reviews lending by Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland to small and medium businesses, 813 full-time jobs and 46 part-time jobs have been secured and an additional €9.6 million has been loaned by the banks. The report also states it will be a challenge for the two pillar banks to reach their lending targets of €3.5 billion each to small and medium firms in 2012. The Credit Review Office report also states that a significant amount of the lending is a restructuring of existing loans rather than new lending. Some of these loans were originally provided by Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland Ireland, both of which are winding down. Mr. Trethowan has expressed grave concerns about the length of time taken by the banks to process loans and instances banks declining potentially viable loans, with the effect of devastating the owner of a firm or farm. While current Government initiatives are helping to address some of the problems faced by small business, if the pillar banks continue to minimise credit which SMEs need to remain viable, this sector will diminish to an unprecedented level. The banks must start lending to encourage growth in our economy. Without it, SMEs cannot and will not survive.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14560	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	176	I thank Deputy Butler for raising this issue. As a Government, we have moved decisively to restructure the banking system and ensure that it provides credit to the economy every year. We are also acting to fill gaps where specific market failures exist. The Deputy will be aware that the Department has introduced two targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit for small businesses into the economy. I attended the launch of the credit guarantee scheme this morning, which was presided over by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. The guarantee scheme will go live next Wednesday, 24 October, and is expected to provide an additional €150 million per annum in lending for small businesses over the next three years. Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the scheme. The guarantee scheme is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable micro, small and medium-sized businesses in two specific situations, namely, where businesses have insufficient collateral and where businesses operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar. It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. Each €150 million of additional lending under the scheme is expected to benefit over 1,800 businesses and create over 1,300 jobs. Another important initiative developed by the Department is the €90 million microfinance loan fund to address access to credit and support lending to the most vulnerable cohort of our SME sector, namely, microenterprises. Microfinance Ireland was launched on 27 September and has been open for business since 1 October. It will provide loans primarily to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. Loans will be for amounts of less than €25,000 and will be generally provided for business start-up costs, expansion costs and working capital. The thrust of the lending policy will always be focused strongly on the potential sustainability of the business, its ability to repay the loan and the creation and maintenance of jobs. It is intended that the fund will provide loans to some 5,500 microenterprises over time, resulting in the creation of approximately 8,000 jobs at a cost of approximately €2,500 per job, which is extremely good value for the State's investment, when referenced against foreign direct investment. To assist medium-sized business, we introduced the €150 million development capital fund scheme earlier this year. This will assist in increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the so-called equity gap experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in excess of €2 million. The development capital scheme is aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, Irish businesses with significant prospects for growth and job creation. Typical companies expected to benefit are those with in the region of 60-160 employees. Further work with the banks is continuing to adapt to the needs of the non-traditional sectors, such as the technology and emerging sectors. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth, including start-ups, early stage and mature companies and to adopt cash flow lending as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years. Knowledge sharing is ongoing, including reciprocal secondments from Enterprise Ireland directly into the banks, sector briefings and trade mission involvement. In addition, the Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention. I refer the Deputy to pages 68 and 69 of the third progress report, which speaks further to the issue raised by him.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	177	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I welcome what is being done by Government, including the roll-out of the new credit guarantee scheme today and the introduction of the microfinance loan fund. However, Ms Fiona Muldoon, director of credit institutions and insurance supervision at the Central Bank, said that she believes a culture of leadership is missing in Irish banks. The secretary general of the Department of Finance also said that banks, in terms of lending decisions, are looking for miracles to happen and are closing shop, waiting for the Central Bank or Government to bail them out or for a national recovery. I am visited every day at my constituency office by people operating small and medium-sized businesses who have obtained a structuring of their loans by the banks and are repaying these loans. However, because they are outside the original terms of their overdraft or loans, this is viewed as a mark against them in terms of getting further loans. The Irish Credit Bureau dealt with only a minuscule 760 cases because the banks will not even give out application forms for credit. If one cannot get an application form, one cannot be refused. Many of the banks will not even answer telephone queries from small and medium-sized businesses. I was recently visited by a gentleman from Navan who employs nine people in his factory. Despite that he is paying his way, has restructured all of his loans, has €200,000 on his books and could employ ten extra people tomorrow, he cannot obtain finance. The Irish Credit Bureau served its purpose during the Celtic era. However, it serves no purpose now. It is not fit for purpose in a recession.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14560	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	178	It is hard not to agree with the points made by the Deputy in relation the banking sector. A distinction must be made between businesses seeking to restructure loans in order to survive and retain their viability and loans generated for new business. I refer the Deputy to the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the third progress report which states that the Department of Finance published the SME lending demand survey in July. That survey of 1,505 companies shows that during the six month period surveyed demand for credit remained low, with only 38% of SMEs requesting bank credit between October 2011 to March 2012. The full survey and findings are available on the Department of Finance website. I take on board the points made by the Deputy in relation to the person referenced specifically by him. I believe the Taoiseach addressed that point today during Leaders' Questions. This is about driving new relationships between Enterprise Ireland and the pillar banks.The Economic Management Council has already indicated it will meet the pillar banks before the end of the year. There is no question that there is a sense the banks are not coming forward with proposals based on a lateral view of how to solve the problems of the person referenced by the Deputy who may have a viable business. The Government is trying to press home this point to the banks. There is a role for the Economic Management Council. The two initiatives, on micro-enterprises and the partial loan credit guarantee scheme, will create a new pillar of lending and will be government backed. This will have a knock-on effect on the SME sector of the economy.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	179	I welcome the opportunity to discuss this very important issue on the floor of the Dáil. It is projected that the Presentation Convent national school, Millstreet, County Cork, will experience huge growth by 2014 or 2015. At present the enrolment figure is approximately 240 and it is projected this will rise to 289 in September 2013 and to 340 by September 2016. It has received one extra mainstream classroom teacher, but its immediate problem is a shortfall in accommodation, and a mainstream classroom, a language room and a resource room are required. In 2007 and 2008 the national school received a grant to purchase two prefabricated classrooms. At the time, the board of management thought it would have been very bad value to accept money for prefabricated classrooms, so it applied to the Department to be allowed to raise money locally to be used with the grant to build permanent classrooms. The Department and the then Minister, Batt O'Keeffe, were convinced to go with this scheme. It was a pilot scheme, being the first such scheme in the country. The school went ahead and provided extra classrooms with the money allocated by the Department for prefabricated classrooms. This has been huge value for money. I visited the school recently and it has enormous problems. It got the best value for money possible from the last tranche of funding it received from the Department. The board of management involved a very good local engineer and much good work was done with the builders. Now it has a short-term problem and difficulties will arise in September 2013. It has been allocated an extra mainstream classroom teacher but there is no room for that teacher. The projected enrolments mean a huge problem will occur in 2016. What does the Department of Education and Skills envisage for the school? This issue requires urgent attention. I understand inspectors from the Department visited the school recently to discuss the problem. Short-term and long-term problems exist with regard to accommodation. We need to take a holistic approach. The Department will throw money at a short-term problem to try to sort it out but the long-term issue needs to be considered. The Department needs to examine the school's space and ground. The board of management is very innovative and this has been proved in the past. In agreement with the Department it can stretch a euro as far as possible. The short-term and long-term problems need to be examined because this rural school will experience a huge growth rate in the coming years.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14560	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	180	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I thank the Deputy for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the position on the application for additional accommodation received from Millstreet Convent national school, County Cork. It is a co-educational primary school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to second class and for girls only from third to sixth class. I am aware the school had 218 enrolled pupils in September 2011 and that the current enrolment is 244 pupils, as the Deputy outlined. I understand the school expects enrolments to increase further next September 2013. On 5 October the Department of Education and Skills received an application from the school for the provision of one additional mainstream classroom and two learning support rooms to meet its current needs. In addition, the Department received a further application from the school on 15 October for major capital funding to provide additional mainstream classrooms to cater for the school's projected longer term enrolments. In this regard, the Department of Education and Skills will examine the demographics of the area concerned. The analysis will take into account results from census 2011, child benefit data for the area and an examination of current school enrolments with a view to establishing future accommodation requirements for the area. The school's applications will be assessed in the context of the Department's analysis of need in the area and a decision on the applications will be conveyed to the school authority subsequently. The Deputy will be aware that the five year programme which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced on 12 March 2012 will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which 80,000 will be new school places. The remainder will be the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation. Where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher, and where a school's existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, the Department considers applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms, mainly on a devolved basis. The delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	181	I thank the Minister of State for his reply and for outlining the facts. The board of management has been in discussion with the local community to get a room for the extra classroom. The Department will provide money for a prefab, but the school does not want this because it is a short-term solution and it believes it would be a waste of vital resources. The Minister of State outlined extra school places would be provided in developing areas. This school is classified as a developing school. It is probably one of the few developing schools outside of the greater urban centres. An immediate problem has arisen and an application was received by the Department on 5 October. I am asking for every urgency to be given to this so the board of management is not left in limbo until all of the issues have been gone through. Surely they can be correlated and examined as a matter of urgency. A holistic approach must be taken, not only on the short-term issue but also on the school's status as a developing school because of the projected growth in numbers in the coming years. Will the Minister of State ensure there is no delay in the Department, that the application is processed as quickly as possible and that the school does not just get an answer to the short-term issue but also obtains a solution for the long-term issue coming down the tracks?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14560	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	182	I note the Deputy's concerns in this regard and the points he has made on the school's developing school status. I reiterate that the Department will be in contact with the school when the demographic analysis in the area has been completed.If, through the good offices of the Deputy, the board of management was to contact me directly, I would be happy to engage with the school, subject to all of the criteria, particularly the budgetary criteria, laid down in that regard. Perhaps we can take a look at this with a view to solving the problem without giving any false hope at this stage. I would be happy to visit the school if such an invitation was extended to me. I am not making any promises but there may be ways around this. It is important that the Department has the opportunity to complete the vital demographic study.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	Last Saturday evening in the town of Kincasslagh in County Donegal, which is probably best known throughout the country for being the home town of Daniel O'Donnell, over 200 local residents turned up for a public meeting. It was a meeting to voice their concerns about the ongoing and escalating anti-social behaviour and criminal activity occurring in the area. This activity culminated in a recent unprovoked petrol bomb attack on a car outside the home of an elderly lady and her daughter. Unfortunately, due to family commitments, I was unable to attend the meeting. However, I have spoken to many people from that area and I can tell the Minister that there is a real sense of fear, shock and concern in the area, particularly on the part of the elderly community. These are people who are genuinely frightened by the increase in crime and the lack of Garda presence in rural areas. Nobody expects a garda to stand on every street corner to catch the culprits intent on pursuing a path of crime. Nevertheless, there is a growing fear that the Garda at current resource levels is not in a position to provide effective policing for rural areas. On the night of the petrol bombing, I am informed that it was two hours after the initial call that the Garda patrol car arrived on the scene of the attack. Meanwhile, we know that crime is on the increase. According to the latest CSO crime statistics, there was an 18.3% increase in burglaries in the northern region, which includes Donegal, in the year up to June 2012. Hardly a week goes by without my hearing about another attack on a home, business or community across County Donegal, either directly through my constituency office or through the media. In particular, older people feel increasingly vulnerable in their homes and I am sure this is not unique to Donegal. These people must be reassured that the gardaí are present in the community and that they can help protect them.  Instead of providing the necessary resources to tackle the issues effectively, this and the previous Government have in successive budgets depleted the resources of the Garda. They have stripped the resources bare to a point where the Garda cannot fulfil the demands of the community. This year, the Minister oversaw the closure of 39 Garda stations, three of which were in my county - Culdaff, Doochary and Dunkineely. They were all closed on the Minister's watch. There are reports that another 96 stations may be considered for closure. The Minister has already informed us that the draft policing plan for 2013 is likely to contain further proposals for rationalisation of Garda stations and districts. An example is the threatened removal of the Glenties district headquarters, which could see the redeployment of up to 30 to 40 full-time gardaí from west Donegal, further highlighting the concerns of the people in this area.  If the Minister was to put it into context, we know that crime is on the increase in these areas. One does not need reports; one only needs to live in the area to know it is happening, yet from 2008 to this year, Donegal saw a reduction of 52 Garda personnel. I know it was not done solely on the Minister's watch as Fianna Fáil oversaw most of it. The county has seen a reduction in Garda numbers from 488 in 2008 to 436 today. Unfortunately, that trajectory is continuing and we are at breaking point. It is not good enough that it takes two hours for Garda personnel in a patrol car to arrive in a rural area where a car has been petrol bombed by criminals in that area, putting the lives of the individuals inside the adjoining house in jeopardy. What assessment does the Minister and the Garda Commissioner make of rural areas and their policing needs when making decisions to close down stations and reduce Garda numbers in these areas? 
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	184	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I heard what he had to say about the petrol bomb incident. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot refer to the detail of a matter that is under investigation by An Garda Síochána in the House. The Deputy will be aware that the allocation of resources by the Commissioner is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level. On a daily basis, gardaí are involved in preventing and detecting crime and criminal activity. The House will be aware that as recently as this morning a man died from gunshot wounds in Golden in County Tipperary. While it is too early to speculate on the circumstances or motive behind this incident, it is yet another stark reminder of the issues being dealt with by members of the Garda Síochána. Both the Government and the Garda are responding to the challenges in policing and in dealing with a very difficult economic situation. I will detail some of those responses. The House will be aware that despite budgetary constraints, I announced a substantial additional investment of €3 million this week in Garda transport for the purchase of new vehicles. It is anticipated that 170 vehicles will be delivered to the Commissioner and come on stream in December and January. They will be in addition to the over 200 vehicles which have been brought in to service since the beginning of 2011. In addition to our 13,500 gardaí, which is a great deal more than we had even at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, we now have over 1,000 Garda reserves who assist the gardaí in their day to day work. Garda reserves are vital links to our communities and I commend them for their service. There are also over 2,000 civilian staff who provide vital technical, administrative and specialist support to front line gardaí. These include scenes of crime specialists such as photographers, analysts, IT specialists, etc. Compared with England and Wales or other smaller countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Finland, we have more police officers per head of population. In particular, the implementation of the new Garda roster system ensures that resources are optimally deployed when and where they are required to every part of the community, both rural and urban. The same drive for efficiency is also what determined the Commissioner's decisions to close some Garda stations in 2012, as mentioned by the Deputy. I expect a further rationalisation of the Garda station and district network in the forthcoming policing plan. The objective at all times is to ensure that the most effective and efficient service is delivered across the country. While I fully understand the concern that communities may have about possible Garda station closures, I am convinced that in providing a modern, effective police force, our emphasis should not be on bricks and mortar. Up until the station closures which took place earlier this year, this State had a Garda station network that was mostly unchanged since 1922 and which took no account of modern transportation, communication and policing methods. We must focus on making the best possible use of our police resources so that gardaí are out on our streets and in our communities responding to crime and providing visible policing rather than waiting for occasional callers to a Garda station. I am, of course, very conscious of the deep distress which burglaries and thefts can cause to the unfortunate victims of such crimes. The most recent comparative figures published by the CSO indicate that the incidence of burglary and theft in Donegal has, in fact, been less than in many other areas of the country. However, that is not to minimise the impact of such crimes on those affected by them, particularly the elderly and more vulnerable members of society, or the impact of a petrol bomb attack on any individual or family.  I welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner has announced the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries. In May of this year, the Garda Commissioner launched the national "Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign". This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, in particular, burglary prevention by engaging with communities. Operation Fiacla, which commenced in February last, is focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country so as to disrupt their activities and bring them before the courts. Operation Fiacla is intelligence-driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region in support of this operation to target suspect offenders, disrupt their activities and secure their attendance before the courts. I am confident that Operation Fiacla is making an impact. Since its commencement in February up to 22 August last, over 1,700 persons have been arrested and almost 1,000 persons have been charged as part of the operation.This clearly reflects the substantial efforts being made by the Garda to tackle the prolific offenders who are behind the growth in burglaries. The Garda national model of community policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. In this regard, the Garda continues to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including through partnership programmes such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch, in addition to more formal structures such as joint policing committees. I pay tribute to everyone in the Garda Síocháná for the commitment and professionalism they display in carrying out their duties. I assure all communities, including the one in Donegal referred to by the Deputy, that the Garda is efficiently carrying out its functions and that it will do everything possible to bring criminality to an end. However, the reality is that no matter how many members of the force there are, there will always be individuals within communities intent on criminality and targeting individuals for a variety of reasons. We cannot have a member of An Garda standing outside every house in every rural or urban community. In the context of making reference to rural Garda stations, I draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that the main station closures occurred not in rural areas, but in Dublin. Whitehall and Harcourt Terrace Garda stations were both closed in the context of the consolidation and rationalisation of stations with a view to using resources as efficiently as possible. The next largest station to close was Dalkey Garda station, which is in the Tánaiste's constituency. It is a question of smart policing, using resources efficiently and ensuring the members of the force are not sitting unnecessarily at desks in Garda stations rather than being engaged in front line duties.

His last comments show that he fails to understand rural areas. It is not about the size of the station but about the presence and service it provides. Culdaff, Dunkineely and Doochary are wee villages and do not need a massive Garda station, but they need the service. The service was taken away from them by the Government. The Minister said it is a question of smart policing. If people could see that the closures of the stations in question led to the presence of more gardaí on the street or a better service, they might be able to accept them. They do not see more, however. Therefore, let us look at the facts. I have a very simple question for the Minister. I understand that this matter is not entirely under the Minister's watch but he should note that 52 gardaí were taken away from Donegal over the past four years, and three stations have been closed down. Some 200 people turned up at a public meeting in this regard on Saturday evening. The Minister knows as well as I do that it is very difficult to get people to attend public meetings on different issues, yet 200 people in a small rural community decided this issue was important enough to warrant their turning up. The people affected are respected, upstanding members of the community whose car, which was parked outside their house, was petrol-bombed. They did not provoke anybody and the community has rallied around them. The community is asking a simple question, perhaps through me. What does the Minister have to say to the community in Kincasslagh to reassure it that it will be in a better position tomorrow than it was yesterday or the day before? What decisions can the Minister make to ensure the Garda is resourced as much as possible so it can respond to the needs of that community? I said in my opening statement that we do not expect a garda at every street corner. I appreciate the work of the Garda, be it in rural or urban areas, but I understand from it and others that it is under-resourced and working against tremendous odds because it is not getting the support of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.

It has my full support and that of the Government. However, we must live in a world of reality, from which the Deputy is semi-detached. This year, the State requires to borrow €16 billion simply to maintain services. We entered into government under the shadow of an EU-IMF-ECB agreement that requires us to reduce public expenditure. We entered government under the shadow of an agreement that required us to reduce the number of members in the Garda force, in addition to a broad range of other reductions. When we came into government, we had the largest number of members in the force in the history of the State. It was even greater than the number in the force during the Troubles. The number has been reduced from approximately 14,500 to 13,500 by retirements. The force is still substantially greater in number than it was during the course of the Troubles. There are substantially more policemen and policewomen in Ireland per head than in most other European countries. Therefore, it is not a question of bricks and mortar; it is about smart policing and doing what is necessary without delimiting the manner in which the Garda operates and its effectiveness. The Deputy is peddling an untruth. Despite the closure of 39 Garda stations, there has been, according to the statistics up to the end of June 2012, a reduction in crime across every category in the State in the past 12 months, except in the area of burglary and in the area of theft, in respect of which there was a very small increase. In the area of burglary, Operation Fiacla is having a profound impact. Many of those who are responsible for the increase in burglaries over the past 18 months will find themselves, in the coming weeks and months, before the courts as a result of charges brought as a consequence of that operation. I assure all rural communities that the Garda has the Government's full support. It will be resourced as best we can properly resource it in the difficult financial circumstances that exist in the State. I urge all rural communities to participate in Community Alert schemes and I ask citizens to provide their own security in their homes by way of burglar alarms and to be careful to ensure they do not do anything that sets them out as possible victims of some of the lawless individuals who are still intent on crime. Let the Deputy not peddle the myth that the Garda has anything but my absolute support and that of the Government in the work it is doing.

I join the Minister in complimenting the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Judge Michael Reilly, on his work on the report. It is fair to say he went about that work in a dedicated and fearless manner, turning up unannounced continually to get to the bottom of many of the matters referred to in the report. It is noteworthy that he spoke not only to prisoners and prison officers, but also to service providers and management. He informed himself quite widely on the issues outlined. We all agree the report is fairly damning. It outlines some very serious issues and their consequences. It is noteworthy that what is contained in the report is at complete variance with the mission statement of the Irish Prison Service, which was to provide safe, secure and humane custody for people who are sent to prison. The mission statement of the Irish Prison Service has now been amended to include the dignity of care for the people entrusted to the service. For the sake of completeness, let me quote some brief extracts from the report. The inspector states:[T]he detention of children in St. Patricks should end as a matter of urgency. It is my view that the timeline for ending the detention of children (May 2014) should be revisited.In essence, the report states children's human rights were violated and that children were maltreated, degraded and abused.We all agree this is not a political issue. It concerns the management of the Prison Service as well as the staff members who perpetrated these acts.

When I was elected to the House, I realised that positive announcements would be few and far between during our time in government. However, when the Minister announced last April that the practice of incarcerating children in St. Patrick's Institution was to end, I was proud of what we were achieving and I believed we were moving towards a new republic. I visited the unit and met its residents and staff, but the report's findings are disgusting. Although Judge Michael Reilly is to be commended, why were the concerns of the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, regarding St. Patrick's Institution not heeded? Judge Reilly's report states:I met a child on B Wing who was on 23 hour lock up. This child was quite fragile. He explained to me that he was now talking to himself.It also states: "This was the first time that any prisoner, in any prison, had displayed such fear in my presence." Another part of the report states: "The bed clothes were dirty, the toilet was blocked and he had no running water." By what date exactly will the practice of incarcerating children in St. Patrick's Institution come to an end? How will those who oversaw the maltreatment of children there be held to account for their actions?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	I will commence by thanking Deputies Niall Collins and Ó Ríordáin for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to speak on the issues arising from the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention's report on St. Patrick's Institution, which I published yesterday. I would like to begin by thanking the inspector, Judge Michael Reilly, for his report. He has a tremendous record of providing independent oversight of our prison system and brings a forensic eye, persistence and dedication to the process, for which the Government and I are very grateful. With regard to St. Patrick's Institution, as he remarks in his report, he made a number of unannounced visits on a variety of occasions to facilitate his getting the best insight possible into the running of the institution. His reports, however critical they may be, make a real difference and I can assure the House no stone will be left unturned in addressing the issues raised in this particular report. I also want to say that I greatly valued the report prepared by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Logan, last year following her discussions with young people detained in St. Patrick's Institution. Her work is much appreciated and she can be assured of my full support, as evidenced by the decision to extend her remit to St. Patrick's Institution. As I said yesterday, neither I nor the Government will tolerate the type of abuse outlined by the inspector in his report. It is unacceptable in any civilised society. This must change and it will change. Let there be no doubt about that. The report raises serious issues and major concerns, including weak management, the behaviour of some prison staff, the culture in the prison, the inattention to human rights norms, prisoners on protection and the prevalence of drugs. The inspector concluded that there was a culture in St. Patrick's Institution that resulted in the human rights of some prisoners - children and young adults - being either ignored or violated. However, from the outset I would assure the Deputies that concrete measures have been taken to address the recommendations made by the inspector, with over 80% of the recommendations being implemented to date. This report is shocking, and I am grateful to the inspector for bringing these matters to light. For many years I personally had concerns about St. Patrick's Institution and believed it was an inappropriate facility for children. I was instrumental in ensuring the Government was committed to change in the programme for Government, which included a specific commitment in that regard: "We will end the practice of sending children to St. Patrick's Institution." Simply put, the Government will not tolerate this type of abuse. It is completely unacceptable. I visited St. Patrick's Institution on 22 March 2011, within two weeks of my appointment. Indeed, it was a private visit with no media in attendance. Unfortunately, on a ministerial visit the difficulties observed and detailed by Judge Reilly were not readily apparent. The value of his unannounced visits and inspections cannot be overestimated. I met the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention in early May last, as he had asked to discuss the situation in St. Patrick's Institution with me, and there has been regular contact with him since then. It is also important not to lose sight of the fact that the inspector acknowledges in his report that the majority of staff in St. Patrick's Institution carry out their duties in a professional manner and the problem lies with a very small minority of staff. Having had this engagement with the inspector, both the director general of the Irish Prison Service and I were in a position to ensure action was taken immediately. An action plan addressing all the inspector's recommendations was put into place without delay. This included the appointment of a new senior management team, which has been tasked with providing clear and decisive leadership to the staff in order that the problems outlined by the inspector are dealt with quickly and effectively. This team, led by the new governor, is liaising closely with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention to ensure each and every one of the inspector's recommendations is implemented. Indeed, in this context, the Irish Prison Service has also undertaken to ensure enhanced prison health care procedures are put in place and records are maintained on the removal and relocation of prisoners. A new dedicated committal unit is in operation and a new vulnerable persons unit is being established. Additional security arrangements have been introduced to minimise drugs and contraband entering the prison. Educational facilities will be improved along with the provision of an incentivised regimes programme and an improvement in physical conditions and facilities generally. The type of control and restraint mechanism of some prison officers as detailed by the inspector in his report has been brought to an end. One of the Government's priorities in the programme for Government was to remove 16 and 17 year old offenders completely from the adult prison system. In this context, the practice of sending 16 year old boys to St. Patrick's Institution ceased on 1 May 2012. From that date, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds have been detained in the children detention facilities in Oberstown. There are no 16 year old prisoners today in St. Patrick's Institution. The Government has also sanctioned the provision of the necessary funding for a new detention facility at Oberstown. This is due for completion in mid-2014. These matters were all dealt with by me in co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Ms Frances Fitzgerald. In the interim, the Minister has agreed to examine the feasibility of accommodating some categories of 17 year old boys in Oberstown on a phased basis earlier than mid-2014, if possible. Arrangements are being made for a number of care staff from the children detention schools to work on placement in St. Patrick's Institution alongside prison staff. It is intended that this will take place within the next two months. In addition, the remit of the Ombudsman for Children was extended on 1 July 2012 to include St. Patrick's Institution, something she has sought for a number of years and a request with which previous Governments failed to agree or implement. Very soon after I took office as the Minister for Justice and Equality, I initiated a consultation process with the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention regarding the introduction of a new complaints procedure for the prison system. This process has been completed recently with the appointment of a panel of 22 external investigators, and the new complaints system will go live on 1 November next. I have instructed the director general of the Prison Service to direct the new investigators to commence an examination of previous complaints in St. Patrick's Institution, such as those referred to by the inspector in his report. I am conscious and only too well aware that a series of reports going back many years were produced on St. Patrick's Institution, in particular on the need to remove 16 and 17 year olds from there. These reports were not acted upon by previous Ministers for Justice or Governments. I will not be going the same route. This report will not be and has not been ignored. The Irish Prison Service and I, in consultation with the inspector, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Irish Youth Justice Service, have acted with great speed to address the issues raised in this report. It is my objective to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the situation of accommodating 17 year olds in St. Patrick's Institution.

What is the exact timeline for closing St. Patrick's Institution? His reply did not include that information. I asked about the investigation under the stewardship of the director general, which the Minister also referred to in his reply.Will there be outside input into that investigation from An Garda Síochána? Judge Michael Reilly indicated in his report that the visiting committees appeared to be carrying out their function under the 1925 Act, which is a little vague. Is there a deficiency in the role or remit of the visiting committee? Why did it not pick up what the Inspector of Prisons did through his dedicated work? There is a value for money report from 2009 in the Minister's Department dealing with community service and probation. The argument is that the capacity could be increased threefold, so rather than having a policy of detaining those aged 16 and 17, we should consider seriously the rehabilitation of these people through more community service. The extra capacity has been outlined in that report.

I agree that this issue is down to a minority of staff but how can we expect any child to be rehabilitated when the behaviour outlined in this report is ongoing? The individuals who were victims of this malpractice will have no faith in the justice system at any time in future until the people responsible for these actions are seen to be held accountable. Will the Minister expand on the issue? Will the Minister provide an assurance on direct provision centres, which are also causing much concern for those with child welfare on their minds? Will they be subject to the same type of investigation as is evident in this case?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	198	As far as I am concerned, this sort of behaviour is not and will not in future be ongoing. A new managerial team has been put in place in St. Patrick's Institution, and there is an important remit to ensure there is no repetition of any nature of any of the events depicted in this report. I have the assurance of the oversight of the inspector, Judge Reilly, who has done a fantastic job. He has indicated that he will make further reports to me when required and will continue to visit St. Patrick's Institution. It is my hope that the new management team will be effective in ensuring we do not see these types of events again. Some 60% of staff have been retrained and specific training has been provided for those at a management level. The remaining 40% will complete retraining in November. The old culture represented the borstals in Ireland but because of the immediate action we have taken and will take, it will be ended for all time. That is of the greatest importance. I am conscious that I have not responded to some of the questions raised by Deputy Niall Collins because of time limits. From the entire population of 200 in St. Patrick's Institution, there are 25 youths aged 17. With the construction of the new facility in Oberstown, it is envisaged that we will end the practice of having 17 year olds in St. Patrick's Institution. In or around the time this occurs, the intention is to effectively end using this facility for 18 year olds and 21 year olds. There will be better available facilities on completion of the extension to the Midlands Prison, with particularly good educational facilities there. There will also be good educational facilities in Wheatfield Prison. Ultimately, they will be the primary locations for that age group in the prison system, which is currently within St. Patrick's Institution. We are considering alternative uses for the institution. I agree entirely with Deputy Niall Collins with regard to community service. I have been encouraging the use of community service as an alternative where it is appropriate. We must be realistic with some of the people in St. Patrick's Institution. Tragically, some of the young people are very violent, and one of the great difficulties in the prison is that some of those sentenced and serving time in the prison are members of gangs. Prison officers, who have been working well, have a very difficult job in ensuring there is no violence within the prison, and some prisoners must have protection because they are under threat from other prisoners. It is not an easy environment and we should not pretend that it is. There are difficulties in dealing with some young people and, as Judge Reilly notes, some are damaged young people. The fact that they are damaged does not mean the violence of which they are capable is not recognised. Some of them are in prison as a consequence of very violent crimes. With regard to accountability for those who have misbehaved, I must be careful as Minister to say nothing that may prejudice any steps being taken. I have already referred to the fact that the new people appointed to provide an independent team addressing complaints or alleged misconduct, who will be in place from 1 November, will have a remit to examine complaints made to ensure they are properly investigated. I am advised that some officers within the institution are under investigation and I hope Deputies will forgive me if I say no more than that. I must not prejudice any possible outcomes, either in the disciplinary context within the Prison Service or in any other context. I am not aware of any current Garda investigation into any of these matters. I do not wish to mislead Deputies in that context. If a complaint was made to An Garda Síochána, I am sure it will be investigated. Currently, it is a matter for a prison disciplinary process and the particular focus is to ensure a changed culture, a different environment and to see that people's human rights and dignity are properly respected. There is a final matter.

A stop was put to that practice on 1 May last, as soon as we learned that was a difficulty. No matter what disciplinary issues are evident, when children are in prison, it is important - no matter the background - that some contact is maintained with family members. That practice is no longer a part of the disciplinary process.

Change is always a difficult but necessary process, and the change represented by this Bill is both difficult and necessary. In the end it will result in a much more streamlined training system, with significant savings to the Exchequer. For over 80 years, vocational education committees, VECs, have been a vital cog in the wheel of education in Ireland, providing a range of vocational education options from secondary schools throughout the country, including the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme and many night classes. The vocational schools or community colleges currently educate almost a quarter of all mainstream post-primary pupils and given the increasing importance to the community school sector, where they are co-patrons with religious authorities, the VECs are very significant. One may also consider the important role of post-leaving certificate courses and Youthreach programmes throughout the country, making it apparent that this sector is a significant player in Irish education. When the VECs were established in 1930, there were 38 bodies, and this was reduced to 33 in the 1990s. This Bill will see the creation of 16 education and training boards to replace those VECs. The Bill also represents a major step in legislation underpinning the new boards, as the current Bill will replace nine existing Vocational Education Acts. A number of benefits will arise from the streamlining of the education and training boards, not least the reform of human resources and the savings arising from that. The current Bill will also end the statutory inquiry system used in removing a VEC member of staff from office. The annual planning process will also be greatly enhanced. Currently, each of the 33 VECs produces education plans and the newly created education training boards will publish annual strategy statements. The new boards will also result in savings to members, given the reduced numbers of members nationally. These boards will comprise 18 members, with ten being local authority representatives, along with representatives of staff, parents and community business interests. I note that although the Bill provides for gender equality in the case of parent and community representatives, it does not do so with regard to local authority or staff members.The increased focus on community and business interests is welcome and, hopefully, will result in increased tailoring of vocational courses to meet the needs of the business community. Given the investment the new boards will make in education, it is imperative that benefits accrue to local business, in particular to business in the small and medium-sized sector. The new education and training boards will have a much expanded role in implementing Government policy on further education. The new boards will also absorb a large number of FÁS staff. I also note that in the coming months, this Government will bring forward legislation to provide for the establishment of a new training authority, SOLAS, which will see the dissolution of FÁS and the transfer of training schemes to the newly established boards. Another welcome development is the streamlining of the various awarding bodies. The new qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland will replace a range of bodies, including FETAC, HETAC, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland and the Irish Universities Quality Board. Once again, this change should result in significant savings in regard to human resources, physical resources and other costs. The Bill provides for the establishment of scholarships and also the provision of education at the request of any body which funds training out of the money provided by the Oireachtas. Effective monitoring of the new boards will be key to their success. I am glad to note that the Minister will have the power to direct a board, which is not working effectively, to take certain actions and may also require another board to carry out the functions of the board under investigation. In the event that a board fails to comply, the Minister has the power to transfer the board's functions to the CEO or another person for up to two years and the Minister can also order removal of all members of a board from office. Where a board is dissolved, its functions can be transferred to another person on the passing of an order by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The subject of VEC rationalisation was discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts in January and on that occasion, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that the VECs had a combined expenditure of €1.1 billion in 2009 and that headquarter functions cost €40 million, mainly comprising pay. The Minister has estimated that the merging of 33 VECs into 16 will save approximately €3.2 million annually and additional savings could be made via the disposal of property. Some 13 of 33 existing VECs own their own premises and the remaining 20 are leased. The decision whether to sell existing premises will rest with the CEOs of the new training boards. The new education and training boards provided for in this Bill will provide proper structures for the delivery of targeted educational programmes to a wide range of students and will also provide much needed savings to the State from the timely and sensible provisions in this Bill.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	204	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation creating the education and training boards. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock. This Bill is another piece of a package of measures the Government has brought forward in terms of the reform of how education is provided at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. As the previous speaker said, there has been little or no change in the structural roll-out of education through the vocational education committees since the 1930s. This Bill gives us an opportunity to re-examine what we expect from the education and training boards, previously known as the VECs. In my area, County Limerick VEC will be amalgamated with the City of Limerick VEC and County Clare VEC. They will be amalgamated under the auspices of the County Limerick VEC and the headquarters will be in Dooradoyle. It is a reflection of the regional need in Clare and in Limerick for a structure which will meet the needs of parents, teachers, managers and, more importantly, students, whether second level students or students continuing their education through night classes, back to education courses or PLC courses. We are talking about this Bill the day after the reform of local government package was announced and it is important there is continuity. While we are seeing a change in the structure, we are maintaining some continuity as well. Local authority representation on the education and training boards is important and I welcome the fact there will be ten seats per education and training board for local authority members. In the case of Limerick city, County Limerick and County Clare, it will be distributed by determination of the Minister, which is good. This is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the Chamber on education matters since the announcement of the reform of the junior certificate last week, which will be very relevant to those involved in the education and training boards. In what the Minister for Education and Skills announced last week, there is a move away from rote learning at junior certificate level, which I welcome. However, the move away from rote learn at junior certificate level cannot be done in isolation and it must be continued to the leaving certificate level. As a teacher, one of the things we were always told when being taught how to teach was that the worst possible way to teach is by rote learning and yet the biggest examination in a young person's life, which will determine their future career and where they will go, is based entirely on rote learning. There is something wrong with that. On the one hand, the Department of Education and Skills has acknowledged that rote learning at junior certificate level has failed and is not meeting the needs of the children it is supposed to serve while on the other, it is continuing on the basis that the leaving certificate is fit for purpose. There is a major anomaly there. The leaving certificate is not fit for purpose and the education and training boards, the Department of Education and Skills and Members of the House have a role in restructuring and reforming the leaving certificate and the senior cycle and asking parents, managers, teachers, students, employers and further education providers what we require from the senior cycle. This Bill makes provision for outside representation on the education and training boards. The Minister of State will probably agree that we must focus on how what we are doing currently will benefit the economy. It is, therefore, very important that we have representatives of the trade union movement and employers on education and training boards who can reflect what the marketplace, the workplace, employers and others require in terms of educational needs. Third level institutions, in particular, are running courses which provide few, if any, job opportunities in Ireland and that is a challenge for the Department. We must be fair to, and honest with, the people embarking on those course. One of the universities which has been to the fore in meeting the needs of the local employment base and the students is the University of Limerick. I am not saying that because I am from Limerick but it is by far and away out on its own in terms of revolutionising the delivery of education to students which then benefits the local economy and employers. We need to get people involved at a much earlier stage and one of the ways we can do that is through the education and training boards. The move to SOLAS - it is part of this because there will be a role for it - is a good thing. The rebranding of FÁS is a good thing because, unfortunately, FÁS became a very dirty word in the past few years. A small number of people used that organisation very meanly for their own particular purposes and benefited themselves. The move to SOLAS is a good thing but there is no point rebranding organisations like FÁS unless it is joined up to an overall strategy which, ultimately, will deliver an opportunity for the people who are going to avail of these courses, whether at second level or post-leaving certificate level, for gainful employment in their local communities. Ultimately, that is what this Bill must be about. I support the Bill and in doing so, I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours. Over the next 12 months, he will be busy as president of the Council of innovation ministers. He has a huge responsibility in delivering part of the cake to Ireland and the other countries in the economic mess we are in. I have no doubt the Minister of State is more than capable of doing so.

I think there was a general welcome across the political spectrum for the legislation and the effort behind it. It ticks a number of boxes in regard to saving money but it is also about reform and change. As a result, some people will be worried about elements of change. I should declare an interest in that I am on the board of management of Greenhills College in my constituency, which is a VEC school. It is a privilege to be on the board and I pay tribute to the hard work being carried out by the board members. They reflect the work of many VECs and school boards throughout the State. People give up a great deal of time to look out for schools and the positive role the schools have played in the past must be acknowledged. The reforming measures in the Bill are unprecedented in scale and in what they set out to achieve. A new local ETB system will be provided by replacing the nine existing VEC Acts with one principal Act, which is positive. A total of 16 new training boards will replace the 33 existing VECs. An bord snip nua had originally stated that the number of VECs should be reduced from 33 to 22. That number has now been reduced to 16 and I recall the discussions with the Minister about arriving at this number. There was a great deal of concern about counties being left out of that process and about where the headquarters would be located. One of the positive aspects of VECs has been their flexibility and ability to change over the years. The original legislation was passed in the 1930s and, therefore, for eight decades, the VECs have been paramount in the State's delivery of education and training and this modernisation and overhaul offers opportunities and challenges that are part of a wider multifaceted legislative overhaul of the further education and training sector. The VEC sector has been an important contributor historically to Government labour market interventions, originally in regard to high levels of youth employment in the 1980s and, more recently, in the provision of additional places under the PLC and the back to education initiative programmes as part of labour market activation strategies. The sector has had a culture of change at its heart. Concerns were expressed about the legislation in the context of the ability of the VECs to change in the light of difficulties being faced while maintaining their ethos and the radical element the VECs have shown over the years being lost in the proposed changes. The 16 ETBs will have a greatly extended role. They will absorb a significant percentage of FÁS staff and will be tasked with delivering a broad range of training programmes on behalf of SOLAS when it replaces FÁS. It is important that the new ETBs have board members from all sectors of society, including parents. This again was one of the concerns expressed. The VECs are very much seen as part of the community and people were concerned the board membership should include parents and others from the local community in order that people would buy in. People working in the sector are worried about their rights, conditions and transfer of obligations and that came up when we discussed the heads of the Bill at the joint committee hearing earlier this year and I have no doubt it will be raised again on Committee Stage. Staff are worried about whether the changes will undermine their conditions and leave them with less favourable conditions. The Minister pointed out at the time that this would not be the case but it is understandable that those who represent this sector would be worried and would articulate those concerns in the discussion on the legislation. The capacity of ETBs to shape the Ireland of the future will be significant. The ETBs will have a key role in identifying, prioritising and improving the educational and training standards that are so important for our future economic prosperity. Flexibility and responsiveness to changing and emerging needs has been a general feature of the operation of VECs. A key strategic consideration informing the restructuring of VECs is the need not only to retain and support this demonstrated capacity for flexibility and adaptability, but also to position the VEC sector to meet future challenges across the education and training sector generally. Many of the courses must not only be suitable for the labour market; they must also promote the ability and skills of the participants. This should not be only about a market driven response; it should also be about developing people. It is a key component of the ethos of those working in the community education sector that they develop the concept of lifelong learning. During previous education debates, one of the key issues I focused on was lifelong learning and the importance of helping women with literacy problems who were not engaged in the education system. In many communities, the husbands or partners of these women are not on the scene. They are single parents and it is important that they have literacy skills and an interest in education. This will encourage them to bring books, newspapers and magazines into their houses, which in turn, will encourage their children. We all want schools and centres of knowledge to be open to the public and the vocational education sector has spearheaded that over the years. However, it is important that when courses are rolled out in the community, the flexibility of the past is built on and they are adapted to people's lifestyles and offered, for example, when the children are in school and so on. Schools need to be seen as a safe, inclusive and secure space. In communities ravaged by drugs or crime, people say the local school can be a secure space where they and their children can go and talk and feel safe. Clearly, there were training difficulties in the past and that is where flexibility comes in but there is huge potential if we can get this right. Hopefully, this will happen, as we are not at cross purposes in this regard. Education at every level from kindergarten to university should be a right, not a privilege. We continue to experience major cutbacks in education and increasing costs in getting education. The Government needs to recognise the benefits education and training can add to the economy and to the lives of individuals. As unemployment continues to grow, it has become increasingly urgent that communities be provided with a centre that provides training and educational opportunities, which will allow people looking to learn new skills and subjects to find a job in a rapidly evolving jobs environment. Ensuring that all people, no matter what their economic and educational background is, have an opportunity to upskill is one of the most measurable ways in which our citizens can empower themselves and open up new opportunities for them. That is why we need to grasp this opportunity and the Bill offers the potential to implement far reaching reforming measures. We need a greater focus on education and training for people who suffer from literacy problems or adults who are returning to education. This would not only improve people's independence but would also ensure they became more employable.This helps to improve their finances and Government revenue. It is a no-brainer. I see a stronger focus on second chance education. I genuinely believe in the concept of lifelong learning, which is not just a slogan. We need supports to help people but there must also be community and individual buy-in. We must have courses and training to reflect the needs and aspirations of those people. It is a question of building on people's educational experience. There is nothing more demoralising for someone who wants to take a course than being told one is not suitable and cannot make progress in education. It is about that ladder and the steps forward. I hope the education and training boards will ensure schools can work together and capitalise on economies of scale to allow them to secure better deals for uniforms and textbooks. This issue arose at the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA. The general secretary talked about economies of scale, bulk buying and the importance of saving money for that sector. Reference was made to making savings on uniforms. I upset many manufacturers when I referred to the uniform racket but I make no apology for it. I stand by that position. A number of multiples have become involved in the market, leading to a drop in price. It is a scandal that a child, although he or she may be large, must fork out €80 or €90 for a school jumper because it has a crest. Manufacturers can produce school crests for €2 or €3 and they can be bought internationally. Many of the uniforms come from China and families can access the product on the Internet. The families know the price they are paying and they know they are being ripped off. Bulk buying can work and it can be used to reduce fees for ICT school supplies and so forth. Although it cannot be contained in legislation, there should be an instruction from the Department that we want to see such change and co-operation in the sector. There should be support for this. Any change to the Irish education and training system, through reform of public services, must strike a balance between securing efficiency and making delivery of services more effective in terms of learner outcomes and more rewarding from the point of view of those who deliver the service. Therefore, the reform of education and training provision must not focus exclusively on the expenditure side. Adequate provision must be allocated to the implementation of the training boards Bills so that meaningful reform of education and training provision can be achieved. It is a case of trying to find out the budget and how it will operate in the future. The Minister referred to potential savings through the reduction in the number of chief executive officers. There is concern about headquarters where VECs are tied into long-term contracts. Buildings should not be turned into white elephants. There is a need to use them for educational purposes in such cases. It is important the buildings are not used for only one or two days a week but are fully availed of for some community activity if not aid for education. They could be hubs of education and centres of learning in the areas. The Bill presents an opportunity that may not present itself again for many years to come. When considering the legislation, we must also work towards the delivery of high quality education that meets the needs of the most disadvantaged in society. Almost 500,000 people are unemployed and need to be upskilled. They are looking for opportunity and hope. The length of time people must wait when trying to access these courses is a key component of the matter, although it does not concern the legislation. Flexibility and the type of course offered represent a major responsibility for the Government to deliver. I have expressed my concern in respect of the gender of the board members. There should be parental and community involvement and buy-in is important. I wish the Minister well.

I will focus on reform, literacy and empowering the public service. What the Minister is trying to do in primary, secondary and further education at third level includes junior certificate reform, a literacy and numeracy strategy, a review of the enrolment policy expected in the new year, anti-bullying strategies and a forum on patronage and pluralism. A major amount is happening in the education sector. It is important to realise we cannot achieve any of these without empowering the public service. Major reform is being undertaken. I stress that it is disingenuous of Government backbenchers to talk about the Croke Park agreement and to issue disingenuous statements on the agreement that undermine the respect we have for public servants and that completely misunderstand the relationship Departments must have with teachers and those involved in the education sector. When we try to reform, we must bring people with us. When we try to reform the junior certificate, we must bring with us teachers, educators and school boards of management. When we reform elements of the further education sector, we must bring with us the people engaged in it. When trying to stress the importance of literacy and numeracy in primary schools, we must bring with us the people who will deliver such programmes. These people have taken a 14% pay cut and have been asked to work longer hours. They feel continuously under attack, under strain and undermined. I plead with so-called experts on the Croke Park agreement, who probably have not read it, to take time to pause and realise that none of this reform can take place without the goodwill of those involved in the sector. Many of our schools, further education bodies and universities run on goodwill. Undermining that goodwill undermines everything. It is almost impossible to achieve any reform without a sense of leadership and asking people to come with you. Issuing a poorly drafted, incoherent and disingenuous statement that completely misrepresents the Croke Park agreement and what it can achieve undermines the reforms these people are asking the Government to proceed with and deliver. Literacy is extremely important because we have convinced ourselves for so long that we are the land of saints and scholars. We have a literacy problem and it cannot be fixed by the education system. A three year old child from a welfare dependent family will have a vocabulary of 450 words, whereas a three year old child from a professional family has 1,200 words. The gulf exists before the children come near the education system.The education system can only do so much. We have prioritised literacy and numeracy at primary level and have empowered teachers to deliver that. We are doing the same at second level in conjunction with junior certificate reform, which also has a significant literacy component. I ask the Minister to act on the suggestion of the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and make a space on each of the education and training boards for an adult learner in order that they can complete the circle of the literacy process. We must empower all those involved in the education sector, including adult learners, students, teachers and administrators. We cannot reform from the top down. We must reform in conjunction and in partnership, and with a fundamental understanding of what happens in schools and in colleges of further education.

This has been a good couple of weeks. We have seen this Bill as well as the reform of the junior certificate and the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government of reform of local government, all of which have been talked about for decades but did not happen. I am glad to see that the reform agenda is being pushed through. It makes perfect sense to reduce the number of VECs from 33 to 16 - there were originally 38 committees - and to reduce the nine Education Acts to one. Having had to go through Education Acts as chairman of a VEC, I am aware this measure will simplify matters. I welcome the contribution of Deputy Seán Crowe. This is not just about saving money. It is about making the system fit for purpose, which it has not been for a long time. The boards will reflect the reality that education boards do not need to be organised on a county basis but can reflect population and regions. Now that the boards will be rationalised, it is important to refocus and look at areas where the VECs can carry out a greater role in education and retraining. It is notable that the word "training" is included in the title of the new boards. It is vital to recognise that alongside education we must train people with the right skills for the workforce, which has not necessarily happened in the education sector. For a long time, VECs were associated with apprenticeships, and the apprenticeship model is now outdated. It must be reformed and looked at again. In the European model that operates in Germany and the Netherlands, the idea of apprenticeship has been expanded. We should look at that, now that we have reformed the education boards. There is much work to be done. If we are to have an export-led recovery, a focus on skills is needed and a structure that gives people a path to jobs, whether in services, manufacturing, agriculture or industry. I am a former pupil of City of Dublin VEC. I was the first chair of City of Dublin VEC who was educated by a VEC. Nessa Childers MEP and I had the privilege of attending Ringsend Tech, which is now Ringsend College. The college was established to educate young people in fishing skills.

This give us an idea how VECs can change and reinvent themselves. From my experience of City of Dublin VEC, I can say VECs are reforming, innovative and enterprising. We have seen this with the roll-out of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, where VECs deal with the new grants structure. We need to allow the new education and training boards to develop. When I was chair of City of Dublin VEC, the principal of Crumlin College noticed there was a new type of unemployed person for whom the college's courses were not suitable. Some of these people had third level education. She went to the unemployment exchange, did a survey of recently unemployed people and considered the skills they needed to get back into the education market. From that, she designed a course covering ten modules. They were oversubscribed by people who had recently become unemployed. Many of them had degrees but were anxious to fill in the gaps they needed to get back to education. Innovation can be at that very basic level. The old VECs have very significant experience in building. Can we use that as a hub of knowledge in order that primary and other secondary schools can use this expertise in the building sectors? Former pupils of Ballyfermot College are winning Oscars on the international stage. Ten years ago, no one would have thought a VEC would expand into that area and create real jobs and gain an international presence. We must allow the new education and training boards to look at the wide expanse and see where they want to go. Ballsbridge College, which is close to the home ground of the Minister and myself, has partnered with the Chinese Embassy to look at ways of developing language skills for young unemployed people. That is the innovation we want. Reducing the number of VECs to 16 education and training boards will allow other colleges to develop in an innovative manner. The Minister must make space to allow the boards to grow into new sectors that we have not even thought about. He must say to the CEOs to come up with good ideas which he can support. Programmes such as Youthreach must not be left behind. Youthreach, particularly in urban areas, gives a second opportunity to young people who have been left behind. A Youthreach group from the Parnell Street area of Dublin came into the House this morning. Education did not work for these young people. In Youthreach they are doing European studies and they came to Leinster House to see how the democratic system works. They were excited again about education. For these young people, now in their 20s, school was a bore, but they were delighted to be getting a second chance. We need to ensure this sort of thing happens. In urban areas, VEC schools place great emphasis on ensuring no disadvantaged child is left behind. They work beyond the call of duty to keep such children in education. In my experience, where VECs have pulled out of mainstream second level education, such young people can fall out of education. Other second level schools do not have the necessary experience to deal with severely disadvantaged children, possibly with numeracy and literacy problems. The new boards need to stay in that space where they have the necessary experience. There is a wonderful opportunity for the 16 new education and training boards to develop and move into a new position and enhance the opportunities of our young people.

I was part of this area when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. Although I have since moved to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the work of this committee is intrinsically linked to the content of the Education and Training Boards Bill. I will speak on two aspects of the Bill, which are the reform agenda of the Department of Education and Skills and the importance of further education and training for the large number of people who are currently unemployed. The Bill is one more in a series of steps being taken by the Department of Education and Skills. The policies of the Department are being spring cleaned. Officials are looking at best practice and at what must be done to make ourselves fit for purpose for the future. The Minister said the Bill is about enhancing learning. I totally agree with that. I also commend the Minister on the other reforms that have taken place. Hopefully, some people outside the House, as well as some of the Deputies, are watching what is happening here today because this is real reform. We should stop what we are doing for ten seconds and try to understand what reform means and what reforms are happening through the legislative process in this new Bill. Radical changes are happening to our education system because of this. I will speak about a couple of them which are quite good. Unfortunately, I will not be present when the junior certificate is due to be discussed in the Dáil. As a secondary school teacher, I would love to speak on it. The change is warmly welcome and overdue, and I am delighted the Minister is doing something about it. SOLAS is also due to be established. This will work in tandem with the education and training boards. It is a little like a jigsaw puzzle. This Bill is just one part of a jigsaw that will overhaul how education is delivered in Ireland at all levels, which will ultimately affect the individual and their employability. It is 70 years since the Beveridge report was produced in the United Kingdom. Those familiar with the report will know that it was the origin of the National Health Service, NHS, which is similar to what we are trying to introduce here with the universal health insurance scheme. Seventy years ago, in 1942, the Second World War was ongoing, so in challenging times, when things are difficult, good decisions can be made. The Education and Training Boards Bill is being introduced during a challenging time but we will see its fruit in time. I am familiar with the heads of the Bill. The Minister did something quite new in that regard. The committee saw the heads of the Bill and was able to discuss them before the Bill was brought to the floor of the House. It was a great privilege to be part of composing more than the heads of the Bill. Obviously a number of people from the VECs and other sectors appeared before the committee to discuss their concerns about the direction the Bill should take. From my perspective, the most important part of the Bill deals with the provision of education and training. It needs to meet the challenges of the workplace today. I am very concerned about that. I realise SOLAS is the new body that will be established, but the ETBs will oversee the delivery of the training and education which we are relying on to upskill people and ensure their employability, so they are a step closer to the world of work. We have only one shot at getting the service right. It was the 1930s when we last did something in this sector with the Vocational Education Act. Now, 80 years later, we are introducing this Bill. It will probably be after our lifetimes before the next change is made, so it is really important that we get the composition of this right. I hope that will be the case with all the services. There is one issue I wish to highlight in respect of the education and training section. As Members know, I am a secondary school teacher. I believe one is always a teacher. One might leave the profession, but one is still involved in teaching. I value what education means. Education is not just about getting somebody a job. I understand the intrinsic value that education brings to somebody's life. As the Minister said, education is the great liberator. It allows people to move to a different place in their lives, which would not have been possible otherwise. I am an example of that. However, given the constraints of the current economic crisis, what must be centre stage in the delivery of further education and training is the employability factor that the course will offer the person who undertakes it. The ETBs will have a strong role in this. To ensure the employability factor is part of the further education and training sector, we need to get rid of courses such as ECDL, European Computer Driving Licence. There must be a proper audit of the courses. With regard to the composition of the boards, I regret there is no designated nomination for a business person on the board. That would be crucial. Although they can be nominated as one of the four representatives, it is a pity they are not a designated nomination. If we are to be truly successful in integrating education and training into the world of work, we must have the pulse of what is happening in industry, and the best people to tell us that is the people in industry. They would be able to guide us in a way that nobody in the Department of Education and Skills or possibly even in this House could do, with no disrespect to anybody. FIT, Fast Track to IT, is a good example of where this model is practised well and where industry has been invited to be the pulse for how it proceeds. FIT is funded through the Department of Education and Skills and has a 70% job progression rate for the people who do its courses. Its board is composed of the IBMs, Intels and so forth of this world so it is constantly addressing the needs of industry and developing courses, along with the VEC, to meet those needs. The result is that seven out of ten people who complete those courses gain full-time employment within two years. There is a lesson to be learned from that. People need to have faith. We all have anecdotal evidence of people not having faith in the systems in place to date. One of them is FÁS. I am aware of an unemployed electrician who went to FÁS recently and the only course he was offered was fork-lift driving. His employability factor was not going to change much as a result. We must invest in career paths. When all the jigsaw pieces of SOLAS, the one-stop-shop and the ETBs we are discussing today come together, they will provide a career path to people to ensure they will be closer to the world of work when they finish, if they do not secure a job straight away. I see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle gesturing to me to conclude. I welcome this legislation. It provides for real reform. I admire its aims. Although the Minister and I might disagree on things sometimes, I fully support all the reforms he has introduced to date and I look forward to future reforms from the Department of Education and Skills.

The aim of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide for the establishment of newly configurated bodies, the education and training boards, to replace the vocational education committees, VECs. I wish to remember the VECs in a special way. I have a vested interest in this because from my early days in politics I worked closely with members of the VECs. My father was a member of a VEC for many years. Given how we are proceeding, I wish to acknowledge those people. The Minister over his long career in politics and other Deputies, like myself, will have known people who were members of VECs. Indeed, some of the Deputies might have been members of VECs. Great work was done by the people in VECs, and that should be acknowledged on the floor of this House. The people who are still alive should be thanked and the families of those who have passed on should know from the record of the House that I, and I know I speak for everybody else, respected them for the work they did. They were very committed to the job and were proud of the role they fulfilled in the education process. I will speak a little about how things are changing so fast. We are not simply doing away with VECs but a myriad of things is coming together to take their place. While I am happy with that, the opposite decision to this is the Government's recent announcement about the abolition of town councils. That is a retrograde step and I will not support it. Sometimes the Government Ministers might get things right, but at other times they get them wrong.

When it comes to linking up the training process, we must liaise with potential employers. We live in an era of constant upskilling. The days where a person went to national school and that was it are past. Then there was the group certificate, which was enough to get a person a job working for the State in Telecom Éireann or Bord na Móna, or to secure an apprenticeship. Then the system progressed and children needed an intermediate certificate and then the leaving certificate and now it is college. Even a person in a job still needs to train. The other day I was with a doctor who has retired from public practice. He is in his 70s and every month he must go away for a few evenings a week to train and upskill. There are other doctors like him in their 80s who still operate private practices and they must constantly train in new methods. That is the world we live in today. It is not a case of being educated and finding a job, and that is the end of it. The whole area is evolving and what is before us might be right for now but in a couple of years' time further change will be needed. Liaising with potential employers is vital. We do not want to churn out people for the sake of it; we want to ensure the skills they learn will equip them to find work. Tús is a great scheme but 12 months after joining it, the person is dropped off the edge of a cliff and there is nothing else. We must watch what we are doing. Community employment schemes are great but we must watch what happens to people in the years ahead. It should always be about making sure people will be able to get gainful employment. Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, was in Kerry to launch a booklet by KES that for the first time brought all of the opportunities for people to upskill together in one publication. In view of the current environment, people must be versatile and say that although they might have been doing A, they must now train to do B. This booklet gave a comprehensive overview of what is available in the county. I wish those behind the booklet every success, it is a valuable publication. I would like to see the institute of technology in Tralee being granted university status. It would be good for the county and the institute and I see no reason that the IT could not do it. I read in one of the reports that there would be a projected annual saving of €3.2 million arising from these proposed measures. That is welcome but I am bothered by other issues. The Minister has tried to deal with the exorbitant cost of books. The company Educate.ie in Castleisland in County Kerry proved beyond all doubt that it can produce school books for all the different curricula at a fraction of the cost being foisted on parents of schoolchildren. The Minister has been proactive on this. We should work to reduce the cost of books because the world we are living in today is one where people can devise new and different methods of producing publications. I visited Educate.ie and saw the excellent work the company is doing. It can still provide jobs and pay people properly while supplying a quality product at a fraction of the cost previously. The changes in the junior certificate are welcome progress in the examination process. We were always told not to put our eggs in one basket. Young people face many different problems and pressures in their lives that we did not have as young people. A person could spend years studying and then when everything is supposed to be done in one week, the pressure could lead to a bad week where his results would not be a fair reflection of his ability. Continuous assessment is preferable; it is a smarter, more prudent way to adjudicate on a young person's ability to take exams over a longer time and to take into account the work over the course of the year. What weight will be given to each aspect?

I consider that to be a sensible step. Being able to afford to go to college is a serious issue for the new poor and one of the many problems they face. There are those who might have a very good job and who are on a good wages but who, because of negative equity and debt, week to week do not have enough money to keep the household going. When it comes to wanting to send their offspring to university, they would be automatically debarred from the grant. There are hardship funds in the universities but I hear that universities have a very small pool of money every year. Some years ago, so few people looked for the hardship grant that virtually every person who applied got a contribution towards their fees.There are so many people falling into that category today that the colleges cannot help them all. Those who are eligible for the grant receive the grant. In regard to the new category of people, it would appear from the outside that their parents would be able to pay for their college education but they cannot. If one was to conduct an audit of their finances, it would be proven beyond all doubt that they cannot afford to send their children to college. I have encountered cases of children who have had to take time out and go abroad to work. While I would not be slow to send a young person out to work, they have to interrupt their studies and go away for a year or two to build up some money to come home and return to college. That is happening a good deal. I do not know the solution but I am aware of the financial position. There may be two families living next door to each other, one of whom is on a much lower or no income, except assistance, and is able to send their children to college while the other, where a parent supposedly has a good job, is unable to do so. That is a new problem. Even going back to the 1980s, Ministers for Education did not have to deal with that problem. Also at that time there was not the same number of students going on to third level education. I believe no other Minister for Education and Skills has had to deal with this new issue. Speaking at the IVEA congress, the general secretary, Mr. Michael Moriarty, expressed the opinion that there may be great potential to enhance the range of benefits for all providers. He suggested that the education and training boards could, for example, support stand alone boards of management in other schools in regard to the management of building projects and in the provision of IT supports. He also pointed out that some VECs provide psychological support services and suggested that there may be potential for extending such roles to all schools within an education and training board catchment area. He also emphasised the benefits that could accrue from co-operation, particularly in the current constrained economic circumstances, and expressed the hope that the future ETB structure would provide the local framework to facilitate a more co-operative approach between school managers.  The matter of psychological support services raises another issue which has been debated here forcefully, that of career guidance teachers and the recent reduction in same in all schools. That is an issue of serious concern. Career guidance teachers were given a wrong title as their role involved much more than career guidance. Their role expanded to assisting young people in difficulty. The young person who was in a dark place could speak to the career guidance teacher who would give the individual time and could be of assistance at a critical time in that young person's life. I do not wish to refer to recent events but the Minister will be aware of occurrences in certain parts of the country which were alarming. It related to the lack of provision of a career guidance teacher or another suitably qualified person to deal with a young person's situation. That is a concern. Psychological support services are very important. Young people going through the education system are in a funny place in comparison to where we would have been when going through the education system. Given the alarming increase in suicide, young people get distracted, mithered and upset and need a level of support that would not have been required in the past. It is an awful thing to say but it is the truth - in the past people had a tougher mentality and it took a good deal to rattle them, whereas today young people appear to get upset more easily. Leaving the local national school and entering secondary school is a daunting proposition for children.

At secondary school they have a longer day and are meeting all new young people. The work ethic is great in such schools and the curriculum large. They are well educated but in its own way that brings psychological pressures to bear on them which they may not be able to deal with. There is also something we never dreamt of, bullying on mobile telephones, e-mails and so on. There are awful pressures on children. We may think technology is great but when we hear the stories about cyber bullying we have to ask what we have done to ourselves and our lovely young people. That is where we are in the world and we must ensure the providers of education are doing their best to combat it. The aim of the Minister and each of us and those who provide education to our young people is to ensure they are safe, happy and educated and throughout their lives that they continue to be upskilled by the various arms of the State and that they will be available to assist them all the days of their lives. I refer to my earlier point about doctors who at 70 and 80 years of age are still being educated. That is an eye opener that people are on a life long learning curve.

The new structures will be built on a remarkable foundation, that is, Ireland's proud tradition of vocational education. The new structures which the Minister is proposing are necessary. These measures will ensure the structures are fit for purpose. They will allow for greater accountability, efficiency and co-ordination. The education and training boards with SOLAS will re-orientate a core part of the education and training system to meet the unique challenges which Ireland faces. These combined measures will place further education and training within the one educational framework and offer full educational recognition to further education and training courses, which is a welcome and progressive step. The VECs work with and within the communities and have always been responsive to community needs. The reduced number of education and training boards, 16, which will replace 33 vocational education committees, will pose a challenge to this but one which can be overcome. The core purpose of the Bill is to reform the structures with the aim of addressing the low scale and size of operations of some VECs. The Minister has said that these new structures will "strengthen locally managed education". They will position the vocational sector for further growth. However, structures do not make values. In creating these new structures, we must not abandon the values, practices, philosophy and traditions of what went before in the long distinguished history of vocational education provision. This transition from a system of VECs to the new ETBs is the latest stage of the development of vocational education in Ireland, which dates back far beyond the Vocational Education Act 1930 to a new vision for education, which emerged in Europe in the mid-19th century. This vision is as valid today as it was then and has served the sector very well. The VECs have been animated by this history of educational thought and philosophy, and by the values and ethos traditionally identified with the sector - openness, democratic nature, inclusiveness, responsiveness and accessibility. It is vital that this history and these values be transmitted in this legislation so that they animate the new structures. Over the years, the VEC has delivered so much, in Dublin and in other communities across the country. The vocational sector has been by far the most inclusive and egalitarian provider of education. The VEC will not exclude anyone and no one has ever been turned away from the gate. The VECs are broad-based, democratically accountable and firmly entrenched in the communities in which they operate. The new measures the Minister proposes will maintain and enhance this democratic link to local authorities and communities. Most importantly, the VECs have always operated with a focus on the needs of the community and the needs of the labour market. Classroom practices have a clear eye to future employment patterns. They engage with different aspects of young people's formation and development - not only academic, but also practical, technological and artistic - and are always responsive to the changing needs of the labour market. The VECs have a track record of successfully straddling that continuum of education, training and employability. They have pulled these three aspects together in a very dynamic, creative, purposeful and productive way. Given the chronic unemployment that faces a generation of young people and the need to re-orientate our education system to meet the evolving needs of the workforce, many lessons can be learned from the VECs. I wish to mention the work of City of Dublin VEC in the past with the establishment of successful colleges that are now household names, including Kevin Street, Bolton Street, the College of Art and Design and the College of Music. That flair and imagination that typified the vocational sector in the past still lives on, and today is exemplified by the ground-breaking and award winning work in the fields of film­making and animation in Ballyfermot College of Further Education. As the VECs evolve and become education and training boards, the flexibility and responsiveness which has been at the core of vocational education in the past will prove invaluable into the future. When this issue came before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection last November, I asked the Minister if he would consider overtly stating the values and tradition of vocational sector in this legislation. It is essential that a statement articulating the values, traditions and philosophy of vocational education be incorporated into this new legislation so that the strength and vision of the old can animate the new. I ask the Minister to consider introducing a preamble to the Bill to include a statement of these values, traditions and strengths. I congratulate the Minister on his work in reforming our education system. Reform is good and necessary. However, in this quest for reform we must not lose sight of what is good, what the past has to teach us and what works. We must build on it and take it to the next level. The VECs represent some of the very best of our education system. The education and training boards must build on that tradition.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012. In these challenging times the way we manage education through VECs and other schools needs to change. Yesterday, we discussed the reform of local government and today we are discussing the reform of how VECs are managed. These are examples of the Government facing up to the reality that we need to do things differently and better. I welcome the streamlining of the management of vocational schools as provided for in the Bill. There were proposals to amalgamate the VECs in Tipperary and Waterford, but now it has been confirmed that south and north Tipperary will be amalgamated, which will have a positive effect on the management of schools across the county. Those are very effective institutions which play a great role in educating many people in the county. I wish to refer to areas in which the VECs have excelled in the past, which is in adult education and education for people who are out of work or want to change their careers. More than 400,000 people are unemployed. Many skilled people from the construction industry now have no work or opportunity. There is a real challenge for the country and the Minister for Education and Skills is prepared to face the challenge to re-educate, retrain and refocus all those people. We all know them and they do not want to be unemployed. They had a good standard of living some years ago but it has been taken from them because the entire industry collapsed. We need to stand up to that challenge and find opportunities for those people because there are opportunities. We could be negative and say nothing is happening and the situation in the country is deteriorating. However, by way of an example to counter that, the ICT sector has 3,000 unfilled jobs. I could see opportunities to retrain all those unemployed people. There is considerable involvement in the agricultural sector in my county. We have challenges to educate more young farmers. Quotas will disappear in coming years, beef markets are opening up and alternative organic food can be produced. Beyond the farm gate there are great opportunities for employment but we need to upskill people to have them ready to take up those opportunities. Ireland is becoming more competitive in tourism than we were and there are opportunities for more tourists to visit. However, we need to educate those unemployed people to become guides or get involved in other opportunities in the tourism sector. That is the challenge for the adult education sector. We need to open up in those three areas to educate the unemployed people in the areas of agriculture, tourism and IT in order to take large numbers of people off our dole queues which would in turn lead to a more prosperous Ireland. At the end of the day, the challenge to create jobs in the coming years will be immense. However, we cannot face that challenge without educated people. That is why the Bill is so important. We need to face the challenge and I know the Minister for Education and Skills is up to it.

Previous speakers also referred to the fact that we have numerous Bills dealing with the VECs. There have been efforts made across different Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Education and Skills and others, to update and consolidate various pieces of legislation into one piece of primary legislation, which, too, is to be welcomed. The primary thrust of this legislation is to bring about a change in the structure of the VECs across the country by way of reduction in numbers and amalgamation, which I welcome. Reform has been mentioned a great deal in this debate. Reform of the education sector is badly needed. I join Deputy Tom Hayes in commending the Minister, who is a man determined to proceed with a number of reforms and is doing a good job at it, on his work thus far. I wish him luck in his work, in respect of which he will have my support. I would like to put a couple of specific questions in regard to the new VEC structure for Carlow and Kilkenny to the Minister although I will not be able to remain in the House to hear his response as I have to leave to attend a meeting. I have been approached by a number of people who work for the VEC in Kilkenny who are interested in knowing when the new amalgamated structures will come into force.

Questions have also arisen in regard to the allocation of sub-offices to particular parts of the country and not to others. Carlow-Kilkenny, which politically has been one constituency in all bar two or three elections since the foundation of the State, is an obvious choice for an amalgamated VEC. Also, a number of other services serve both counties. As such, it makes sense they would also share this service. Like other speakers, I, too, would like to speak about the education sector in the context of the juncture of this country at present. I often speak of the need for Government and education to be responsive to industry. However, education is about more than just the economy and trade union and industry representatives. There is much more to going to school, be it primary, second or third level, than just examinations. I welcome the Minister's recent announcement in regard to reform of the junior certificate, which we will have an opportunity to discuss at a later stage. Concerns have been raised with me, although not by teachers, with regard to the possibility of subjects such as history not being as prominent in the future for students in the junior cycle. However, I hope to have an opportunity at a later date to discuss this further with the Minister. As the Minister knows only too well, education is not only about meeting the needs of the economy. While that is crucially important, education is also about ensuring we have responsible citizens.  I would like at this stage to comment on the important role played by VECs in the country. Deputies Conaghan and Humphreys spoke specifically in their contributions about VECs in Dublin. There is an old building in virtually every rural parish or community, not least in my own area, which once housed the local technical college. My late father, who was born in the 1920s, never received a secondary education but attended the old technical college in Listrolin, which has been closed for many years now. My father, his friends and many of his neighbours took part in educational courses at that technical college, which fulfilled an important role. While there are no longer technical colleges in every rural community, what is provided for in this legislation is an update of the old technical schools. As stated by Deputy Tom Hayes, it is important these types of facilities are available to people who left the construction and other sectors and wish to retrain or upskill and also, as stated by Deputy Conaghan, to people who may have a third level qualification but wish to fill gaps in their education. The role of the VECs in filling these gaps is crucially important. I welcome this Bill.

I did my H.Dip in the local VEC school in Naas, following which I spent a year teaching in the VEC school in Maynooth, which was an enjoyable experience from which I learned a great deal about the workings of the VEC. When my mother passed away, I was co-opted onto the VEC, from which I learned a great deal about the workings of the board. When I was asked in 1999 to again become a member of the board of the VEC, I declined because I believed at that time - perhaps I was a young headless chicken and am now an older headless chicken - that the board did not have any real role in the running of the VEC. For this reason, I welcome the dramatic changes that are proposed, not alone the change proposed by the Minister in this legislation, but the changes in local government proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, which link directly into this legislation. I would like to speak about two issues, the first of which is the new boards. The legislation stipulates that populations will dictate from where the local authority board members will come. I am thinking in this regard of my own area of Kildare-Wicklow. The Minister might consider also taking into account the number of VEC education facilities in one county versus another county. While the population of each county might be the same, the number of schools in a particular county would be more relevant. I hope the Minister will take that point on board.

A person nominated to the board of the VEC in Kildare could not take up his position because he was of the wrong gender. This may become an issue in terms of what is provided for in this Bill. I am aware that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has introduced changes in this regard. However, they will not come into force until after the 2014 local elections. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, when making the regulations, might also address the issue of gender balance on the boards. The legislation provides board members with more power, which I welcome. Members of local authorities do not realise how much power they have. It is important this is pointed out to them. I have raised with the Department of Education and Skills its awarding, under its tendering process, of contracts to build schools to companies whom the dogs in the street know are going to fail. I welcome that decisions in respect of the borrowing of money must come before the educational training boards. I would welcome positive input from board members in terms of examination of interested parties. On the question of amalgamation, we previously amalgamated our health boards.Instead of having 12 slim trim health boards, we had one bloated HSE. I welcome the provision for staff to transfer to training boards or other public service bodies. It is important that what we put together is not like the bloated HSE and that we have slim, trim, fighting education and training boards designed for what is required in their communities without excess staff. The Bill is excellent and I support it wholeheartedly. I love the reforms being made not only by the Minister for Education and Skills, but also by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.

Prior to my election to the Dáil, I had the pleasure of serving as a member of Monaghan VEC and I can confirm that VECs have made a significant contribution to education at local level. The Bill will bring together a number of VECs, including the two county VECs in Cavan and Monaghan. I have no doubt that with the right leadership the joint VEC for Cavan and Monaghan will have the capacity to take on additional functionality and provide additional services to all schools in the remit of the education and training boards. It will continue to expand and support education in the region. Support can be given in a wide range of areas, including synergies in ICT through amalgamation and shared services. HR support and industrial relations issues can also be supported by the new education and training boards. These are all specialised areas and most individual schools would prefer to be supported on a centralised basis. It will also create opportunities to achieve savings. We live in a more complex world and more and more we need a specialised and expertise-based approach, particularly in HR which we all know is highly specialised. I agreed with the Minister when he stated this type of support service should be expanded and offered to primary schools. Support could also be provided for the procurement of goods and services and building projects, which is another specialised area. It is difficult for school principals to balance their teaching duties with a building project. Under the education and training boards, the amalgamated VECs will have great opportunities to provide support and services. The best example is in my constituency is the ongoing construction of the new education campus in Monaghan, which I know the Minister has visited. It comprises 16 classrooms for Gaelscoil Ultain, a post-primary school for Coláiste Oiriall, and the 700 student Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training, MIFET. It also includes a theatre which received funding through co-operation between Monaghan Town Council, Monaghan County Council, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Education and Skills. It is a good example of organisations coming together and achieving great things. The Garage Theatre in Monaghan is a pioneering project in that it will have a dual purpose. At night it will be a theatre and during the day it will be used by students studying drama and theatre in the institute of further education, thereby maximising use of the facility. The new education campus is the largest school building project in the State this year and it is a tremendous asset to the town of Monaghan. It is being built on the site of the old Army barracks. I pay tribute to the CEO of Monaghan VEC, Martin O'Brien, and all the members of Monaghan VEC who have worked tirelessly to ensure the project is almost completed. It is a pilot project which was devolved to Monaghan VEC to develop the mechanisms and standards by which further projects could be devolved. The aim of the project was to afford the VEC the opportunity to demonstrate what it could do at local level. In this respect, Monaghan VEC has proven beyond any doubt that the system can be a success. While change brings challenges, major opportunities exist for the new education and training boards. I welcome the fact that the Bill makes provision for representation from all parties in the entity, with staff, parent and community representatives as well as elected representatives. It is very important that all of these parties are represented. The future success of education will also be in patrons joining together to provide a broad and balanced curriculum, and education and training boards can also play an important role in facilitating school amalgamations. We have a perfect example of this in Clones, County Monaghan, which had a small VEC school and a small secondary school with the bishop as patron. The two patrons came together and the result is that we have an excellent school in Clones in Largy College. It is a model of good practice and an example of co-operation between church and State. The new education and training boards will have an important role in education and they will be able to provide support in many aspects of the education system. They have broad range of skills which can be relied upon and used to the advantage of everyone. For the new education and training boards to be successful and effective, the Minister and departmental officials need to show leadership and be confident enough to assign meaningful functions and responsibilities to the new boards, and use their skills, experience, interest, commitment and enthusiasm to the maximum so that education can thrive. I commend the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and the large amount of work he and the Department have done to reform the education system.

The House will be aware the McCarthy report in 2008 recommended the reduction of VECs and other associated local government committees and organisations. Originally a reduction of 22 was mooted. However, the previous Government decided on 16, with which this Government agreed, and we now have the proposal set out in the Bill. I warmly welcome the evolution from the vocational educational bodies which dealt only with education to educational and training boards. This will see the eventual amalgamation of the FÁS training division into the local education and training boards. It is prudent to have vocational and skills training under one roof. I look forward to further legislation later this year which will establish SOLAS to oversee the educational and training boards and provide a co-ordinated structure for the best delivery of skills training and local education. As Members are aware, it is proposed is to bring the FÁS training centres under these local educational and training boards, which makes fundamental sense because some early school leavers from the current VEC school structure can be attracted to follow up on a trade skill such as carpentry or plumbing or to become electricians to ensure that they do not leave the education and training board structure devoid of a skill in the blue collar workplace. The transfer of the current 16 FÁS training centres to the education and training boards is significant. At present, FÁS targets up to 87,000 learners annually, with an average of 22,000 learners participating monthly. The responsibility for this training will now rest with the education and training boards, which will mean the footprint of the education and training boards will be pronounced in their local communities as they will have greatly extended responsibilities across the entire spectrum of education and training. In the past, as a member of Sligo VEC I witnessed the great work done at local level by teaching staff, principals and VEC administration staff to develop and expand the VEC school network. VEC members comprising staff and community, teacher and local public representatives drove the educational agenda throughout Ireland. Adult educational courses, evening courses and post-leaving certificate courses were all sought by members and pursued by school principals resulting in the retraining and upskilling of many people in society, especially in rural areas throughout Ireland.This has enabled many people to enter, and indeed re-enter, the workforce with renewed skills and confidence, and we can thank our vocational educational committees for this. It is acknowledged that the connection with local authorities and VECs will be severed and the new ETBs will be an agency of the Department. Yesterday, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, announced a massive change in the structures of local government, and it is significant that we also see the formal severing of relationships between local authorities and local educational boards through this Bill. My constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim will be affiliated with the new Sligo-Leitrim-Mayo education and training board. This is a vast area, ranging from the Cavan border as far as Achill in County Mayo and from the Longford border to Ballinrobe in County Mayo, and I have concerns about the geographical spread of such a large region. I am aware the population is sparse but this occupies a land mass of about 15% of the country. With almost 20 post-primary schools, this new regional structure is a mammoth task for the staff from the three counties and, indeed, for the incoming CEO to manage. Section 38 confers on the Minister power to inquire into the performance of an ETB. This provision allows the Minister to appoint an investigator to carry out an investigation into the performance by the board of general or specific functions. The investigator, having taken the ETB's views into account, will submit a final report of his or her investigation to the Minister. In this, there is no proposal by the Minister to review the proposed structures after a prescribed timeframe. I am anxious to see a review of these structures within two years and I ask the Minister to ensure evaluations are done on all 16 ETBs to ensure all counties, especially the smaller ones, and existing schools get a fair crack of the whip in respect of funding and services from the ETBs. I note the boards will have 18 members. There were many submissions to the Oireachtas committee which recommended that the composition of the boards should differ in various ways from that proposed in the general scheme of the Bill. For example, the Irish Vocational Education Association recommended that the ETBs comprise 21 members where the ETB is established through the amalgamation of two VECs, and 24 members where the ETB is established through the amalgamation of three VECs. However, the Bill as published retains the overall composition proposed in the general scheme. I ask the Minister to reflect on this on Committee Stage in order that where three counties have been amalgamated, he would look at increasing the membership to 21 to allow for three more local authority members as representatives on the board. This would ensure a more balanced regional representation at board level and allow fair representation for counties like Leitrim, for example, which have a large geographical area but a smaller population and a strong pupil number at the current VEC level. I am glad to say my Government, under the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, has set out a clear path forward for education at this level. Mr. Michael Moriarty, CEO of the Irish Vocational Education Association, stated recently: "The re-focus of F[urther] E[ducation and] T[raining] on the world of work and the skills needs of job seekers and other learners will streamline a more efficient service, from government policy level, to SOLAS strategic level, to Education and Training Board (ETB) implementation level." This is a significant endorsement of Government strategy which effectively sees the break-up of FÁS and the establishment of the national employment and entitlements service, to be managed by the Department of Social Protection. This is a one-stop-shop to support people in establishing their benefits entitlements, advise them about their training options and assist them in securing employment. It is high time this level of reform was established in our country considering our difficulty with almost 438,000 people out of work. I strongly believe this reforming Bill will provide the foundation for a fresh start on tackling long-term unemployment and I commend this legislation to the House.

This Bill will provide for the establishment of the education and training boards which will replace the existing 33 vocational education committees. This reform process is part of the programme for Government. It promised to review and streamline State institutions to make them more effective and ensure they provide better value for money. Many organisations like the VECs are in need of this type of overhaul. The national circumstances and the educational requirements of citizens have changed drastically since the establishment of the VECs. In establishing the education and training boards, the Bill gives the Minister the opportunity to reform and modernise their governance. It will remove outdated technology and clearly lay out the functions of the new boards. This will reflect the changes that have taken place in society and education generally. The Minister emphasises the new system to be established will strengthen locally managed education. It will enhance the scale of local education and training. The rationalisation represents a major component of the public service transformation agenda. The composition of the new boards is a recognition by the Minister of the contribution made to the VECs by locally elected representatives. The proposal is that ten out of 18 members will be local authority representatives. It is equally important that the board will include two parent representatives and four members from bodies that represent community and business interests. This will underpin local democracy participation and will also provide valuable knowledge that outside organisations can bring to the board. It should be remembered that this legislation only deals with the re-organisation of VECs. The Minister intends to initiate other legislation to provide for the new education and training authority to be known as SOLAS. This will provide for the dissolution of FÁS and the transfer of its training centres to the newly established ETBs. This will give more rationalisation and co-ordination in the whole sector, which is very welcome. Section 10 sets out the function of the education and training boards. It clearly demonstrates the intention of this Bill to rationalise and strengthen all the services. There has been a lot of duplication, with each VEC having its own HR department, finance department and payroll department. Section 20 facilitates the ETBs in co-operating with each other in the performance of their duties. This section allows the Minister to direct ETBs to perform a function jointly. This process of rationalisation has begun with the establishment of one centre for processing and granting third level education grants. Until recently, each county council and VEC had departments doing this job separately. In current economic circumstances, we must achieve the most effective outcomes for what are now scarce resources. This Bill allows for this implementation. Co-operation and sharing of data between all State agencies must be the order of the day if we are to create an effective empowered public service. Accountability and transparency is a strong commitment in the programme for Government as well as effectiveness and this Bill has built in articles to ensure this happens. This Bill ticks many of the boxes. It rationalises services and saves money and is designed to produce more effectiveness which will produce better outcomes for Irish citizens. It provides mechanisms for transparency and openness. These are essential in the new type of governance being advanced by all members of this Government. I commend this Bill to the House.

We have had more than 20 contributions from different Deputies. Deputy Áine Collins has simply confirmed that the response has been broadly very welcoming. It is significant but not surprising that many of the people who spoke were themselves former members of a VEC board and, therefore, have an intimate knowledge of it. It is intended that this legislation would be both an enabling and reforming legal instrument. All Deputies have paid tribute to the role played by VECs both in the education sector and in society. Flexibility and responsiveness to change and emerging needs has been a defining feature of the operation of the VECs going back to the 1930s. Deputies Anthony Lawlor and John Paul Phelan referred to this. A key strategic consideration informing the restructuring of the VECs is the need to retain and support this demonstrated capacity. We must also ensure the VEC sector is positioned to meet future challenges across the education and training sector. Deputy McConalogue said the new education and training boards, which originated under his party's Government with the former Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe, must be about providing a better service, ensuring stronger links with employers and delivering value for money. Deputy O'Brien for Sinn Féin referred to the need to strike a balance between securing efficiencies, maximising effectiveness and ensuring those within the sector have a rewarding experience. Deputy Boyd Barrett perhaps put it more succinctly by saying that it is important we get this right.It is important that we get this right. I agree wholeheartedly with these sentiments and believe the Bill will deliver on these goals. There are a number of issues raised by the Deputies to which I want to refer. The issue of ensuring representation of local parents on education and training boards was raised by a number of Deputies. We have moved away from the existing system of elections to one of nominations from national associations of parents. This is because of the very cumbersome procedures that are currently in place. However, in moving to a system of nominations, we will not be diluting the local dimension of parental representation; rather, we will be strengthening it. Under the current legislation, the two parents' representatives are elected by parents of VEC students but do not themselves have to be parents of a student. Under the Bill's proposals, the two parents' representatives must be parents of students currently registered in an ETB school or centre. With regard to business and learner representation, the most significant issue on which submissions were made on the general scheme of the Bill, before it came to this House, was that of the composition of the new boards. I want to ensure that the new bodies are effective and efficient. In trying to accommodate too many interests, we run the risk of undermining their efficiency. However, the need for representation on education and training boards of particular groups, specifically those representing learners and business interests, was a strong and recurring theme in today's debate. I will, therefore, reflect further on this between now and Committee Stage. Deputies McConalogue and Bannon spoke about the need to bring together the further education and training sector in its own right, as did many other Deputies later this afternoon. This is the basis on which the decision to establish SOLAS was made. It will be a single national agency to provide overall strategic direction for further education and training policy. It will work with the new network of 16 education and training boards, which will provide the local and regional expertise in order to enhance the service and experience of learners. Some concern was expressed that SOLAS could be competing with education and training boards in various parts of the country. The further education sector is the only sector that does not have a co-ordinated and clear role with the backup of an agency to implement and augment what it wants to do with delivery agents on the ground. In a sense, SOLAS will be for the further education area what the HEA is for higher education. There is no college with a notice stating "HEA college". The HEA is the policy body in addition to having financial and other roles. The role of SOLAS will not be precisely the same as that of the HEA but, in terms of the identity on the ground, there will not be a SOLAS identity in the education and further education sectors. That will be branded by the name of the local education and training boards in the 16 areas in which they are to be located. The published Bill differs from the general scheme by including provisions which reflect the role education and training boards will have in regard to skills training and learners. I hope to introduce legislation to establish SOLAS later this session. As I said in an interjection this morning, this will be a much tighter and smaller Bill than the legislation involving the consolidation of nine items of primary legislation plus many statutory instruments associated with the work of the VECs over 80 years. The SOLAS legislation will be enabling legislation. I intend to have it brought before the House so it will nearly run in tandem with this debate. I hope that, with the co-operation of the Houses, both Bills will be passed with the intention of activating them as soon as possible in January of next year. The issue of savings was raised by a number of Deputies. It was asked whether this is the raison d'être of the Bill. Clearly, the Bill will deliver savings but its real potential is to tap into the skills and experiences in the sector by augmenting the functions of the VECs. I hope the incentive for such rationalisation will be that savings that are secured in this area will be retained within the education and training board sector. The basis for the proposed changes in the VEC structure has a direct resonance with the strategic objectives of the reforming public service agenda. Deputy Tom Hayes referred to that in regard to the local authority reforms announced yesterday. Through the changes proposed, the sector can be enabled to contribute more significantly in terms of driving improved outcomes for education and training provision within its schools and centres and in other programmes. Many Deputies, including Deputy Heather Humphreys, talked about the desirability of shared services. Without in any way threatening any other sector of the education system at either primary or secondary level, I hope there will be some sharing of services - in respect of IR, the temporary provision of staff should somebody call in sick, or the small building programme, for example - so that teachers can concentrate on being teachers. I refer in particular to principals of relatively small primary schools. Managing a small building works programme over the summer takes up all their time, bearing in mind that their skill may not necessarily be project management. The current VECs, as I said in my opening speech, are delivering on the ground, very effectively in some cases. Reference was made to the campus in Monaghan. There is a similar one in County Louth and there are examples in Kildare and elsewhere. There may be an Educate Together school, Gaelscoil and second level school on the one campus, with each sharing facilities. This makes a lot of sense. The last succinct point made by Deputy Michael Conaghan, a former chairman of CDVEC in addition to being a lecturer or teacher in one of its further education colleges, was on the values of the VEC sector. The Deputy spoke somewhat nostalgically but very assertively about the need to allow somewhere in the legislation capacity for the VEC sector, as we still call it, to state very clearly its ethos or values. There is such provision in regard to primary schools as there is an ethos that animates the primary schools under various patrons. It may be about language, religion or multidenominationalism. In the free voluntary sector, there are similar declarations of values or ethos as an integral part of what the education system is for those schools. This is because education is not value-free, nor is it just about preparing people for the labour market. In response to what Deputy Conaghan said and to references to a less explicitly stated sense of the role of VECs and their relationship with the communities in which they are located, perhaps I could make provision in the legislation. We can talk about it on Committee Stage. I do not believe we will have 16 different sets of values. Perhaps the IVEA could be invited to facilitate a discussion on this. Perhaps we could have an enabling provision in the legislation, formulated on Committee Stage, that would enable the education and training boards to indicate unambiguously the educational ethos or set of values in primary, secondary and further-education levels. The one body will span all three sectors. There is no other integrated institution that will actually have that range and cover. I referred a number of times to the VEC sector. What I am doing in this Bill is creating a new structure for the education and training sector, as reflected in the Title of the Bill. In so doing, we will be ensuring that the sector is enabled to meet the considerable challenges that now arise and will arise. I look forward to further engagement with all the Members who have been engaged in this debate. I thank everybody for his contribution and commend the Bill to the House.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I welcome the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of this Bill, which will introduce a system of generic substitution and reference pricing for prescribed drugs and medicines. These reforms will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for medicines, resulting in savings for taxpayers and patients. The Bill sets out the Government's proposals to allow the substitution of medicines by pharmacists at a patient's request and to improve and update the statutory basis for the supply of medicines and other prescribed items under the General Medical Services, GMS, and community drugs schemes. It sets out a clear legislative basis for the supply and reimbursement of items to patients under both schemes. It also sets out criteria that the HSE must take into account when making reimbursement decisions. The Bill will allow the HSE to attach conditions to the supply of certain items, provided that any restriction is evidence based and in the interests of patients and value for money. However, it is important to note that the Bill does not change the existing arrangements for the supply of items through community pharmacies. The Bill is patient focused and will allow patients to continue to be able to access prescribed medicines in line with their clinical requirements. In addition, if a particular brand of medicine is required by a patient for clinical reasons, he or she will face no additional charge for it. In the current economic climate, it is important that we take every step possible to provide public services efficiently, limit costs to the greatest extent possible and involve the users of resources in better understanding the value of those resources and their appropriate use. Public expenditure on drugs provided to patients under the GMS and other community drugs schemes has increased significantly in the past decade, with the year-on-year increase in spending on medicines among the highest in Europe. In 1998, we spent just under €400 million in this regard. By 2009, expenditure had increased to just over €2 billion. However, due to action taken by my Department and the HSE, expenditure reduced in 2010 and 2011, with expenditure of approximately €1.9 billion in the latter. Several factors drive increases in expenditure on drugs. The number of items prescribed has increased in the past decade from approximately 30 million to approximately 70 million in 2010, general practitioners, GPs, are prescribing newer, more expensive products, and greater numbers of people are eligible for medical cards. My Department and the HSE have taken a number of actions to control expenditure on drugs. Savings are being achieved through ongoing off-patent price cuts agreed with pharmaceutical manufacturers, the pricing mechanism for new products has been changed and we now have a review mechanism that takes account of price reductions in other countries. Since 2010, these actions have achieved savings in the region of €250 million. In 2009 and 2011, regulations were made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to address margins and mark-ups in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The combined full year savings from these measures amount to €154 million. My Department and the HSE have had ongoing negotiations with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, throughout 2012 with the intention of securing a new pricing and supply agreement to replace the recent agreement, which expired on 1 March. The terms of the previous agreement and savings secured under it continued to apply for the duration of the negotiations. In June, an interim agreement with the IPHA to reduce the price of certain off-patent medicines was reached and is expected to deliver €10 million in savings in 2012 or €20 million in a full year. These price reductions were implemented in advance of further discussions on a new agreement that was expected to deliver more significant savings. As the House will be aware, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, announced on Monday that intensive negotiations involving the IPHA, the HSE and the Department of Health had reached a successful conclusion with a major deal on the cost of drugs in the State. The deal is an important step in reducing the cost base of the health system. With a value in excess of €400 million over the next three years, the deal will entail significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill for the State; greater access to new cutting edge drugs for certain conditions; and an easing of future financial pressures on the health services. In broad terms, approximately half of the financial value of the deal relates to reductions in the cost of patent and off-patent drugs while the other half is related to the State securing the provision of new and innovative drugs for the duration of the agreement in an exceptionally difficult economic climate. The new deal, when combined with the IPHA deal reached earlier this year, means that €16 million in drug savings will be made this year, with much greater savings to be achieved during the next three years. It is estimated that the deal will generate savings of up to €116 million gross in 2013. I warmly welcome this agreement. The current cost of drugs in our health system at over €2 billion per year represents a major challenge to the State. However, the value of life saving and life enhancing drugs to patients is incalculable. The importance of the new deal to the State and patients alike will be felt into the future. In addition to the IPHA deal, the Department and the HSE will shortly finalise discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI, which represents the generic industry, to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. A national task force on prescribing and dispensing has been established to deal with prescribing and dispensing existing medicines. It will address these issues from the perspective of quality and patient safety primarily. However, it can be anticipated that the work of the task force will also deliver significant cost savings in terms of achieving more cost conscious prescribing. Therefore, the task force provides a platform to secure a sustainable means of improving value for money from the significant expenditure of the State on prescribed medicines. The task force comprises a number of key leaders in the health care system. Its terms of reference require it to oversee and direct analysis of the extensive information that is held on prescribing patterns through the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS. The task force's work will be wide ranging and include providing advice, guidance and support to prescribers and dispensers to help them improve prescribing practices. Its work will also include assessing the suitability of maintaining the supply of certain items with limited efficacy where more appropriate items are available. Despite the progress I have outlined, pharmaceutical expenditure continues to pose a challenge, particularly in light of our ageing population and increased usage of medicines. Further changes in the form of generic substitution and reference pricing are required to secure a sustainable system of pharmaceutical expenditure while ensuring that patients can continue to have access to necessary and innovative medicines. Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent at the patient's request when a more expensive product has been prescribed. Generic medicines are equally as safe and efficacious as proprietary products and are subject to the same requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, will have responsibility for the designation of interchangeable medicines. Reference pricing involves setting a common reimbursement amount for selected groups of medicines. Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State. Eligible patients can avoid out-of-pocket payments by opting for a generic medicine at or below the reference price. Coupled with generic substitution, reference pricing provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product, but does not impose any unavoidable additional cost on them. These two measures represent a significant structural change to the system of pricing and reimbursement of medicines. As more medicines come off patent, the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing will ensure that both taxpayers and patients will benefit from increased competition in the pharmaceutical market. Giving patients more choice and promoting price competition between suppliers will help to reduce the overall drugs bill without compromising the efficacy or safety of the treatment that patients receive. Savings will be achieved by limiting reimbursement to the reference price, allowing patients to opt for less expensive versions of the prescribed medicine and promoting price competition between the manufacturers of interchangeable medicines. The level of savings will be dependent on a range of factors, including the number of medicines included in the reference price system, prescribing practices and the behaviour of manufacturers of interchangeable medicines. As the system will be introduced on a phased basis, savings will also be achieved on a phased basis. I turn now to the main provisions of the Bill. Part 1 provides for the definition of certain terms used in the Bill and the laying of regulations. Part 2 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a list of interchangeable medicinal products, setting out the duties of pharmacists regarding prescriptions for interchangeable medicinal products under their branded names and including a number of scenarios. It also sets out the duties of pharmacists regarding prescriptions for interchangeable medicinal products under their common names. Part 2 also contains some miscellaneous provisions. These include the provision that no action or other proceeding shall be instituted against a pharmacist or prescriber when a pharmacist substitutes a medicinal product for a branded interchangeable medicinal product in accordance with the legislation. Also included is the provision that a prescriber may indicate on a prescription if a branded interchangeable medicinal product should not be substituted for clinical reasons. Part 3 provides for the dispensing of medicinal products under their common names where they are not interchangeable medicinal products. Part 4 provides for the establishment and maintenance of the reimbursement list. It also provides for the conditional supply of listed items by the HSE and the setting of prices for items and listed items. This part of the Bill provides the HSE with discretion to supply non-listed items to certain patients. Part 5 provides for the setting of a reference price for groups of interchangeable medicinal products. Part 6 provides for appeals to the High Court against relevant decisions of the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, or HSE; power to specify form of documents; fees to be paid to the IMB or the HSE; and amendments to relevant Acts. Schedules 1 and 2 pertain to procedural provisions relating to decisions by the IMB or the HSE. Schedule 3 sets out criteria for the purposes of decision making by the HSE under section 18. Two issues were to the fore when the Bill was being drafted. The first was the sustainability of the supply of medicines and the other was the safety of generic medicines. Shortages of essential medicines are currently a cause of concern not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and the rest of the world. It is a global problem affecting health systems in all countries and affecting patients worldwide. Medicines shortages can be caused by a combination of factors throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain, such as manufacturing difficulties, industry consolidation and commercial decisions by manufacturers to withdraw unprofitable lines. Irish medicines regulations place an obligation on both manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers within the limits of their respective responsibilities to ensure the adequate availability and supply of medicines on the Irish market in order to meet patient needs. My Department has been engaging with the Irish Medicines Board, the Health Service Executive and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to identify ways in which the Irish system can manage medicines shortages as effectively as possible in order to minimise the impact on patients. International efforts to effectively manage medicines shortages are also being considered. Pharmaceutical production is carried out by private enterprises and the State or my Department can only intervene to a limited extent to prevent medicines shortages occurring. The IMB and HSE continue to work closely to operationally manage medicines shortages when they arise. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland works with the pharmacy profession and has recently published guidance to registered pharmacists on managing medicines shortages. Manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacies all have responsibility to work together to identify shortages quickly and implement alternative arrangements to meet the needs of patients. In this context, Section 24(3)(a) of the Bill provides that when the HSE sets a reference price or reviews a reference price for a group of interchangeable medicinal products, it must take into account the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand. In other words, reference prices will be set at levels which will facilitate rather than jeopardise supply. The safety of generic medicines underpins this Bill but it is important to point out that generic medicines must meet exactly the same standards of quality and safety and have the same effect as the original medicine. All of the generic medicines on the Irish market are required to be properly licensed and meet the requirements of the Irish Medicines Board. To further enhance the safety aspect of generic substitution, section 13 gives a prescriber the option of indicating on a prescription that a branded interchangeable medicinal product should not be substituted, if there are clinical reasons not to do so. The programme for Government includes the commitment that "reference pricing and greater use of generics will be introduced to reduce the State's large drug bill and the cost to individuals of their medicines". This legislation will introduce a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines which will ultimately lead to savings for taxpayers and patients. It is envisaged that this Bill will contribute to an increase in the rate of generic prescribing in Ireland, which currently stands at approximately 18%. I will, of course, keep the implementation of reference pricing and generic substitution under constant review and will report back to both Houses, as appropriate. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies during the course of the debate.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	243	The Minister of State is hitting the ground running in the Department. He has been there a few short days but there has been a €400 million agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and other key pieces of funding have been discovered in the latter days of this year to address the budget deficit. I compliment the Minister of State, although I am not saying it is creative accounting. It is interesting that the announcements have come when representatives of the troika are in the Department looking at the figures to see where the deficit can be addressed and how it arose in the first place. This is important legislation and we welcome it. It has been a long and drawn-out process, although I accept there were complexities in the drafting of the legislation. Broad consultation was required with the industry and everybody else to ensure the legislation would be effective and meet the needs not only of the taxpayer but the industry and, most importantly, the patients. The balance has been struck in general, although we have concerns that we will address through amendments on Committee Stage. I am hopeful we will get a fair hearing as we want to be constructive, particularly with the issue of supply and shortages. Pharmacists, for example, are concerned about a three month interpretation as opposed to a six month interpretation, and such price referencing changes could cause pharmacists and wholesalers to reduce the stock carried. It is a technical issue to be dealt with on another day. I will speak to the broader issues of the Bill. The amount of money spent by this State on medicines is alarming. There is no doubt that there are issues with cost and the amount prescribed. The Government, health policy makers, prescribers and dispensers must address the issue in the short to medium term, as it is stifling the ability of the State to fund health services. It is not good to be overly dependent on certain medicines in the prescription process. Recently we had representatives of the Irish Medicines Board before an Oireachtas health committee. Their take on the issue was interesting, and perhaps we should have a broader discussion in this regard, taking in not just this Bill but the use of interchangeables, prescription-only drugs and over the counter sales. We should also consider the role of pharmacists in the area. If a person with or without a medical card goes to a doctor, the prescription given would be dispensed by a pharmacists. Many companies do not want a drug to be taken off the reimbursement scheme so they would not even make an application in this respect. There is no form of reimbursement if it is taken from the list. If it remains on the list it must be prescribed by a doctor. There are pharmacists who have spent seven years in college, are eminently qualified and professional and yet they can have no hand, act or part in the prescription process. I would not expect pharmacists to be able to prescribe every particular medicine and drug but there should be a key role for competent professionals who are in every community in the country. They should have a more active role in prescriptions. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for primary care to be universally available, and although there is a delay in the roll-out, I understand the reasons. Those with a long-term illness will be in receipt of free GP care in the not too distant future, according to the programme for Government.The idea that all the medicines a person requires must be supplied through a prescription or there is no reimbursement is a falsehood because everyone is obliged to go to their GP. If I have a sick child, it will cost me €60 before I can get any form of medicine. I have to pay €60 every time I head to my GP to get a medicine which in other countries may possibly be prescribed and dispensed at pharmacy level. We must have a broader discussion on that. The medical profession will say it is the only one which should prescribe and that the pharmacist should dispense, but I think there is a middle ground in that pharmacists should be able to prescribe and dispense certain types drugs and medicines. I am thinking of skin ointments and other low level products that would not necessarily require a full medical check by a doctor which would cost a person without a medical card €60. It will cost the State if the person has a medical card, so either way it is costing people, either through general taxation or a direct payment to a doctor. That is an issue on which we will just have to bite the bullet. We must have a very genuine discussion on it. We talk about the pharmaceutical industry, products coming out of patent and that it may save €400 million over the next three years, which is all very welcome. However, I question whether the agreement reached the other day with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association will save that amount, but that is another day's work and it is not relevant to this Bill in legislative terms, although it has a knock-on effect. How much of that €1.9 billion cost could be avoided if a proper regime was in place which discouraged prescribing and dispensing in the first place? The amount of medicines sloshing about our systems is at the higher end in comparison with other European countries. That is a key issue and I refer not only to the cost but to the actual quantity of medicines. Those are two areas on which we should have a discussion. The Irish Medicines Board was quite clear on another issue at which we, the policymakers in the Department and the HSE, should look. There should be a review of the medicines being given to patients. For example, many patients could be on many different medications if they are very ill or require long-term treatments. The doctor prescribes and the pharmacist dispenses. There is a role here for the pharmacist who is the most eminently qualified person in terms of assessing whether medicines are overlapping. There should be a regular review of the medicines prescribed to people. We all know of cupboards full of medicines which are being prescribed and dispensed but not used. People may ask if I am sure about that. I am absolutely definite about that, as would most public representatives who would see it at the coalface. While we welcome the fact there will be reference pricing and generic substitution, we should be trying to reduce the amount of medicines and drugs we use. For all those reasons, a continuum of policy is required to get to a situation where we have a drugs Bill which is reflective of good health policy in terms of reducing the amount of medicines supplied. Many organisations and advocacy groups continually raise the issue that perhaps there is an over-reliance on drugs. The Department of Health and others have advertisements and campaigns from time to time in regard to over-reliance on antibiotics. That is just one area. There are many other areas of equal concern, including mental health, where we genuinely believe there is an overly prescriptive hand. This Bill will reduce the price to the patient and the taxpayer but there is no detail in terms of price referencing. Will it be done by statutory instrument, by regulation or by logarithm in the Department of Health? How will it come about? It is very important we have detail on this. What basket will be used by whichever person or entity we allow to strike the reference price? Perhaps it was the use of language as opposed to the interpretation of the legislation but I was concerned when the Minister of State used the words, "at the patient's request". I assume the pharmacist will recommend and that if the patient refuses, he or she should be entitled to the original medicine or drug prescribed and that there will be a role for the pharmacist to be proactive in promoting generic substitution as opposed to the patient saying he or she will take the cheapest. That is a key area which must be explored a little further, probably on Committee Stage. It would be of concern if more weight was given to the prescriber as opposed to the dispenser. That could create difficulties. We all know that pharmaceutical companies advertise their products. The Irish Medical Organisation and others have a code of conduct on how and what general practitioners prescribe and whether there are any conflicts. I am not saying every GP in the country has a conflict of interest in terms of prescribing but, at times, companies try to induce GPs to prescribe their particular drug or medicine over another. That is an area we may need to tease out on Committee Stage. The organisation, Brainwave, contacted me in regard to its concerns about generic substitutions for people with epilepsy, and I am sure it has contacted the Department and the Minister of State. I do not have any medical competency in this area but when organisations such as that express grave concerns about generic substitutions for people with epilepsy, we might look to see whether they merit further examination. There is grave concern among the community which represents people with epilepsy that this might not be suitable for their treatment and requirements. That issue might be visited at some stage in the near future because Brainwave contacted me and I received many e-mails from individuals who are concerned because they did suffer, or are suffering, from epilepsy. The Irish Medicines Board is responsible for the oversight of medicines. It seems to be very slow to delist medicines, and I raised this with Mr. O'Mahony, the chief executive of the board, at committee, as did other Deputies. Many companies will not request delisting for reimbursement reasons, but the Irish Medicines Board should be proactive in recommending the delisting of medicines and drugs from prescription to over the counter. Other countries, including the UK, seem to be more proactive in delisting medicines and drugs which prove to be safe and can be dispensed by a pharmacist without prescription. We are very slow to do that. The pharmacist should have more involvement in the amount of medicine an individual can be given. Given the software available to industry now, there should be a simplified and centralised system for pharmacists in order that they can say a person has received his or her allocation of a certain medicine.We have to be imaginative and brave and, at times, take on vested interests and those who up to now looked on prescribing as solely within their remit. The legislation is a step in the right direction in the context of reference pricing and generic substitution. We must wait to find out how the Minister will reference prices and what criteria he will use. The key issue is the need for a centralised policy to reduce our drugs bill. I refer, for example, to the obesity issue. Deputy Ó Caoláin, myself and others highlight this regularly at the Joint Committee on Health and Children as we chip away at the issue while organisations appear before us to make presentations. I do not point fingers at any Government but we have not made an effort to deal with this issue and every policy maker knows we are sitting on a time bomb, although the consultant, Dr. Donal O'Shea said we are not sitting on the time bomb because it has gone off. We are facing an obesity epidemic and, unfortunately, if it is not addressed in the early years in the context of diet, quality of life, health and education, the State will be forced to pick up the tab down the road to treat diabetes, cardiac and coronary problems and all that flows from them. This will place a significant burden on the State as it will have to pick up the tab but, more important, on individuals whose quality of life will be badly affected. I am concerned that if the price of medicines is reduced, they could continue to be prescribed at the same rate. There must be a concerted policy to ensure that if prices are reduced, usage does not increase and that there is a response to the needs of our citizens and our society. Obesity will be one of the biggest killers in this country if we follow the trend in the United States and north western Europe. It is happening before our eyes and the statistics are alarming. One in four of our school children is well overweight and borderline obese, which is a disturbing statistic, given obesity does not improve with age. Statistics also highlight that more children are having cardiac and coronary issues because they are overweight and we must be conscious of this. It is fine to reduce the drugs bill but usage could increase because the issues creating the need for them in the first place are not being addressed. I urge the Minister of State to ensure a centralised policy is adopted. We have made strides to addressing the smoking problem but, at the same time, a large cohort of young people are taking up cigarettes, particularly young girls who start to smoke at an early age, which is a disturbing development. We need tough policy responses to address these issues. Subtle messages in advertising by tobacco companies has encouraged people to take up smoking. While I acknowledge there is a ban on tobacco advertising, we must be conscious that these companies avail of the Internet, magazines and so on to advertise and use high profile models who are seen as influential among cohorts of young women. They are used in a subtle way to encourage young people to take up smoking as a diet suppressant to look like Kate Moss, for example. We must get serious about this to make sure we address the issue at an early stage. Many people share the view that we should not reduce the price of medicines without addressing usage. Another key issue is the fact that the pharmaceutical industry is a critical component of the economy. The State attracts the best multinationals but I would be concerned if the reason they located here was that we pay over and beyond what we should for on patent products because I assumed they were here because of the attractive foreign direct investment package we offer. We have a capable, well educated, flexible and committed workforce and the necessary infrastructure with close co-operation between third level institutes and universities and the industry to develop products and so on and the State should not pay excessive amounts for medicines. I hope that is not the case because the last thing we need is for the agreement announced yesterday to jeopardise the pharmaceutical industry. It is inexplicable that this would do so. I hope and believe they locate here for all the other reasons as opposed to the State paying well in excess of what other countries pay for patented drugs. When the legislation is passed and the Minister has put in place the resources to address the issue of price referencing, the Irish Medicines Board will decide the interchangeable drugs. Will the board have sufficient resources? It is key that the staff of the IMB are given all the resources they need in order that they can move swiftly on this issue to make sure the interchangeables are listed. People also need to be educated that generic drugs are not a lesser type of medicine. There are anecdotal stories of people when having drugs prescribed by their doctor saying that because their friend says that the blue tablets are better than the pink tablets, they want them. An advertising campaign needs to be run to tell people to trust the IMB. The board will make the decisions about the interchangeables and it needs to publicise the fact that generics are as good as branded or proprietary drugs. I refer again to reimbursement. The only way a person can remain on the reimbursement list is if a prescription required, which can only be written by a GP. Many people have to pay a GP for this or the State pays him or her indirectly. That is tying up the system. There is a significant opportunity for us to discuss with the IMO, the representative organisations of other medical professionals and policy makers to create a system whereby all the professionals, including doctors and pharmacists work in cohesion. I acknowledge there must be clear lines of demarcation for some drugs but others should be moved from the prescription only list to the over the counter list. It is a slow process and while the IMB has a role, a broader discussion is needed about the role of pharmacists in dispensing low level prescription drugs. The Minister has referred to discussions on an in-between prescription that could be dispensed by pharmacists but it will be difficult to deliver on the issue. This brings us to primary care, which is about delivering care at the lowest level possible in communities. The pharmacist has a role in this regard. The legislation is critical and it is welcome for many reasons. If it is too successful, it could discourage a proactive culture of health promotion and I am concerned about this.

The Government has talked continuously about health care reform and its determination to reform the public health service. Some of us believe reform is, for the most part, a euphemism for cuts and austerity. There is no clearer example of where this is the case than what the Government is doing to home helps and home care packages. It is despicable to cut more than 1 million home help hours to the elderly and the disabled, some of our most vulnerable citizens. One cannot call it reform because it is just cuts. Every one of the hours cut will degrade the quality of life of our most vulnerable citizens. It will mean more suffering, more loneliness and more isolation. For many people, it will mean an accelerated move to death. It is despicable, unacceptable and there is no justification for it. The Government should reverse the cuts. It should find the money elsewhere and leave the elderly and the disabled alone. Given the move to take personal assistants from some of our most disabled citizens, the fact I have heard from parents of some of the most severely disabled children who have had respite hours taken from them, and the cutting of home help hours, I seriously ask what the Government has against the elderly and the disabled. This is not a rhetorical point. The Government seems to be relentlessly targeting them, which is appalling and should stop. I appeal to the Government to reverse the cuts and make it clear that no further cuts will be visited upon this area. I shudder to think what €700 million of further cuts to the health service in the December budget will look like in light of what this has meant for some of our most vulnerable citizens. Apart from the awfulness of the cuts, I question the economic logic behind them. The Government seeks to outsource these services to private companies, replacing not-for-profit home help providers with for-profit home help providers. An woman in her 80s from Greystones phoned me to explain that she is on a waiting list for public home help services. She is paying €26 an hour to a private home help provider. Public home help providers receive between €12 and €14 per hour. Where is the difference going? It is going into the pockets of private companies, like Comfort Keepers. These are the subsidiaries of multinationals and they see the needs of our elderly and disabled citizens as an opportunity to make money. Setting aside ideological differences in the House, it is unacceptable that the support and health care necessary for our elderly, disabled and sick citizens should be dependent on whether someone can make money from it. It does not make sense from the point of view of the public finances. I urge the Government to lay off home help services and I urge it to protect the not-for-profit home help services and the low paid women workers who work in those services and provide community care. The Government should stop the drive to put people on the clock. The Taoiseach denied home help workers were being put on the clock but they are. It is dehumanising and is degrading the service. If the Government does not stop, there will be public outcry. The home helps who came into the Dáil and who were on the streets are not going away. They will fight and continue their campaign. The Government should lay off them and back off on these cuts.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	245	I welcome the opportunity to contribute. I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett in respect of the cuts. It is the worst kind of cutback when home helps are being targeted in this way. The Taoiseach referred to saving only €8 million out of €200 million spent on home help services every year. It means much more to people in their daily lives. Over the past week or two, I have been contacted by a number of elderly people, including a 91 year-old man who will lose the two half hour periods of home help he receives every week. He lives on his own and wants to continue to do so. The service has been withdrawn to save €8 million and to cut 450,000 hours of home help support. A family, in which the mother suffers from Alzheimer's, is struggling to keep her out of a nursing home because they want to keep in her home environment. The HSE has cut the hour provided on a Saturday to help put the mother to bed. These cuts are taking place throughout the country. The HSE dresses it up by saying the same number of people receive a service based on medical need and by saying that 50,000 people receive the service. This is the reality of what such cuts are inflicting on people. I agree with the argument on privatisation, which is coming. We have it in Donegal and every other county. Privatisation is nonsensical and short-sighted in a budgetary sense. Keeping people at home saves money in the long run.

This week, we read that one in ten people in the country cannot feed themselves. Now that the Government has achieved that, it wants to try to get older people to die a little younger so that it can save more money. My father does not want to go into a home. I do not know anyone of that age who wants to go into a home if it can be avoided. These cuts will create a situation where people must go into institutionalised care. One does not need to be a genius to work out that people are better off in their homes. It is difficult to make the argument because I thought the Government agreed with it. I thought the Government agreed because one cannot argue against it. On many subjects, one is told one cannot do it because the country is bankrupt and does not have the money. On this subject, the Government does not have that argument. If these people cannot be taken care of in their homes, it will cost much more to take care of them in a place where they will be less happy. Trying to apply logic to the situation does not work. Why is the Government doing this when it will cost more and make old people miserable? I thought the Government agreed with fairness, but it does not.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	247	The upgrading of the home help service over the past ten years has probably been the most significant development in health services in this country. Home help staff in the 21st century are highly trained, dedicated and proficient in delivering excellent quality of care and assistance to thousands of vulnerable people who wish to live in their homes, their own environment and in the local community. As regards value for money, the cost and benefit ratio is not matched in any other sector in the delivery of health services in this country. Recent developments highlight the expanding role they play into the future, with fewer patients in hospitals, shorter hospital stays and the increasing focus on community care.The total health spend for this year is in the region of €13 billion. The recent decision to reduce funding to the home health service by €8 million for the last quarter of 2012 equates to a loss of approximately 450,000 hours. This is devastating, on top of the half a million hours cut when the HSE service plan was announced. Compared to the €13 billion, this is nitpicking.  This dramatic reduction is an indictment of the reckless policy of the HSE and the Department of Health of targeting the most vulnerable in our society and causing undue hardship and stress to people. I am sure all public representatives are aware of people whose home help service has been totally discontinued, causing them considerable unease, unrest and inconvenience.  Hundreds of people have had their hours seriously cut. Some people report that their hours have been so reduced that their home help can only rush in, stay for 20 minutes and rush out again. These people are now worried that they may lose their home help altogether.  The reduction in home care packages is also causing serious problems.

#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	249	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White. Previous speakers have mentioned the regulation of home care provision. Until recently, the provision of residential care in institutions was not regulated or inspected. It took a scandal, unearthed by "Prime Time Investigates" to establish the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and for minimum standards to be introduced. The Law Reform Commission report, Legal Aspects of Professional Home Care, recommended that HIQA be given additional regulatory and inspection powers to ensure that appropriate legal standards are in place for undertakings providing professional home care, that is, that the State would provide a set of minimum standards, supervised by HIQA, to ensure that private home care providers which are outside the loop of the HSE are doing the right thing. I have mentioned this issue three of four times in the House. I have a personal involvement in the matter. Families who are dependent on home care providers, whether commercial or publicly funded, want to know that someone who is looking after an elderly relative or semi-independent adult, because this issue does not only affect old people, is properly trained and has the necessary skills, that an inspection regime is in place, that there are consequences if things go wrong and that these things can be examined on a renewable and continual basis. That is not the case at present. The Programme for Government 2010-2016 commits the Government, in principle, to introducing legislation for this matter. However, we recently saw another "Prime Time Investigates" exposé of this issue. Given that we will shortly hold a referendum to enshrine the rights of the child in the Constitution for the first time, it is important that we introduce legislation to ensure that people who are in receipt of home care services, whether home help hours or packages provided privately and funded through the HSE, are guaranteed a minimum standard assured by HIQA so that action can be taken, if necessary. Recently, the Minister for Health visited St. Ita's community hospital in my constituency and enunciated the importance of maintaining people in their home environment. This is critical. To achieve this, multidisciplinary services must be provided. The services of a physiotherapist and occupational therapist are essential. The home help is often the person on whom all of this hinges. It is often the home help who makes the telephone call and arranges to have the public health nurse come and change bandages, and so on. The home help is often the last line of defence.  Home helps need legislative protection to ensure that the standard they are working to is enshrined in law and that they have the protection of the law, as professional providers who are entrusted by the community to look after people. I quote from the Law Reform Commission report of 30 June 2012, to which I referred earlier. It states:The main beneficiaries of the proposed new HIQA regulation will be those over 65. The proposed system should apply to professional home care provided to any adult over 18 in their own home. There should be a specific register of professional home carers which would set out the specific requirements in relation to the registration and monitoring of professional home carers. In 2012, it is not too much to ask that a service provided and funded by the State would be covered by regulation. I implore the Minister of State, as a matter of urgency, to bring such legislation forward.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	250	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. The prospect of change is always worrying, especially when it concerns one's health. The fair deal package is now widely accepted as a good deal for many people. I know many people who are using it. After initial worries, people are now largely happy with it.  We need to look at the issue of financing home care. Perhaps we should consider a system along the lines of the fair deal scheme. Instead of considering a person's assets over a period of three years they could be assessed over 15 years. This would allow a contribution to the State as well as a recognition that a person needs and gets the best home care possible. Farmers had an issue with the fair deal scheme because, as well as the primary residence the farm asset was also taken into consideration. This was a little unfair but it is something that can be looked at down the road. We need innovative solutions for funding the measures we need. We are all against cuts in services, but where can savings be made? We need to assist the people who deserve our care the most.  The parents of disabled children are worried by the prospect of changes in services. We need to consider these children on a whole-of-life basis. We need a plan for these children, from birth to the very end, to take the worry from their parents. We cannot have a system where children are managed for a few years but there is nothing for them later on. Organisations such as the Cope Foundation in Mallow and St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville are remarkable. We must help these organisations because they are doing an extraordinary job. Ordinary people who are living ordinary lives are dealing with situations that are incredibly taxing with an extraordinary attitude. One would not realise what they are dealing with because they get on with life. It is important that we recognise these people and help them as best we can.  We must not forget the people who are out of work.They have many skills and can, perhaps, retrain in the area of home care. JobBridge and other such schemes might be handy in this regard as well. In addition, we must try to encourage people in communities once again to visit their elderly neighbours, even if it is just to call in and ask if there is anything they can do for them. Over the last number of years people were so busy and consumed with all that was happening they forgot to spend a little time looking after their neighbourhood. Thankfully, rural areas are getting better again in this regard. We must examine how we can fund home care and care for the most vulnerable. We must consider a whole of life approach for those who are most vulnerable. How we manage to do that will define us as a Government.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	The opening statement in the Private Members' motion refers to the rights of older people to live in dignity and independence and to age well in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. That is something all of us endorse. This year, 2012, is the European year for active ageing and solidarity between generations. Together with other member states, the Government has celebrated and promoted positive and active ageing. Currently, Ireland has just above 500,000 people aged 65 years or older, but by 2021 that number is expected to be approximately 775,000. That is an increase of 55% in just 11 years. However, Ireland is one of only two countries of the 34 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, that have dedicated Ministers to support policy decisions relating to older people's issues. When this Government took office the fine Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was given that ministerial responsibility. This Government is committed to bringing greater coherence to Government planning, policy and service delivery for older people. We are at a very important juncture in terms of future policies and services for older people. Currently, we have the lowest proportion of population aged 65 years and older in the EU, but this will change and now is the time to get our house in order. The expected demographic changes will bring significant challenges but also great opportunities. These challenges can be met successfully and the opportunities fully exploited by planning ahead now, just as we must plan for any change. The national positive ageing strategy is being developed within the constraints posed by the current fiscal situation. It sets out the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people. It sets out to establish a common framework for the development of operational plans by Departments and to clarify their objectives relating to older people. It will also involve the development of ongoing mechanisms designed to monitor progress and to identify challenges facing older people in future. A key objective of Government policy has been to support older people to live at home in their communities for as long as possible. This option, the preferred choice of most older people, has been maximised through enhancing the range of HSE services such as home help, home care packages and day and respite care. In addition, the Department, in consultation with the HSE, is currently preparing proposals to ensure that access to community services is provided on a nationally consistent and equitable basis having regard to each person's care needs and means. The purpose of the national positive ageing strategy is to identify the provisions that must be made and the plans that must be implemented to ensure the best quality of life for older people in Ireland in the future. In that context, a key objective of the new strategy is to help people develop and maintain a positive quality of life as they grow older by encouraging people of all ages to think positively about their own ageing, to plan sensibly for their later years and to facilitate them in adopting the type of lifestyle practices that will have the effect of adding years to their life and life to their years. This means we must maintain, develop and enhance home care front-line services, ensuring older people are facilitated to remain at home. The majority of older people continue to live in the community well into later life. The housing grant for older people administered by local councils has been very effective in improving the standards of living for older people in Ireland. It must continue and be supported. This Government has given a commitment that anybody who has been assessed as having a service need will have that service provided. The Minister, Deputy James Reilly, recently urged us to use the "get smart" approach. Given that most people wish to remain at home, let us nurture and encourage all of those community services that currently exist. The continuation of home care packages enables a tailored approach to the needs of older people. These home care packages differ from the normal care in the community in that they allow for the provision of enhanced services beyond the normal levels available in a community and can prevent or delay admission to acute hospitals or long-term care. There are, of course, additional supports available in communities, such as meals on wheels, which I run in two towns in my constituency. Many day and respite care places are offered by wonderful voluntary organisations. Last week I had the pleasure of meeting the Support 4 Older People organisation in Drogheda. It offers a wide range of services and is not financed by the State. We do not give people in the voluntary sector enough credit. An increase in life expectancy is a product of successful health, economic and social policies. Increasing numbers of old people are an indicator of the successes achieved in that society. Rather than portraying ageing of the population in a negative light, Ireland should develop a strategic framework for the co-ordination of policy reforms to meet the challenges we face. We must ensure that we do not use the fiscal crisis to bring us down, but use it as an overarching strategy to point to the destination at which we wish to arrive. What can be done now, given that we are all agreed that this is where we are heading? Let us be ambitious and work towards making Ireland the best place in which to grow old.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	252	In speaking on this motion, it is most important to highlight the fact that our goal is for people, where possible, to grow old in their own homes, surrounded by their families, neighbours and friends in an area in which they have generally lived for most of their lives. The benefits of this are obvious. There is the quality of life benefits for the older person and also the quality of life benefits for their family and those around them. Within my extended circle of friends, families and constituents I see situations where the son and his wife or the daughter and her husband are working during the day but trying to be around to help their parents as much as possible. They give up a huge amount of their free time to help and support them. They just need a little extra support to help their parents in that situation to remain living at home. The State has a crucial role to play in ensuring that nobody goes into long-term care unless they really need to or want it. In the past, that has not always been the case. The issue is how we ensure that model is rolled out into the future. The fair deal was mentioned earlier. There should be a revised fair deal model to provide for the possibility of a funding mechanism for people to have a home care package. I have encountered cases in the past where people, if they had access to long-term care, were able to use the fair deal. Such a mechanism was more difficult for home care. I must stress that any mechanism in that situation would have to be cognisant of how much cheaper it is to provide the services in the home. If somebody is in their home rather than a nursing home, they will need physiotherapy, home help, the services of the district nurse and whatever else is required. However, there is no cost of heating, electricity and so forth in a nursing home, while the cost of bed and board is borne by the person who remains in their home. It is a completely different funding model, with a much smaller contribution. Nonetheless, a model that assists that outcome is very important and should be rolled out. I would support it in the right circumstances and with the right conditions. During my time as a councillor in Kildare County Council and as a Member of this House I have seen the massive benefit of housing adaptation grants for older people and people with disabilities. They play an integral part in an overall strategy of enabling older people to remain in their homes. Those grants are currently suspended by Kildare County Council, as is the case with other local authorities. I have lobbied the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, heavily on this issue and I urge the Minister of State who is present, Deputy Alex White, to look at the current model, given the financial difficulties of our local authorities. They are struggling to meet the 20% contribution. I implore the Minister to convey to his colleagues the necessity to reduce that contribution from 20% to 10%. In the case of my local authority, if that cut was made to the local authority contribution, it would get those grants moving again.Over and beyond the positive impact that has in enabling people to remain in their homes, it also has a positive impact on the local economy, with local tradesmen getting that work. The money feeds right in. With reform of local government and a property tax being collected locally to pay for local services, local authorities will be able to prioritise expenditure. The current model, however, must be examined to enable local authorities to do what they can. I welcome the national carers strategy that seeks to prioritise funding for accessible living environments, and this is in line with that. The positive ageing strategy was run on a trial basis in Louth and then was rolled out in Kildare. The positive experience we have had with that in Kildare will be relayed to the Minister. He is to bring a draft plan to Cabinet before the end of the year on the rolling out of that scheme nationally. We need a strategic and co-ordinated approach on the well-being of older people. I recognise that people who are now retired and in need of care are the same people who were working and raising families in the early 1980s when Charlie Haughey told them to tighten their belts. Having made all the sacrifices back then, they are now in the autumn of their years and it is vital we give them the care and respect they are due. I am delighted this Government is doing that with €320 million being invested in home care packages.

Like many Members, we are not happy with the cuts to home help and care packages for the most vulnerable. The health service, however, is difficult to manage properly. There is no shortage of critical issues in health. These critical issues are constantly competing to become the most urgent issue for the Government of the day. If we look through the health service,s we are starting to see huge structural defects across the administration and set-up of the health services. We are trying to address those issues against a background of massive budgetary adjustments at the same time. Tonight we are talking about carers and home care packages, but there are other significant issues in health at this time that are just as urgent and considered just as critical by the people involved. There has been a major shift in the mental health services from inpatient care to community care, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is dealing with it carefully and sympathetically because it requires a new mindset on how to manage patients with serious mental illness. That should be acknowledged, as should the Minister of State's work. We must also reduce waiting times for patients. For the first time in my career, and I have been involved in health for 25 years, I know how long my patients must wait for an outpatient appointment. This was information we did not have before and we must reduce those times as quickly as possible, but it requires a massive change in how the hospitals are managed and how doctors, nurses and physiotherapists do their jobs. There is no idea what we must overcome to get that right in order that we can see patients quickly. We are now working on reducing the costs of drugs because they were out of kilter with what we should have been paying, and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, has been given the responsibility of getting primary care to work better. This is an area with which I was involved before I joined politics, and I am still involved with it now. I have seen significant changes in general practice, even since I came in. Some of the drugs we were using to treat patients when I first qualified as a GP are considered obsolete. The treatments for patients are completely different from those I was trained to administer as a junior doctor. There has been an explosion in the use of IT within primary care. The ways we manage out of hours, the paramedics and ambulances have all changed. We are constantly working with the HSE and the medical colleges to make those changes happen. I am enthusiastic about how change will work in primary care and how doctors, physiotherapists, social workers and home care teams will all work together for patients. We are so good at being cynical and hypocritical in this Chamber about this topic that we need to be more positive and say what is working well. There are problems, but many of them are from the background of wasting money in the health service and many of these reforms were highlighted when we were in opposition. We highlighted the changes that must come about and they are now coming about because we have a Government that is focused on making change. If I was to make any criticism, it would be that we should do it even faster. These reforms will work and will deliver better health services. I have listened to so many Members on the Opposition benches opposing change and I have watched over the years when people opposed the cancer strategy and major operations in small expert centres. In spite of what is happening in Roscommon, Deputy Flanagan might one day acknowledge that the changes might be good for the people of Roscommon. Perhaps, however, he dug himself into a corner and cannot acknowledge it. I have seen the changes happen in recent years and I have seen things getting better for patients.

Sinn Féin enjoys the benefit of getting £4 billion from Her Majesty's Government to lessen the impacts the cutbacks are having on the health service in Northern Ireland. North of the Border, Sinn Féin is doing it while south of the Border, we are doing it. We are trying to work to the best of our ability to deliver the best possible health services.

Home help services and packages are a lifeline to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. This year, 10.7 million hours of home help support will be provided in communities from Louth to Limerick and Donegal to Dingle. This compares favourably with the number of hours allocated in 2006 at the height of the boom. My admiration and respect for the critical work done by those who care for older people and those with various needs in the community is beyond measure. We often forget about those who deliver the services on the ground day in and day out. The home help services are the Cinderella of the Irish health system. The work of the home helps has never been formally recognised by the HSE. It is effectively undervalued and ignored. The heroes and heroines of the service, the home helps themselves, have been disrespected and devalued by the HSE since 2007. They have no basic contract or agreed hours. In essence, those who are engaged by the HSE do not enjoy the protections and supports provided to those HSE staff governed by the Croke Park agreement. It is high time this wrong was put right by the HSE and that there was meaningful engagement to deal with those issues. Turning to the content of the motion, it is said a person can only be called a hypocrite if he judges others first. There is no shortage of inhabitants of the high moral ground among the Members opposite. They are always ready to judge the actions of others, but the Members opposite do not come to this debate with clean hands. Sinn Féin's record of government in the North is pockmarked with hypocrisy and failure when it comes to health and social services.

Is the party tabling the motion tonight the same party that is closing 70 schools in Northern Ireland, only a matter of miles from my constituency where we are building a considerable number of schools and extending even more? By slashing spending in the North to the tune of €5 billion, as it is preparing to do on the one hand, while keeping a straight face when opposing any adjustments at all in the South, Sinn Féin is taking the Irish people, North and South, for something of a ride. There is a credibility problem Sinn Féin must address, but it will not because it cannot. The motion states the party wants to reduce pressure on acute hospital services when members of Deputy Adams's organisation in my constituency have apparently spent thousands of euros in recent weeks publicly thanking me for doing just that by securing a 30 bed step-down unit in the cottage hospital in Drogheda to take pressure from a hospital Deputy Adams could not identify on a map less than a year ago.Where issues arise around the prioritisation of funding for home care support, I can say with confidence that we can and will address them. Unfortunately the Members opposite who tabled the motion will continue to find it impossible in the next few years to reconcile their words in the Chamber with their actions in the North.

B'fhéidir gur cheart do chuid de na daoine anseo é a cheannach chun an difríocht idir an taobh seo den Teorainn agus an taobh eile a fháil amach. D'fhreastal mé ar chruinniú de chuid Third Age i gCnoc an Línsigh i gContae na Mí an Luan seo caite. D'éist mé le scéalta ó dhaoine aosta mar gheall ar na ciorruithe uafásacha ar an seirbhís chúnamh baile. Chuala mé scéal amháin ó bhean a úsáideann cathaoir rothaí. Bhí seacht n-uaire á fháil aici gach seachtain, ach tá ciorrú d'uair amháin sa tseachtain á dhéanamh ar an seirbhís sin. Tá ciorrú eile á dhéanamh ar bhean eile a fhaigheann 30 nóiméad de chúnamh baile - déantar a dinnéar di - gach tráthnóna. Dúirt cúntóir baile liom go bhfuil an méid ama a chaithfidh siad a thabhairt dá gcliaint níos mó ná an méid ama as a n-íoctar iad. Ní leor leathuair a thabhairt d'fhear nó do bhean má tá éileamh i bhfad níos mó ag an duine sin. Is gá dóibh níos mó ama a thabhairt dár n-othair, ach ní fhaigheann siad níos mó pá le haghaidh an ama sin. Tá cuid den seirbhís seo á soláthar saor in aisce ag a lán cúntóirí baile faoi láthair. De bharr a gcuid daonnachta, ní féidir leo imeacht gan chúnamh ceart a thabhairt dá gcliaint. Is cleachtadh coitianta é seo. Tá an córas ag déanamh mí-úsáide as daonnacht na n-oibrithe. Tá an Rialtas ag goid seirbhísí i gceann de na hearnálacha is leochailí sa tír. Is polasaí leithleasach é seo. Ní cheart dúinn déileáil le daoine atá tar éis saol fada oibre a chur isteach - a íoc cáin, a thóg glúin nua agus a mhair dhá nó trí cúluithe eacnamaíochta eile - sa chaoi seo. Tá Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, atá bródúil as a thaifead ar chearta na n-oibrithe, mar dhea, ag mí-úsáid na ndaoine a thugann cúnamh don dream sin. De ghnáth i gcúrsaí polaitiúla, ní bhíonn an mhoráltacht agus an t-airgeadas ar an taobh céanna - bíonn saghas coimhlint eatarthu. Ar an ábhar seo, tá siad ceangailte le chéile. Nuair a laghdaíonn an Rialtas an córás chúnamh baile, is ionann sin agus daoine aosta a bhrú isteach sa chóras sláinte, lena mbaineann costais i bhfad níos mó. Is polasaí craiceáilte é seo. Laghdaíonn sé sláinte an duine agus mianach an tsaoil agus cosnaíonn sé níos mó. Nuair a bhí mé ag smaoineamh inné mar gheall ar chumas an dream a fhaigheann an tseirbhís chúnamh baile, thuig mé nach mbeadh an cuid is mó dóibh in ann teacht go dtí geataí Teach Laighin amárach chun a gcuid tuairimí a chur in iúl mar pháirt den bhfeachtas ar an ábhar seo. Níl sé ar a gcumas ag na daoine is laige sa tír é sin a dhéanamh. Ta sé dochreidte go bhfuil an Rialtas ag piocadh orthu. Tá rogha ollmhór ag an Rialtas - bí cinnte faoi sin. Tá deacrachtaí acu, ach is féidir leo an t-airgead seo a fháil in áiteanna eile. Tá siad ag laghdú an méid uair chúnamh baile a fhaigheann na daoine is laige sa tír, ach fós ag tabhairt airgid do na sealbhóirí bannaí. Níl seans ar bith go n-ardóidh an Rialtas seo an ráta cánach a íocann iad siúd a thuileann níos mó ná €100,000. Cad faoi cháin rachmais? God, no. Ní dóigh liom go dtabharfaidh an Lucht Oibre cáin rachmais isteach fad is atá an dream is laige fós sa tír. Impím go díreach ar Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre a meon ar an ábhar seo a athrú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún. Iarraim orthu siúd a fhaigheann cúnamh baile breathnú go géar ar na Teachtaí a vótálann in aghaidh an rúin seo agus na Teachtaí a vótálann ina choinne. Ní cheart dóibh dearmad a dhéanamh ar an méid a tharlóidh nuair a dhéanann an Dáil vótáil.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	The programme for Government states that the Government is the first in the history of the State that is committed to developing a universal single-tier health service which guarantees access to medical care based on need and not income. It goes on to state that investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority. There is nothing in that vision for health care with which we would disagree. Health care and care for the elderly has become a nightmare for the people we represent. This should not be seen as a factional issue, it is one that affects people across the board. Nowhere is this more real than in the treatment of home helps and the people they serve. Home helps, home care providers and carers provide an essential service to those who want to live independently at home and in their community. The HSE home helps are the success story of home care for the elderly and community care. They are an efficient and reliable front line service, costing between €12 and €15 per hour while the private agencies cost between €20 and €23 per hour. The Minister has taken an axe in the name of cost cutting and balancing budgets and cut the number of HSE home helps to 9,380 and has continued, like his predecessors, to cut front line services. In the past five years 2 million hours have been cut. Some home helps have had their hours cut to single digits while some are expected to go from one house to another and spend just 15 or 30 minutes there. Those who had two hours home help get one hour, those who had one hour home help get half an hour while those who had half an hour home help get 15 minutes. The service has been cut to the bone.  I have spoken to many home help workers who have come to see me about it. Home helps are being forced to cut corners or work free, which they should not be expected to do and they work over and above the call of duty. In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, the reduction in the numbers employed as home helps and carers is startling. In the past 12 months, the HSE has lost 60 home help staff and reduced the number of hours for remaining staff while at the same time there has been a direct increase in private agency staff which, I understand, is more expensive. Having discussed the issue with elderly people I am informed that the service is not as good. The Labour Party needs to address the issue. I am not trying to score political points but I am making the point that the Minister is privatising and outsourcing the service. This means home helps have fewer rights and worse conditions and the elderly are not getting as good a service while the taxpayers are not getting a bang for their buck. This completely contradicts the commitment in the programme for Government to finance community and long-term care which supports older people to stay in their homes. The Government is tripping itself up over broken promises. Some 95% of people over 65 years of age live independently in their own homes and the State must provide the small amount of services they need to continue living into old age with dignity. The Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has cut back on the home help service. The reduced funding is making it impossible for people to stay in their own homes. Meanwhile the Government is threatening to close nursing homes, particularly those in Shean and Abbeyleix. On the one hand there is a threat to close nursing homes and some have already been closed.On the other hand, this service is being cut back. Some people who should be living at home with a small amount of assistance have not been getting it. They are then forced into nursing home care - in some cases the HSE is putting them into private nursing homes which needs subvention. The health plan as it operates in Laois and Offaly is in tatters and I am sure it is the same in the other 24 counties. I urge Deputies, particularly Labour Party and Independent Deputies to vote in favour of the motion. We should be judged on how we look after the most vulnerable in our society. The most vulnerable people in our society are older people who depend on us and depend on their home helps to do that bit of work for them in the morning, to get them out of bed, get them ready for the day and look after them. As this is how we will be judged, I am asking Deputies to vote in favour of our motion and to support home helps and support our elderly.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	The purpose of the motion is to request Deputies of all parties to do the right thing by reversing the most recent and previous cutbacks in the home care services, which affect the most dependent people in our communities, those who cannot live independent lives in their own homes without societal support. It is difficult to say everything I want to say about this in five minutes. I want to talk about the things that people are saying to me. I want to talk about things like humanity, respect, decency and social obligations. I want to talk about the legal framework and particularly the distinction between discretionary and mandatory services. I want to talk about stated Government policy as opposed to ideology and practice. I want to talk about consequences for people, for their families, for health professionals and not least for politicians. When I talk to people about cutbacks in home help services I am talking about elderly people living alone in isolated rural areas who cannot rest, wash, set the fire or cook for themselves. They are being told that their home help is being cut from one hour five days a week to 30 minutes three days a week, following a so-called assessment. I have spoken to parents of severely autistic children after they have been informed by the State that their child is not sufficiently disabled to merit the carer's allowance or a respite care. I have spoken to family members who have seen home help reduced or withdrawn from their elderly dependent relatives. I have also seen reductions in day-centre services, transport services, voluntary organisation funding and carer's allowance - if the family is lucky enough to qualify for half rate carer's allowance. Owing to the decisions made by this and the previous Government, it is now the case that not even the postman calls to elderly people living in isolated rural areas. What about aspects such as humanity, respect, decency and social obligation? Irish people are very good at looking after their dependent family members. Most Irish people will only place dependent relatives, whether they are children, parents or grandparents, into residential care when they can no longer maintain them at home. If civilised people in Irish society could speak with one voice, that voice would say, "Reverse these cutbacks". We, as a Parliament working on behalf of society, should do everything in our collective power to help people to do the right thing. Instead of that we are withdrawing the meagre supports available to help people to do the right thing. Do we do this because home help and home care services are not legally mandatory services? Is this why they are always first to be cut? Is it because those who receive and also provide home care are not an effective political lobby? Is it because the real unstated agenda is to privatise all home care support services? The Government claims it wants to keep people living in their own homes for as long as possible. It claims to be developing primary and community services in order to reduce demand on acute hospitals and on residential care. It also claims the best place for people to be is in their homes as long as they can stay there. This makes humanitarian, social and economic sense. Deputy Nash spoke about hypocrisy. The real hypocrisy will be when he presses the button to vote tonight. It is hypocrisy to have these stated intentions and then make home help and home care services a privilege rather than right. These cutbacks will mean more people in residential care and will mean people spending longer than is medically necessary in our overcrowded acute hospitals. The cutbacks will regrettably but inevitably result in elderly vulnerable people prematurely dying alone. They will result in carers and home helps reaching and passing breaking point. They will result in local public health nurses, who provide an invaluable caring role within the community, being regarded as agents for HSE cuts and they will result in more money going into the pockets of for-profit health care providers. Deputies from the Government parties must know this.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	267	I begin by commending the thousands of home helps throughout the State, mostly women, who are the essential support for many of our older citizens. Many home helps spend much longer with their clients than the minimum amount dictated by the HSE - and they certainly do not do it for money. Home helps are paid €14 per hour. They have very poor terms and no legal protections. The cost of providing this service through the private sector is €23 per hour and the taxpayer picks up that tab. I welcome the home helps and their representatives who came here this evening. I believe they represent the true spirit of community and volunteerism because without their very unselfish efforts many of our most vulnerable citizens would fall through the cracks of a system that is deeply flawed. Home helps allow citizens to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and in their own communities. They form a crucial part of a community-based health care system that helps to prevent many citizens unnecessarily spending days, weeks or months in hospital beds. They are mostly women. Women are compassionate and have the sense that perhaps the male gender does not have. They see the need and they meet it. Often it is an older citizen living alone, in isolation, frail, helpless and lonely. Sometimes it is a couple who have been together for decades. They do not want to be separated and need a home help to avoid having to go into a nursing home. In many cases the home help is the only social contact these folk have. They walk into homes where older citizens are unable to dress, feed themselves, light fires for heating, wash or clean up. They are being told they have to do this in 15 minutes or half an hour. They include citizens such as an 80-year-old partly sighted woman from outside Drogheda who was released from hospital recently after a hip replacement. She has limited mobility and cannot light her fire. Yet she was allocated half an hour of home-help service a week. Shame on the Minister - it is a disgrace. The Government and the Members opposite appear immune to all of this. Since I came here I have tried to figure this out. Government Members live in these communities and these are their family members and friends. I have still not figured it out. They praise the work of home helps and claim to understand the needs of older citizens, yet they take decisions and support policies, including the Government's amendment to this motion, that devalue the role of home helps, cut back those services, and expose vulnerable citizens to harm. They extol the virtues of care in the community and the work of home helps, yet they strip away the resources needed to make them work. They express concern at the number of older citizens in hospital beds, who should be discharged while they implement policies that stop home care packages and keep older citizens in hospital at greater financial cost. They bemoan the absence of compassion while pursuing a policy of privatisation and profit.That is the nub of it. The Minister cannot with credibility manage the public nursing home sector while benefiting from the privatisation of nursing home provision and refusing to publicise the criteria by which the Government determines where primary health care centres should be sited. There are cultures and societies in the world which genuinely care and venerate their older citizens and ancestors. I am firmly of the view that the majority of Irish people share this opinion. This cannot, however, be said of the Government parties. The decision to close 14 long-stay residential care beds and 15 respite beds in the cottage hospital in my constituency is one example of this. The facts are clear: almost one million home help hours will be lost. For the benefit of Deputy Nash, this means that some of the 1,184 citizens in County Louth currently in receipt of home support will lose that support. That is totally unacceptable. It is a sign of the Labour Party's embarrassment on this issue that only one member of that party is in the House for this debate. I ask all Deputies to support this motion. Anything else is an abdication of our responsibility as Deputies.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-10-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	268	I have listened to what people on all sides of the debate have had to say. It is useful to recap at this juncture on what we are agreed on. We are all agreed that it is better for older people to live and be cared for at home. There is a unanimous view across the House on this matter. We know that aside from the social desirability and the dignity concerns of people living and being cared for at home, this adds up economically. We are, I believe, also agreed on that. The Carers' Association, the voluntary organisation for carers throughout the country, was in Leinster House today on a lobbying exercise because it, like others, is fearful of what might come in December's budget. The association usefully set out in tabular format, in euro and cent, why it makes cost savings sense to care for people in their own homes. They have that argument won, game, set and match. I believe we all subscribe to that view, which is what makes the Minister's position on this matter all the more astonishing. Unlike others, a year and a half into the term of office of this Government, I am not very surprised that the Minister would try again to hit at those he deems to be vulnerable. I am not surprised that Deputies from across the Labour and Fine Gael parties are now so craven that they will come into this Chamber and defend what they know to be indefensible and try to point to a distraction and run for cover. None of that surprises me. That is the Government's form. What does astonish me, when something is not just self-evidently right and equitable but also cost effective, is that this Government, which obsesses on the need for adjustments, fiscal responsibility and good housekeeping, would turn its face from the evidence which tells it the smart and economic thing to do is to ensure people are cared for at home. This is not what the Government wants to do. There has been a 20% cut in home help hours since 2008. Precisely half of those cuts have been and will be made under the watch of the current Minister. Between February 2011 to the end of this year, there will have been a drop of one million hours from the system. The Government should not rewind the tape and say this is all the fault of Fianna Fáil. This is the choice of the Fine Gael and Labour parties. They are choosing to impose these cuts. The drop in the number of hours has and will continue to have further real consequences for people. Deputy Adams gave one example, namely, an elderly woman returning home after a hip replacement with mobility issues to be insulted with the offer of half an hour's home help. I do not know whether the Minister has experience of getting a child ready for school, bathing a child or caring for an older person. One will not get a whole lot done within half an hour for an elderly person who is in any way compromised. One will do even less for that person if his or her allocation is as low as 15 minutes. One of my constituents, who has complex health needs and a complex medical history, was allocated 15 minutes home help. That is the time allowed to the carer for this person to be taken from bed and bathed. Those tasks will not be done in 15 minutes. The real cynicism of this approach is that the Minister knows that carers and home help staff epitomise the decency of community and voluntary effort and public service. He is counting on the probability that while only 15 minutes is officially allocated and paid for, the decent carer will remain on and see the person right. The Minister is gambling on that decency, which makes his cynicism all the more disgusting to me. The Government amendment to the motion is curious and revealing in terms of its being full of self-congratulation, welcoming all and sundry and giving itself a great pat on the back. Perhaps the Minister will answer this question. What has he to be proud of in terms of the removal of €8 million worth of home help hours from the system, leaving older, vulnerable and, in many cases, sick people in such jeopardy? Why would anyone with a grain of decency or sanity welcome that? During the course of this debate, one of the Minister's colleagues, a member of the Fine Gael Party, chided members of Sinn Féin for their emotion. He ran the predictable line around identifying sources of funding. The Deputy knows full well that we accept that services must be funded. He also knows full well that this year, like every other year, Sinn Féin will put forward its proposals on that score. The Deputy concerned stated in the course of his contribution that everyone is against cuts. Is that really the case? Is everyone in this House against cuts to home help hours? Was the Deputy speaking for Fine Gael? Is that party against cuts to home help hours? If that was a statement of fact, the Government would not have tabled an amendment to this motion and every Deputy would do right by carers, home help staff and the elderly by supporting the Sinn Féin motion. Often when criticisms are made of policy decisions, adjustments and cutbacks, the Government's cover is that the quantum of savings is so great it has no option but to face into what it deems to be a tough choice for it. This mean-minded, indecent cut to home help will save just €8 million. In the grander scheme of the health budget, that is loose change. I do not know how, taking account of value for money and the real needs of citizens in their homes, the Minister can, with any credibility, argue for or proceed with these cuts.He was forced by people with disabilities to back down from his proposal to take personal assistants from them. He should, if he has any semblance of decency, voluntarily retreat from these cuts in respect of home helps. He will sow the seeds of his own disaster if he proceeds with this cut. The acute hospitals are over-budget and under strain on his watch, and he knows this. He is averse to public nursing home beds and he certainly has closed enough of them. The next line of attack is in respect of home helps. A cut like this will mean greater illness and vulnerability among older people. It will mean more of them will need more expensive medical intervention, more of them will be in hospital and, sadly, given the current state of the service, it will mean more of our elderly citizens will be on hospital trolleys.

No one disputes the fact that high quality home care makes a big difference to older people and their families. There is no doubt the work to date of all those involved in the development and implementation of policy and the provision of services has contributed positively to the lives of those who receive these services. It is also a vital element in meeting the preferred wishes of older people and people with disabilities and their families to stay in their homes where at all possible. It also helps in tackling wider health and social system pressures and addressing poverty in many cases. With the growing demand for such services, there will be challenges ahead as services evolve to meet the needs of older people and, as far as possible, care for them in their own homes and communities. Services will have to adapt and be more flexible in their use of funding while maintaining at their core the person-centred approach. Let me be clear. The Government is committed to a single tier publicly funded health system. This is why the Government is committed to universal health insurance. It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the not-for-profit and private sectors to augment its valuable services to people who need home care at local level where, for whatever reason, the HSE is not in a position to do so itself. This may include where there are resource limitations locally or to ensure care in the evenings and at weekends. Among recent HSE initiatives to improve service nationally has been the introduction of a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. Each local health office, and the clients it serves, now has a choice of four approved providers for new home care packages to supplement its own provision. While these developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for providers and care recipients alike. I must signal clearly that I make no apologies for seeking to maximise the amount of home care we can afford with what is, after all, a substantial budget. I am seeking new models of working in the public sector to achieve efficiencies and seeking to provide a choice of provider where this is possible. This must include partnership arrangements for the voluntary and private sector. Key services realise this objective while also relieving pressures on acute hospitals and long-term care residential systems. The range of community-based services include home care, meals on wheels, and day and respite care. In 2012 we will spend approximately €320 million on home help and home care packages. Approximately 50,000 people receive mainstream home help and, at any one time, approximately 11,000 people receive home care packages. I must ask Deputy Adams whether it is true that Sinn Féin in government in Northern Ireland is closing long-stay beds.

All developments can only be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures. Any decisions taken by the HSE can only reflect the most realistic options which have been designed to minimise front-line impact. The HSE will continue to review how existing funding might best be allocated to ensure maximum service provision. I remind the House that my guiding principle is to treat the patient at the lowest level of complexity which is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible, and nowhere is closer to home than the home itself. I acknowledge and salute the invaluable work done by home helps in helping us achieve this goal, that people, older people in particular, remain in their homes for as long as possible with all that means for their well-being. I commend the Government amendment to the House.

It is a bit rich for him as Minister for Health to come to this House and state this is his guiding policy while at the same time overseeing the removal of 1 million hours of home care support from these very vulnerable people. It is an appalling decision by the Government and the parties which will support the decision. People throughout the country are angry at the decisions the Minister is implementing in the Department of Health. I hope that in my county on Friday we will see thousands of people taking to the streets to protest against the cuts to home help hours. The march will leave St. Conal's Hospital in Letterkenny and go to Market Square. I am sure there will be people from all walks of life, including those who support other political parties and no political parties. What will unite everyone is the fact we are opposed to the appalling decision by the Government to cut home help hours. My colleagues have outlined the facts, but they cannot be overstated. A total of €8 million is to be cut from the home help budget between now and the end of the year. An additional €1.7 million will be cut from home care packages. In total 450,000 hours of vital care and support for many of our community's most vulnerable people will be taken away. In my county of Donegal, we have seen brutal and savage cuts to home help packages for our sick and elderly in recent years. We have seen home help supports taken from vulnerable people in the county. These cuts were implemented not only by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, they were in the main implemented by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party Government. Many people I know listening at home in Donegal will be surprised at the crocodile tears shed by the Fianna Fáil Deputies during the debate, when they remember that in 2010, in one year in just the one county of Donegal, the Fianna Fáil Government cut 99,595 hours of home help support. It is a bit rich for Deputy Micheál Martin to come into this House crying about something we all know he would do if he had the chance to sit on the Government side of the House. From speaking to those on the front line providing support, I know that, as Deputy McDonald said, many of them do not go to a home for 15 minutes or half an hour. They stay on to help the individual through the day to ensure their needs are met.This is because they are people who are passionate about giving the support and care needed by people in their communities. They are people who live up to the rhetoric, not the type of spiel we have heard from the Minister about his aim and ambitions to do this, that and the other. These people are doing it, many times without pay from the Department because the Government has cut their hours.  The plan to cut home help hours by 450,000 hours is cruel and heartless. This will mean a further loss of 20,000 home help hours between now and the end of the year for people in my county. That is almost 2,000 hours per week. It is on top of the 25,000 hours that have been taken away from that county so far this year. It is not feasible to expect a basic level of service will be provided at this level.

However, behind every one of those figures is an individual with a particular need for care. Many of these individuals have been in receipt of home help support for many years. As the HSE on the Government's instruction has decided to cut more hours, they have been assessed time and again and it has been clear that there is a need for them to have the hours they have been allocated. I have sat with them by the fireside and looked them in the face and they have told me they cannot cope with the reduction in hours. Yet the Minister is coming again to strip away the last few hours they have left. What the Minister is doing is cruel and heartless. The Minister and Government Deputies say they have no option but I will give the Minister an option. He says he wants to save €8 million by cutting 450,000 hours of home help supports for very vulnerable people. I would tell him to dig into his pockets. There are 226 Members in this House and the Seanad. We could reduce Ministers' pay to €100,000, Deputies' pay to €75,000 and Senators' pay to €60,000. That leaves every single one of us with a very generous income and would save €4.3 million - over 250,000 home help hours. Politics is all about choices. I would rather stand up here and ask for my pay and that of Senators to be cut instead of taking away that basic need of vulnerable people to stay in their homes so they can live their lives to the fullest. That is the choice the Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies will be asked to make tonight. I believe they will take the wrong position because it is nothing more than cowardly behaviour to attack the most vulnerable people in our society. I listened to Deputy O'Brien last night recount his own experiences and he is not alone. There are thousands more who have different stories and the Government decides to target them. There are other people whose pockets we can dig into. They are sitting beside the Minister and we can alleviate the burden of the cuts he is planning to introduce.

Let me say at the outset that Sinn Féin is absolutely opposed to any cuts in home care packages or home help hours. Essentially, there are two key aspects of this debate. One is the care of vulnerable people and the other is the underemployment of working class women. With regard to the issue of care, Sinn Féin is of the view that the State should recognise the right of people to live with dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible. With regard to the issue of underemployment, home helps employed by the HSE are public service employees. Thus the State has an obligation under the terms of the Croke Park agreement not to impose compulsory redundancies or reduce their rates of pay. Unfortunately, care in the community and the provision of sufficient and decent working hours are outside of and beyond the political imagination of the current Fine Gael-Labour Government. In the neoliberal worldview, which both parties have fully internalised, there is no room for a politics grounded in a sense of fairness, compassion, humanity or social solidarity. Rather, what we have instead is a Government that is prepared to engage in slash and burn-type politics irrespective of the consequences. The fact that Fine Gael and Labour are actively engaged in the dismantling of the welfare state is not a cause of concern for either party but then why should it be? Fine Gael has, after all, since the foundation of the State prioritised the interests of private business and the more affluent sections of the Irish middle class. It follows that in this political pecking order, the poor, the working class and the vulnerable are at the bottom. The Labour Party, on the other hand, claims a more noble history. It is the party of the great socialist and humanitarian James Connolly, a man who was born into terrible poverty, struggled for most of his short life to etch out an existence for his family and had to live with the added burden of disability and ill health.  Given such different beginnings, one wonders how we arrived at the current political juncture whereby a party that has a long history on the right of Irish politics finds itself in power with the party Connolly founded, namely, the Labour Party. Perhaps this is an overly simplistic answer to what is a complex question. Nonetheless, it is my belief that both groupings have been well and truly seduced by the trappings of power and have been rendered all but redundant by their wholehearted embrace of the cruel and ruthless neoliberal economic policies they so vigorously defend week in and week out in the Chamber. Having captured the State, they are now on a home run and have developed the capacity to defend the most heinous of cuts. Hidden in a discourse that prioritises the primacy of the market, their cruelty knows no bounds. Their mission, or so the logic goes, is to save Ireland from itself and in order to do this, the most vulnerable in our society, be they children, the elderly, people with disabilities, the poor or the sick, must be made pay the price for our supposed national rejuvenation which will, or so we are told, come about when the troika decides we have paid our dues to international financiers and capitalist marketeers. How else are we to make sense of the Minister's turnabout on the issue of home help hours? While in opposition, he criticised the plan of then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, to cut home care hours and restrict time spent on certain tasks, stating, "This draft plan is retrograde and flies in the face of what is clearly value for money". A year later, just months after taking office, the Minister told reporters, "I will be doing everything we can to ensure that, not alone there are no cuts, but we get an increase in home care help hours for people".

Since taking office in 2011, the Minister has significantly cut home help hours. Figures revealed by Age Action Ireland show that since 2008, HSE management has slashed home help hours by almost 20%. Almost one half of these reductions have occurred since Deputy Reilly was appointed Minister last year. However, what is most notable is that since Fine Gael and Labour came to power in 2011, the number of home help hours has slumped at an astonishing rate, from 11.2 million in 2011 to a planned 10.25 million by the end of this year. This fall includes a 500,000 hour cut earlier this year and a further 450,000 hour cut announced just two weeks ago. What is even more startling is that all of these cuts happened despite the number of people officially needing the support falling by just 9% during the same period. Yet again, the market-driven policies so beloved of right-wing parties like Fine Gael take precedence over the real and pressing needs of the most vulnerable in society. In this context, the comment by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, last night that no one would be left without a service cannot be taken seriously. When the Labour Party stands up in this House and defends these cuts, it is consciously and deliberately taking jobs and livelihoods away from the very people they claim to represent, namely the working-class women of Ireland. James Connolly would not agree with these cuts and the party he founded is no more.

In particular, I thank those who will then proceed to support the motion in the Sinn Féin Deputies' names. I thank those people from the home help sector who attended the debate last night and again tonight, especially those home help providers who gave personal testimony as front line service providers to Deputies yesterday in the AV Room. I urge all Deputies to reject the amendment in the name of the Minister for Health. It is an insulting amendment. There is no other way to describe it. There is not even within it an acknowledgement of the cuts that have taken place under the Minister's watch or the cuts to home help hours and home care packages over which he is now presiding. What we have instead is weasel words. Nothing else comes to mind when we examine what the Minister says. His amendment states, "anyone who has been assessed as needing a service will have that service provided". These are weasel words because they allow the Minister and HSE to weasel out of providing a service, even at the basic level of need, and to impose cuts. While an assessed person may retain the service, one must ask at what level. There is evidence to support my argument in many cases and we know it will unfold over time that home help hours will be greatly reduced, to the point where a person will merely have a 15 minute visit by a home help, as instanced during the course of this debate. This is absolutely outrageous. The Minister's words in this regard are also weasel words because they will continue to deny people with a genuine need from gaining access to supports. We have pointed out that by cutting back the home help hours and home care packages, the State will incur a greater cost because people will be forced out of the home environment into residential care. No head-waving by the Minister will change the unmistakable fact that we are facing even more serious scenarios as a consequence of these cuts because people will find themselves alone. Older people will die alone because the service will not be available to them. One should not forget the backdrop to this, namely, the work of Willie Birmingham in the 1970s and 1980s. We are returning to the grave conditions of those years because many older members of the population, whose average age is increasing, will not be able to gain access to the essential home help service that would give them comfort and dignity and the certainty of ending their days where they want to be. I ask every Member of the House to support the motion in the name of the Sinn Féin Deputies and to reject the outrageous amendment tabled by the Minister for Health.
