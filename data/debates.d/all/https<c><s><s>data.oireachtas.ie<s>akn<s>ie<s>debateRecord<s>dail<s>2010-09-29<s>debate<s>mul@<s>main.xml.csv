#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Efforts to regularise remuneration matters in the university sector have been  ongoing for some years. Indeed this issue was in the public domain prior to my  appointment and has been the subject of references in the reports of the Review  Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and in questions previously  raised in this House. More recently the issue of bonus payments in UCD came to  light in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report on  Resource Management and Performance in Irish Universities.I welcome the opportunity to put on record my disappointment and disapproval of  the unacceptable practice which existed in some universities of making  additional payments to staff in the absence of the requisite sanction.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Remuneration in universities is regulated by the Universities Act 1997.  While the Act confers a considerable degree of institutional autonomy, it provides that all forms of remuneration in universities, including allowances, are required to be approved by the Minister for Education and Skills with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It is regrettably evident that some universities did not adhere to the provisions of the legislation.  As soon as my Department fully became aware of the scale and extent of the problem in regard to unauthorised allowances in early 2005 it intervened to bring about a resolution.Following prolonged and extensive contacts and correspondence between my Department, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority and each of the universities concerned, agreement was finally reached in April 2009 which provided for the cessation of the unapproved allowances in the case of senior staff in universities comprehended by the review body.  This regularised the remuneration of the individuals concerned apart from a limited number of outstanding issues in some universities.Under the current legislation my Department is limited in its options in respect of the imposition of penalties to deal with breaches.  While the extra payments were ceased in April 2009, in most cases this did not have retrospective effect.  In view of possible contractual entitlements there are significant legal obstacles to recovering unauthorised payments from individuals.  That said, my Department adopted an approach of withholding both review body and general round pay increases from their due dates pending regularisation.  In addition, the question of imposing a financial penalty on particular universities involved in making unauthorised payments will be considered further with the HEA.My Department has sought and received unequivocal commitments from each university where unapproved allowances were paid that in future it will adhere to the provisions of the Universities Act.

Is it not a fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report into this matter makes that exceptionally clear?  Is it not a fact also that successive Ministers for Education and Skills have refused to deal with this issue?  When there is a troika of presidents in a university like Limerick drawing the presidential salary for two years at the same time, the Higher Education Authority estimates that over €4 million in taxpayers' money is being paid to top people in universities while at the bottom of the university ladder young junior lecturers cannot get in and get the hours and, most important, regarding the approximate 150,000 people in third level education, when thousands of them and their families are seeking to find €1,500 to pay the fees at the point of entry into college, will the Minister not agree that the Government should be ashamed of itself?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	4	No.  I do not believe the Government should be ashamed of itself.  The universities in question should be ashamed of themselves.  With autonomy comes responsibility and it is not too much to expect that highly paid senior management in our third level institutions adhere to the law without having to be constantly supervised.  As I stated in my opening statement, efforts to regularise remuneration matters in the university sector have been ongoing for some time and once the scale of the problem became apparent to the Department in 2005, extensive contact took place between it, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority and each of the universities concerned.  The universities have a great deal of autonomy under legislation and the House has placed much trust in our universities to manage their own affairs and they have a job of work to do to regain that trust.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	5	That job of work is being done in exceptionally good measure by many of the same universities which are in the top 100 by international standards and more power to them.  What is happening here is that people in these universities, who are in the public sector, are getting away with murder and the Government is letting them away with it.  This goes back to 1997; the Department and the Higher Education Authority knew and year after year letters were sent from the HEA to university heads stating that payments needed the sanction of the Minister and that they were unlawful.  As the HEA stated, what part of "No" did these people not understand?Are there implications arising from the Government's lack of control over all the public service quangos throughout the country?  A person in Coillte receives €450,000 a year, and the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority receives €750,000 when all of the bonuses are added in.  The public sector is out of control and is not being held accountable while the people at the bottom in education cannot afford to pay for their books or find the €1,500 required for third-level registration.  Does the Minister of State not think he and the Government ought to be ashamed of themselves for their lack of control and authority in this basic issue?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I repeat that the universities and people concerned should be ashamed of themselves.  As I stated, the issue was in the public domain prior to the Tánaiste's appointment and has been the subject of references in the reports of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and in questions previously raised in the House.  As I stated, as soon as the extent of the problem became clear in 2005, the issue was dealt with in a decisive way after subsequent long and protracted discussions and negotiations.  I and the Government regret this as much as Deputy O'Dowd does, but I want to assure the House that the Department has sought and received unequivocal commitments from each university where unapproved allowances were paid that in future it will adhere to the provisions of the Universities Act.  The House should expect that.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I am pleased to announce that the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 was published yesterday.  During the drafting process the Title of the Bill was changed to the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 to reflect the inclusion in the Bill of other provisions which require the amendment of existing education legislation.The Bill is designed to put in place a legislative framework which will facilitate the involvement of vocational education committees in the provision of primary education.  These additional powers for VECs are proposed in the context of the development of a new additional model of patronage at primary school level — a community national school.The Bill provides that subject to the consent of the Minister for Education and Skills, a VEC may establish and maintain a school to provide primary education and may also become patron or joint patron of an existing school.  Following the enactment of the Bill, VECs will be able to apply to the Minister for the recognition of a school in the same way as other patrons.  The Bill also provides that boards of management of schools under the new patronage model will operate in the same way as boards of management in primary schools generally rather than under the governance model used in post-primary VEC schools.The Bill also provides an opportunity to deal with a number of other education-related matters for which primary legislation is required, including the amendment of the Education Act 1998 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to provide clarification on the delivery of speech therapy services to students and to reflect the de facto position where the provision of therapy services is a matter for the HSE for whom voted funds are allocated for this purpose.  It provides for the amendment of the Education Act 1998 to provide for the abolition of the educational disadvantage committee.  This will implement an element of the Budget 2008 decision on the rationalisation of agencies.The Department of Education and Skills remains committed to maintaining ongoing consultation with the education partners and other stakeholders on educational disadvantage and the wider social inclusion agenda.  The Department will also continue to implement DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, which provides for the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIt provides for the amendment of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to allow for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under that Act — to reflect the reality that it is not always possible to engage a registered teacher and providing for the Minister to regulate for such a situation.The provisions contained in the Bill will be discussed in more detail during the passage of the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas.

In the section of her speech she was not able to read out, perhaps the Minister of State explained why, nine years after the Teaching Council Bill was enacted, she is now amending that Act so as to enable unqualified teachers to be hired in certain circumstances against a background where there is an excess of young, and not so young, teachers properly qualified who cannot get a job.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Department of Education and Skills has indicated that, in exceptional circumstances, where there is a need for teachers to be brought into schools, that need will be catered for.  I think that was what Deputy Quinn was asking me to explain.He asked me about further schools.

It cannot be because there is not a sufficient supply of qualified teachers.  Why is the Department leaving this back door open?
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is not a question of a back door.  It is a question of where there are exceptional needs that teachers with particular backgrounds would go into those schools.  I believe Deputy Quinn is aware of that provision in the Education Act.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In exceptional circumstances, that will be done.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I believe Deputy Quinn will be aware, without being pernickety about the matter, that there is a provision that where there is a necessity for teachers with a special requirement to go into schools who do not have the necessary qualifications, and subject to scrutiny from the Department of Education and Skills, they will be facilitated.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I appreciate that the Minister of State may not be fully briefed on all of this.

What we are trying to ensure here is that qualified teachers will be on a panel and will be available, and that is the regular practice.  It was understandable in 2001, when the Teaching Council Bill was enacted, that there needed to be a phasing-in period, but surely nine years is a sufficient adequacy of time to allow for that phasing-in to be closed, and that henceforth, when there are more qualified teachers than there are jobs for them, the back-door provision is no longer necessary.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I apologise if Deputy Quinn has trouble with the semantics of what I am saying, but I am fully briefed.  I have given him an answer.  If he requires a further answer, I will furnish it to him from the Department.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In Ireland, selected FÁS activities are co-financed by the European Social Fund and the Exchequer under the 2007-2013 Human Capital Investment Operational Programme, which has a 41% average ESF aid rate.  This operational programme has an overall allocation of €375 million in European Social Fund moneys with expenditure from 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2015 being eligible for ESF assistance.  The final payment application for this programme is due to the European Commission by 31 March 2017.FÁS has been allocated €211 million in European Social Fund moneys under this operational programme.  This allocation has been committed to FÁS programmes that deliver skills training for the unemployed and job seekers and to in-company training to the amounts of €201 million and €10 million, respectively.FÁS submitted its first claim under this operational programme in October 2008 for a €23 million European Social Fund, ESF, drawdown in respect of training for the unemployed and job seekers programmes.  In 2009, the European Commission undertook an audit of this claim and raised issues about it.  As a result, in 2009 it was decided to postpone claiming European Social Funds from FÁS expenditure until these audit issues were satisfactorily addressed and the necessary recommendations implemented.  To date, Ireland has met the deadlines for the full drawdown of available ESF moneys.  It is intended that alternative FÁS spending on skills training for the unemployed will be substituted for the amount of €165,000 in the next claim and, therefore, there will be no loss to the Exchequer over the programme period.After FÁS addressed the issues raised, the position was presented to the Commission for its opinion.  The Commission then completed a follow-up audit in March 2010 on these re-presented costs.  The Commission released its draft audit report on 16 June to which my Department responded on 24 August.  After review, analysis and further consultation, the Commission will issue a final position in connection with the audit.  Therefore, it is hoped that this process will allow for the submission of a FÁS claim and the related European Social Fund moneys to be drawn down in the near future.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The issues of concern to the Commission related to the methodology used in respect of numbers and costs, to tendering and procurement and to the extension of contracts.  These were the main issues raised by the Commission and, as I noted, processes are being put in place to deal with such matters.  I hope this answers the Deputy's questions.

At a meeting in December 2009, was it not agreed that the omission of a proper paper trail following the first audit meant that it would be necessary to examine all funds going back to 2000?  Is it not the case that there is no paper trail and that while estimates were given, the Department must now revert and get a paper trail that did not exist and was not available to FÁS at that time?

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The first area in which issues arose from this audit pertained to some documents relating to contract extensions and tendering procedures not being available for inspection at the time of the audit.  This will require a substitution of expenditure of €20,040 or 0.1% of the total claim.  The second and main area in which the issues arose related to the accrual accountancy methodology used by FÁS for reconciling the initial cost estimates of contracted training for the unemployed with payments made in respect of a number of actual participants.  The adjustment to convert from the estimated accrued cost to the actual cost was not calculated correctly to the tune of approximately €165,000, which represents less than 0.2% of the overall FÁS claim.  Alternative FÁS spending on skills training for the unemployed will be substituted for both of these amounts in the next claim and, therefore, there will be no loss to the Exchequer.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Is FÁS not a festering sore and did the question that the Minister of State stated was raised by the European Union not relate to the tendering process for FÁS courses?  Is it not a fact that a significant number of course providers in Ireland have corrupted examination results and that the Q-Mark they provide constitutes a question mark over the results they produce?  While the vast majority of companies are excellent and first class, a significant minority continue to abuse the system.  Is it not true that the recent report by the Comptroller and Auditor General identified more corruption in the provision of services to FÁS?  I refer to courses that were supposed to have been attended but for which signatures were forged and where no course actually took place.  Nevertheless, those concerned got the money and the taxpayer lost out.  In addition, the results in hundreds of cases have been held up.

Deputy O'Dowd raised this issue in the context of Question No. 102.  In the vast majority of cases in regard to contracted training and the issue of certificates, it was not a case of corruption or malpractice.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Labour Market Activation Fund, which I launched in March of this year, is designed to assist in the creation of innovative training and education provision by private, not-for-profit and public sector providers.  It is targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, namely, the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors, such as the construction, retail and manufacturing sectors, with particular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed.  Following an open tender competition in which 370 tenders were received, offers of funding were initially made to 26 organisations across the private, not-for-profit and public sectors to support specific training and education programmes for the priority groups.On 5 August, the Minister for Education and Skills announced the allocation of an additional €12 million to the fund, raising it to €32 million in all.  This has enabled my Department to offer funding to 33 additional projects from a range of private and public training and education providers.  This will bring to almost 60 the number of projects throughout the country being supported by the Labour Market Activation Fund.The commitment of additional moneys to the fund recognises the quality and diversity of the programmes tendered, and the overall level of demand evident for these programmes, and will bring to 12,000 the total number of places available to the unemployed supported by the fund.  Without exception, all of the projects approved for support indicated their acceptance of the funding offered.  In particular, all of the 33 projects benefiting from the extra €12 million funding that I made available last month have been actively involved in promoting their programmes and recruiting participants for training and education programmes scheduled to come on stream over the coming weeks and months.  Overall indications of interest and applications from would-be programme participants to date confirm the popularity of courses on offer.  While there has been some variability in the pace of applications across programmes, no programme has not proceeded due to insufficient interest from the public to date.  Several programmes have yet, however, to complete their recruitment processes.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I welcome the Minister of State's comments and the publication of this programme.  It is very necessary.  I draw his attention to a fact in which his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy White, will be interested.  The normal number of participants to make a course viable in Carlow IT is 60.  However, in regard to one of three courses, namely manufacturing, the threshold of requirement was 20.  An applicant was told there is not a sufficient number of people interested in this area.  The Minister of State, Deputy White, will confirm that there is, sadly, a significant amount of unemployment in Carlow.  The person in question, who has written to me about this, said there is little or no publication, either in the labour exchanges or other areas of public advertising, to draw attention to this.  There were three courses in question, all run by the lifelong learning department at Carlow Institute of Technology.  In the case of the course that did not proceed — the certificate in good management practice at level six — the Minister of State may well have been told by the college authorities that they are still trying to recruit people for it.  As of now, however, this course has not proceeded.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	50	This initiative was announced in last December's budget and further moneys became available during the course of the year.  Given the serious unemployment situation, providers throughout the State were called upon to rally to the cause and to come up with proposals at short notice.  Private providers are providing 21 projects, the VECs are providing 13, the third level sector is providing 19, and the community and voluntary sector is providing six.  Should it emerge in the coming weeks that certain programmes or courses are undersubscribed or are experiencing difficulties, my Department will work closely with the providers concerned to ensure they are afforded the greatest possible latitude in order to maximise participation rates and ensure participants who have already signed up can be facilitated.I welcome the information the Deputy has given.  This is a learning process for us in many respects and the programme will be thoroughly reviewed in the context of ensuring further provision.  However, if there are cases such as the Deputy referred to in Carlow and elsewhere, my Department will liaise with the providers in question to see what can be done.

I will furnish him with the precise details.  I understand this is the first time his Department has had substantial experience of dealing directly with the institute of technology sector and that there may have been a breakdown in communication.  If the particular applicant to whom I referred cannot be accommodated in the course for which she is qualified, perhaps she may be able, if there is some flexibility, to participate in one of the other two courses based at Carlow Institute of Technology.

I indicated my own view at the time of the desirability of sending a clear signal to second level students about the introduction of CAO bonus points for achievement in leaving certificate mathematics at higher level.Legally, the criteria for admission to higher education institutions are matters for decision by the institutions themselves.  The academic councils of these institutions determine the admission arrangements for students.  I wrote to the president of the Irish Universities Association, the chairman of Institutes of Technology Ireland and the president of the Dublin Institute of Technology asking them to give early and favourable consideration to the matter, in the context of a suitably devised bonus points system that will successfully encourage more students to study higher level mathematics.  The council of registrars of the institutes of technology has since indicated it is in favour of bonus points for mathematics provided they are implemented across the system.  Many but not all of the universities have also indicated their support for this.  The Irish Universities Association is working to promote a co-ordinated approach to the issue across the sector, and will keep me informed of developments.In the meantime, I indicated in my press statement of 18 August that students who are entering senior cycle in September should be aware of the possibility of additional benefits of taking mathematics at higher level in terms of CAO applications from 2012 onward and should take this possibility into account in making their leaving certificate subject choices.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	54	With respect, the Minister of State's response merely underlines the fudge on this issue.  As he said, the innovation task force recommended the introduction of bonus points for mathematics as essential to the development of the smart economy.  The National Competitiveness Council has consistently recommended their introduction, and the same recommendation was included in a report last week by Forfás.  Yet the Minister of State, who has responsibility for innovation, is obliged to request academic councils to give the proposal favourable attention.  That approach will not deliver what is required.  Students who will sit their leaving certificate examination in two years require certainty in terms of their decision to undertake, or not to undertake, the higher level mathematics course.  They need certainty, not more waffle, in terms of whether this is going to happen.  Dublin City University, DCU, and University College Dublin, UCD, have signed up to it and the institutes of technology will do likewise if it is introduced across the board.Is the Government serious about this proposal and will it signal to the third level institutions that this is an important issue?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I appreciate the Deputy's support and enthusiasm on this subject.  The Deputy will, if she is fair, acknowledge that I have been, in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and innovation, equally enthusiastic about this proposal.  I am also Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills.The institutes of technology are in favour of the proposal.  Three of our universities have indicated support for it, including the University of Limerick which is already operating the system.  The proposal has been considered by the academic councils of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin, both of which have voted in favour of it.  NUI Galway and University College Cork remain to be convinced of its merits.  NUI Maynooth is divided on the matter.  I am actively working with and trying to persuade university presidents that this is the correct decision for our leaving certificate students.  My children are not yet old enough to take the leaving certificate examination.  However, I know that many parents are aware of how difficult it is for a student to opt in to higher level maths, given the disincentive to do so.  Between spring and June, some 20% of students drop from higher level to lower level maths.  We need to increase the number of students taking higher level mathematics if we are to have suitably-qualified people in this area.

The Minister of State has stated his enthusiasm for the proposal, which I accept.  However, no action is being taken.  Do the universities buy into Government policy?  Is it Government policy that bonus points should be awarded to students taking higher level mathematics?  I believe it should be Government policy.  The Government has adopted the innovation task force report and, therefore, that policy should transfer into action on the ground.   We do not, as a nation, have time for messing around, trying to convince universities of the value of the system and waiting for a particular university to make up its mind.  If it is Government policy it should happen.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	69	My Department is acutely aware of the need for additional permanent school accommodation in the general Midleton area.  As the Deputy will be aware, Midleton has been identified by the Department's forward planning unit as one of the areas projected to undergo significant increases in educational demand in the coming years.To this end, the Department is currently in the process of acquiring a six acre site which is zoned for educational use.As part of the contract exchange, a planning application for an educational campus of two 16 classroom schools was submitted to Cork County Council in June of this year.  The purpose of this application is to ensure that the site to be purchased will be deemed suitable for land usage purposes to accommodate two schools.  The planning authority has requested further information from my Department and a response is being co-ordinated by my officials.  As part of framing this response, my officials recently met with the vendor to discuss aspects of the request for further information, which included information relating to traffic management issues.  My officials will be meeting with the planning authority in the coming week to discuss and address their concerns.  Pending the outcome of the planning decision, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to say definitively whether both of the schools referred to by him will be housed on the proposed site.  However, should the application be successful, it is my intention that priority will be accorded to the two schools referred to in the Deputy's question.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the Minister of State for her response.  Has the Department had any contact with the management of either or both schools in regard to the application made?  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate how much the Department is paying for the site.  Will she elaborate on the term "contract exchange", which she used?
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	71	As the planning application relates to ensuring certainty for the purchase of the lands in question, as distinct from the specifics of the building project, it was not considered appropriate to involve the schools in the contract negotiations.  That being said, I assure Deputy Stanton that the schools will be consulted in due course on the specifics of the building projects.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Is it true that the Department must pay a planning application fee of approximately €18,000 arising from the planning application because it did not identify the school that would use either of the sites?  Is it the case that the Department has paid €400,000 in rent for one of the schools in question over the past three years?
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Department has paid approximately €18,000 to the planning authority in submitting the relevant planning application.  This was based on the planning authority's implementation of the planning regulations which required payment of this fee where the prospective schools to be housed were not named.  Given the uncertainty of the planning application and the need to house both schools in permanent accommodation, it was not considered fair to either school to name them in the application.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The student support schemes for 2010 were published in May of this year.  Changes to the 2010 schemes were announced in advance by the former Minister when he published last year's grant schemes in July 2009.  The Minister gave advance notice of certain planned 2010 changes at that time by way of a press release on 29 July 2009 in order that students and their families would be aware of them in good time.The specific issue to which the Deputy refers relates to how students re-entering higher education after a break in studies are classified for the purposes of assessing them for a student grant.  This issue is governed by the break in studies clause in the student grant schemes.  The break in studies clause generally applies to students who take a year or more out after completing an undergraduate course and return subsequently to take up further third level studies.  This clause provides for the reclassification of such students allowing them to be means tested on their own income and that of their spouse, where appropriate, rather than being means tested on the basis of their parents' income.My Department increased the duration of the studies break requirement in the 2010 schemes from one year to three years.  This was done because in some cases students who would not otherwise have qualified for a grant on the basis of parental income were availing of a gap year which had the effect of creating a break in studies.  The break in studies clause, as it stood, allowed these students to be re-classified as independent mature students and to qualify for grants and fees based on their own, rather than their parents' income.  This was not the intention of the provision.  The intention of the clause was to focus resources on genuine second chance and mature students.  The increase to three years will ensure that the emphasis is, as intended, on facilitating such students to return to education.This change will not, as suggested by the Deputy, prevent continuing students from re-entering college for three years.  On the contrary, students who are already qualified for a grant based on a means test of their parents' income in previous years are likely to continue to qualify for a grant on the same basis, unless a favourable change of circumstances arose in the intervening period.  In that regard that the income thresholds to qualify for student grants and payment of the student services charge and-or fees remain unchanged for this year, despite the downward trend in average earnings.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	My understanding of Government policy, which Deputy Haughey's previous answer would seem to indicate, is that we should give people as much chance as possible to go back to education and re-skill where necessary.  In 2009, the scheme allowed that, all other things being equal, re-entry meant entering as a mature student following a break of at least one year.  Under the 2010 rules, re-entry must follow a break of at least three years.  This is forcing someone to stay out of the education system for an extra two years, all other things being equal.  What is the logic behind it?  Is it a cost saving measure?  Was there a loophole somewhere that was enabling people who did not otherwise qualify to get in?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I think I explained things reasonably well in my reply.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Minister of State read it out very clearly but he did not explain it.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I will try to explain it to the Deputy, particularly to a Deputy from the Labour Party.  The ultimate purpose of this change is to prioritise resources to those who are in genuine need.  Anecdotal evidence was brought to the attention of the Department that the scheme was being abused in certain cases.  People deliberately took a gap period in their education in order to qualify for the grant.  If these people had continued their education consecutively, they would not have qualified for the grant because they would have been assessed on their parents' incomes.  In some cases, people deliberately frustrated the intentions of the scheme solely in order to qualify for a grant.  Arising out of my response, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the change was signalled well in advance.  Its purpose was to prioritise resources and to focus them on genuine second chance and mature students.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Retirements at primary level since the introduction of the moratorium in March  2009 were 431 principals, 373 deputy principals, 201 assistant principals and  322 teachers with special duties posts of responsibility.  The equivalent figures for the post-primary sector were approximately 157 principals, 128 deputy principals, 1,144 assistant principals and 290 teachers with special duties posts of responsibility.  This is based on Department held data with a pro rata adjustment to include VEC schools. Unlike other areas of the public service, teaching vacancies continue to be filled.  Indeed, the number of teaching posts is increasing due to demographics and the allocation of the additional posts in the renewed programme for Government.  When the moratorium was introduced, the Government exempted principal and deputy principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is, therefore,  limited to the assistant principal and special duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.  Vacancies at assistant principal and special duties level arise due to retirements in these specific grades and typically also from the knock-on effect of filling principal and deputy principal posts.  What the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher.  The position whereby around 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.Some further limited alleviation was announced in July for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at assistant principal level.  The alleviation arrangements are set out in the published Department Circular 42/2010.  It provides some delegated sanction for post-primary schools to fill assistant principal vacancies if they fall below certain minimum thresholds.  The filling of these posts will be notified by the relevant post-primary schools to the Department over the coming weeks.  At this stage, the Department  has been notified in respect of the filling of 29 assistant principal posts.  Applications for alleviation in respect of 41 programme co-ordinator posts and ten director of adult education posts have resulted in 21 of these posts being  filled.  Applications for alleviation have also been received from over 110  primary schools and these are currently being examined and prioritised and the schools will be advised of the outcome in the coming weeks.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	88	It is sad that in 2010 a Minister of State is saying that these are only promotional posts and that they serve no other purpose.  It is regrettable that the Minister of State cannot recognise the functions and duties that were associated with these posts in the past and does not see their importance in the context of the effective running of schools.  Year heads have the first opportunity to identify, at an early stage, any problems that may arise for students at primary or post-primary level.  It is regrettable that the Minister of State associates posts relating to these individuals as merely promotional in nature.Approximately 1,200 of the type of teachers to whom I refer have retired since March 2009.  These people have been removed from the system.  It is a pity that the Minister of State is unfamiliar with the reality that obtains in schools because the work these people did was necessary before they retired and it remains necessary now.  Effectively, the middle management structure in schools has disappeared.  Many of the jobs in question — the Minister of State referred to them as promotional posts — related to transition year heads and they have been all but removed from the system.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the position and to restore these posts en bloc.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I thank the Deputy.  I am not sure if he posed a question.  However, the thrust of my——

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	92	——response to him is that this is a public service-wide challenge regarding how to deliver public services in the context of a reduced level of resources.  The Deputy is well aware of that.  I acknowledge that there is an uneven distribution of the reduction and that, in the context of attempts to alleviate difficulties, some schools have been impacted upon more than others.  That is why we have introduced some limited alleviation to deal with such cases, while continuing to reduce the overall number of promotional positions.I reiterate that I am not sure whether the Deputy asked a question.  If he requires a further answer, I will supply it later.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I am asking that the Minister of State reconsider the position.  We are concerned here with the effective running of schools and the demands that are made on teachers within school structures.  The posts which were created in respect of the effective running of schools have disappeared.  There will be a serious impact in the future if these posts are not restored as a matter of urgency.  Will those posts be restored?  I do not know how it is possible for Ministers to distinguish between particular areas.  Every school can make an effective plea in respect of the restoration of the posts to which I refer.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I thank the Deputy.  The suggestion that direct budgets to schools could in some way bring about a different outcome misses the point completely.  As the Deputy is well aware, the level of resources allocated for middle management in schools must be reduced.  This would be the case irrespective of the method used to provide funding.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The residential institutions redress scheme was introduced as part of the  Government's response to residential child abuse.  It was complemented by the  establishment of the independent Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the  National Counselling Service, the Origins family tracing service and the  Education Finance Board.  In tandem with funding for support groups, these initiatives represented a comprehensive and compassionate response to the abuse suffered by so many victims while also allowing a comprehensive review of the  causes, nature and extent of abuse.The Ryan report set out a series of recommendations to address the effects on those who suffered and to prevent, where possible, and reduce the incidence of abuse of children in institutions and to protect children from such abuse.  The  Government published a detailed implementation plan in July 2009 to address the report's recommendations.  This plan contains 99 specific actions and aims to strengthen significantly the existing child welfare and protection service.  The first progress report on the implementation plan was published during the summer.  A comprehensive agenda is being pursued and the recruitment of 200 extra social workers this year will help the HSE to deliver on its statutory responsibilities to children in care while HIQA will prioritise the inspection of child protection.  The Government is committed to improving and enhancing our child protection systems.The redress scheme was established in 2002 as an exceptional measure to address abuse in specified residential institutions and to quote the then Minister from the Second Stage debate on the redress legislation, "It is not, and was never intended to be, a panacea for every injustice committed on children".  The issue of including the Bethany Home in the scheme was considered previously when it was decided not to include it.Following the publication of the Ryan report in May 2009, there were a range of demands for the redress scheme to be extended to include specific institutions, including the Bethany Home, as well as specific categories of institutions.  The Government considered these demands and in its statement of 15 April last indicated that it did not propose to revise the arrangements.The redress board is now in the process of finalising the remaining applications before it and based on the total number of applications received, the final cost of the scheme will be of the order of €1.1 billion, while the overall final cost of the response to residential institutional abuse is estimated to reach €1.36 billion.Recent media attention has focused on the certification of Bethany House as a place of detention by the Minister for Justice in 1945 under section 108 of the Children Act 1908.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform has advised that it has not received any allegations of abuse from any female committed to Bethany Home pursuant to the Children Act 1908 and that it would be happy to deal with any such cases on an individual basis.

While it is an awful thing to say to him, there are 219 graves of children in Bethany Home.  They cannot speak because they died before their time, which clearly needs significant investigation and analysis.  There is evidence that it was not, as previous Ministers held, a home for mothers and babies.  It was a place of detention and the redress scheme allows for the investigation of institutions where individuals were detained.  I understand that the courts ordered mothers to be detained in Bethany Home.  There is at least one documented case of a person who having absconded from Bethany Home was brought before the courts and instead of being returned to the home had to serve a prison sentence.  Clearly they were sent there as part of the judicial system or as an accepted punishment of the State.While I am not being pejorative or judgmental, I repeat that those children cannot speak.  However, the survivors of Bethany Home can.  I heard them speak in Buswell's Hotel.  I heard a 70 year old man explain how his life was destroyed by what happened to him there and heard others recount their stories.  By looking at them it was clear that they suffered greatly.  I ask the Minister of State to review their case.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I accept the sincerity of the Deputy's comments.  This is an unfortunate series of incidents in the history of the State particularly regarding this particular institution.  There is an enormous volume of correspondence on file in the Department from this institution making the case and all sorts of evidence has been looked at.  At the end of the day, while the possible inclusion of Bethany Home could have been examined on the grounds that it operated as a children's home, other institutions such as psychiatric hospitals could equally have been considered.  However, the Government decided against extending the redress scheme, which has been in existence since 2002 and the redress board is finalising the remaining applications before it.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform is prepared to deal with any cases arising from this home on an individual basis given the information that has come to light.

If the issue is money, let us remember we are spending €30 billion on the banks.  The surviving people who lived in Bethany Home had their entire lives ruined by the experience.  I have heard what the Minister of State said about the Department of Justice and Law Reform, but I do not hear him saying anything about the Department of Education and Skills.  Is he saying that if the Department of Justice and Law Reform so recommends to him, he will include them?  Is further evidence being sought in order that they would be included in the scheme?  I understand it is the Department of Education and Skills that administers the scheme.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I regret that the redress scheme will not be reopened and that will not be reconsidered.  The Government has made a clear decision on that.  It has been reviewed over the years since its inception and different categories of people and institutions were brought into its remit.  However, unfortunately as regards this particular scheme, the matter is closed.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The selection criteria and process for admission to medical schools is a matter for the medical schools and universities in line with their statutory autonomy in academic affairs.The new entry process for admission to medical schools was introduced on foot of a recommendation of the Fottrell working group on undergraduate medical education and training that entry to undergraduate medical education programmes should not be exclusively determined by reference to leaving certificate performance.  The report of the Fottrell working group had been endorsed by the Government in 2006 to form the basis for a programme of reform and expansion of medical education and training.  The new mechanism which was introduced by the medical schools in 2009 is based on a combination of leaving certificate results and performance in an independent admissions test, HPAT, designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills.A research group comprising representation from the Council of Deans of Faculties with Medical Schools of Ireland, admission officers, the Central Applications Office, Irish medical education experts and international advisers has been established for the purpose of ongoing evaluation of the new entry process.  The work of this group will also inform a review of the new entry mechanism which will be undertaken within three years of its introduction.  I have been informed that the research group is examining the performance of candidates in 2009 and 2010 and in particular the performance of candidates who sat HPAT for the second time in 2010.  I am informed that the analysis of these results is ongoing but is expected to be completed shortly and will be made publicly available.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The HPAT is one centred on a multiplicity of questions designed to assess a person's overall suitability for medicine.  It is not an academic measurement of study, learning and memory.  However, the limited evidence on the basis of two examination years would show that the threshold has jumped and that those who benefited most in the second year of the test — this year — are those who had repeated the HPAT.  In many cases they had paid a considerable amount of money for grinds in advance of sitting the test, which is run by a private company.  While I take it that the Department is reviewing the situation, will the Minister of State ensure that the test should only be allowed to be taken once because the personality and suitability of a student will not differ dramatically between one year and another.  The limited evidence based on two sets of results would seem to suggest that those who repeat a HPAT are effectively getting an inbuilt advantage, which was not the purpose of the test in the first instance.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	113	On 3 August 2010, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills published the outcome of work undertaken by her Department, at the request of the Catholic Church, to identify areas that may offer potential for the church to divest its patronage of certain primary schools.  The possibility of the Catholic Church divesting itself of certain primary schools was raised by the church with her predecessor and discussed at a meeting in November 2009 with senior representatives of the church.  At the request of those senior representatives, the Department undertook to identify possible areas where the demographics and existing school configuration was such that there might be potential for the Catholic Church to consider divesting patronage.This report is now being considered by the Catholic Church authorities.  They may now wish to identify some areas to trial the modalities by which the number of Catholic schools could be reduced, thus releasing some schools for other patrons.  The decision on the identity of the particular Catholic school or schools to be trialed will ultimately rest with the local bishop, as patron, and the Catholic community in the parish or parishes concerned.  It must also follow consultation with the parent body and staff of the schools.Should the Catholic Church identify any such schools, there will be a need to put in place a range of processes, including appropriate consultation with staff, to address the implementation issues that might arise, such as ownership of buildings and transfer of staff.  These will include the necessary arrangements to consult and decide on the future patronage of identified schools.A meeting with representatives of the Catholic Church authorities is planned for today to explain the technicalities underpinning the information which was published.  While the Department has had no further discussions to date on these matters, issues around the recognition of new primary schools are being considered by the Commission on School Accommodation Needs for which the Department provides the secretariat.  Following consideration of a draft report from its technical working group at a meeting in June, the commission's chairperson, supported by a secretariat of staff from the Department, has had several bilateral meetings in August and September with groups which have nominated members to the commission.

I hope it will not take thousands of years in this case.A list of areas identified is contained in the departmental report.  There is no secrecy attached to this process.  A meeting has already taken place at the Department's offices in Marlborough Street.  No secrecy is attached to this matter as the results of this, and other meetings, have been made public through various press releases and statements.  A meeting is taking place today with the representatives of the Catholic Church to discuss the report's technicalities and how it will operate.  This is a long-standing and, possibly, sensitive issue.  Arising from an initiative made by the Catholic Church, and in particular the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, the process has been set in train and is continuing.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Does the Minister of State agree the process was initiated by the archbishop, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, who said having 92% of schools managed by the Catholic Church was untenable and that 50% would be more appropriate to cater for the Catholic community?  Will the Minister of State confirm, as has been stated in publicly released documents, that the deputation from the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference which met with the Department said it would only consider surrendering the patronage of schools in certain areas in return for the granting of patronage of new schools in built-up areas?  This is tantamount to the Catholic Church asserting it will hold what it has already.

Implementing this on the ground will be problematic.  As I mentioned, there will be a need for widespread consultation and a range of issues will need to be clarified.  It is my understanding that the Department is dealing with the Catholic Church on this issue.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Will the Minister of State offer his opinion as to whether we could have a better outcome for everyone involved if such discussions were conducted in the public domain at a forum in which all stakeholders could participate and the rest of the public could observe the proceedings?  Will he agree there should be no more secrecy behind closed doors in the negotiations on this matter between the Catholic Church and the Department of Education and Skills?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It is not the Department's intention to have any secrecy attached to this process because it is a controversial issue in some respects for some people.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	127	In July 2010, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills announced reforms regarding the probation of teachers.  She indicated it was her intention to place the responsibility for establishing arrangements for the induction and probation of teachers with the Teaching Council from September 2012, in line with the provisions of the Teaching Council Act.  The changes announced also involved the provision of a national induction programme for all teachers.  This is important because the provision of supports and advice to newly qualified teachers can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of the teaching profession.  The provision of a national induction programme for all teachers who are registered with probationary conditions by the Teaching Council will mean that for the first time all newly qualified teachers will have access to a year-long induction programme to support them in the transition from initial teacher education to full-time teaching.It was in light of the provision of this induction programme that the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills made changes to the probationary process for primary teachers.  Newly qualified primary teachers will continue to have to satisfy service requirements and professional competence requirements in order to gain full registration with  the Teaching Council.  However, the service requirement has been reduced from 178 days of continuous service, or 300 days of broken service, within five  years accumulated service to 170 days within three years from the date of initial registration with the Teaching Council.  In addition, in the past that service had to include two periods of at least 60 consecutive school days; from 1 September the requirement will be two periods of 50 consecutive school days.  This reduction in the service requirements will facilitate newly qualified teachers who may have difficulty finding regular work.Given the advice and support provided to these teachers in the induction programme, it has also been possible to alter the inspection of the primary teacher's professional competence.  The competence of the teacher will now be inspected over two unannounced inspection visits rather than during one unannounced and one notified inspection visit.There have been no changes to the service or professional competence  requirements of the probationary conditions attaching the registration of  post-primary teachers.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Does the Minister of State accept that the answer he read contradicts a previous answer offered by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White?  One side of the Department is extending the period where unqualified teachers can be hired at the discretion of a principal or board of management, while at the same time the window of opportunity for young, newly qualified teachers to get the necessary hours for full recognition is being squeezed from five years to three years.  That makes it more difficult at a time of a surplus of qualified graduates for them to gain the necessary hours to be fully qualified while leaving open a back door that will enable principals to continue to hire unqualified teachers nine years after the introduction of the Act.  This is the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing in Marlborough Street.

That will help teachers who are finding it difficult to achieve a regular position.  We are lessening the requirement deliberately to allow that to happen.  Deputy White can reply for herself as well.

There should be someone in the classroom to advise and help new teachers.  Many of the courses being provided take place outside of school hours instead of monitoring the teachers in school in real time.I have received a significant number of complaints about retired teachers who are working in schools while recently qualified teachers cannot get work.

Ultimately that decision is for school principals to make, the Department does not decide on the hiring of people.There are in-school arrangements being put in place under this induction programme.  Support will be given by principal teachers and nominated experienced teachers to teachers who are learning in the classroom.  There is no difficulty with that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Two years ago, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance met in Government Buildings and colluded with bankers to introduce a policy for a bank bailout that has proven to be the most catastrophic act in the history of the State.  We now have 455,000 on the live register, a deficit of €20 billion, €3 billion or more in cut backs in the budget in a few weeks, a national debt of €87 billion and over 200,000 people losing their jobs in two years, with 2,500 people who face being cut off from their electricity supply.  Once again emigrants are heading for foreign shores and there are 200,000 people in negative equity, many of whom have lost their jobs in the last two years.  There is no clarity from Government about how this will be sorted out.  There is despair, confusion and fear as a result of the uncertainty surrounding Government action.The Taoiseach is aware the Governor of the Central Bank said that, even with hindsight, the policy adopted by the Government was wrong.  The Taoiseach has said on more than one occasion that he accepts responsibility for all his actions in politics.  In view of the fact that the policy he has followed has crushed the spirit of many of the people, on this first day back in the Dáil, is he prepared to apologise to the Irish people for his actions, actions that have placed an unprecedented economic burden on their shoulders and those of the next generation?

It is unfortunate that Deputy Kenny continues to portray the motivation of the Government as being anything than that.The Deputy then goes on to misrepresent the report issued by the Governor of the Central Bank on the necessity for the guarantee, a guarantee that was supported by his party at the time.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The Governor of the Central Bank said in a report on the banking crisis that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place otherwise our banks would have run out of money within a matter of days and would have had to close their doors.  He went on to paint the appalling consequences of not supporting the banking system.  He said the closure of all or a large part of the banking system would have entailed a catastrophic, immediate and sustained economy-wide disruption involving very significant, albeit extremely difficult to quantify, social costs, reflecting in particular the fundamental function of the payments system in a modern economy.  These costs would have been broadly based in terms of income, employment and the destruction of the value of economic assets, and would have been on top of the recessionary downturn which had actually occurred.Let us stop peddling the myth that the guarantee was a misguided intervention.  It was supported, as I said, by the vast majority of this House, including the Deputy's party, and it is thanks to that decision that we have a banking system today.  We are in the process of restructuring that banking system and I believe that to continually portray that decision as anything other than being motivated by what was in the national interest — in fact it was confirmed by the Governor as being necessary regardless of what people might think of the situation — is not correct as it was a necessary decision which we now have to continue to deal with.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	145	It is another example of a member of Fianna Fáil never apologising.  When the Minister for Finance rang me on the morning of the fateful decision he asked me what Fine Gael's view would be on supporting the banking system.  I said the party will always support a banking system because it is the lifeblood of our economy.  I would like to know the conditions.The Taoiseach knew in advance, from Merrill Lynch whom he paid dearly and the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, that in certain circumstances Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent, yet he went ahead and made the decision to have a blanket guarantee.  The Taoiseach misled the public because he knew, as did the Minister for Finance, the real truth of the matter.  I do not know whether we will get that in the banking inquiry which will take place.On 16 January 2009, in reference to Anglo Irish Bank, the Taoiseach said it was in good stead and was solvent.  We were told by the Minister for Finance that this would be the cheapest bank rescue plan in the world.  We were told that the Irish taxpayer would not be exposed.  We were then told it would cost €2 billion, €4 billion, €10 billion, €16 billion, €24 billion and now it is a higher figure.  Does the Taoiseach not understand that on the streets and in the homes of this country what the Taoiseach has done, with his Government, has crushed the spirit of the people despite their willingness to work and create initiative?  The Government has crushed their spirit because it has no plan or clear agenda and it does not know where it is headed.In light of what has happened and what is about to happen, can I take from the Taoiseach that in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, whose unfinished building stands as an iconic failure to a cancer in Irish economics on the docks, the figure he will announce tomorrow on behalf of the Government will be the last time that he will come before this House to look for Irish taxpayers' money to get it and other banks off the backs of the Irish taxpayers?  Can the Taoiseach tell them this will be the last time he will come here looking for their money to bail them out?He started with a policy of no cost to the Irish taxpayer and has ended up with an unknown quantity of possibly €30 billion or higher.

It says the systemic importance of Anglo Irish Bank at that time cannot be seriously disputed.  He goes on to argue that the interconnectedness of Anglo Irish Bank vis-à-vis the Irish banking system meant that: "A disorderly failure of Anglo would have had a devastating effect on the remainder of the Irish banks".  Those are the objective facts as decided upon by Professor Honohan in regard to that matter.  The Financial Regulator, who is the person with the statutory authority and duty in this matter, will come forward with a figure which he, to the best of his ability, has been able to gauge at this point, as to what the overall position will be in regard to that particular bank.  It will be reported on that basis.

It was, of course, a decision to write a blank cheque for the banks and later today the Government will come into the House and ask us to extend that guarantee and, in effect, write another blank cheque.  The problem is that we do not yet know what was the size of the blank cheque that was written the last time.The Taoiseach told us on the day of the guarantee exactly two years ago that it was not going to cost the taxpayers anything.  Within three months the Minister for Finance was telling us that €1.5 billion had to be found for Anglo Irish Bank.  On 15 January 2009 he announced the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  On 29 May 2009 he announced a further €2.5 billion for Anglo Irish Bank.  On 30 March 2010 another €8.3 billion was allocated for Anglo Irish Bank.  There was another €10 billion after that.  By 10 August this year the total figure had reached €24 billion for Anglo Irish Bank.  On 8 September he told us that he did not know the final figure yet but that we would eventually be told it in September or October by the Financial Regulator.  I understand that we are to be told that figure tomorrow, the day after this House is asked to extend the guarantee.  We are being asked to write another blank cheque this evening and tomorrow we will find out the details of the last blank cheque which will be filled in.I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  Does he know the final figure for Anglo Irish Bank which will be announced tomorrow?  If he does know it, will he tell us now what it is?

It is being conducted at the moment and work is being finalised on it.  As soon as the figure is communicated to us it will be provided.On the question of the guarantee raised by Deputy Gilmore, the Labour Party alone in this House voted against the guarantee.  It has since sought to rewrite history to suggest that it merely objected to the extent of the guarantee.  The truth is it opposed the guarantee in principle tooth and nail.  Had it been in government the vista painted by the Governor of the Central Bank would now be our reality.  What is being portrayed by both Deputy Kenny and Deputy Gilmore in their questions, which suggest that this is the worst decision ever made, is not borne out by the report from the Governor of the Central Bank in whom I presume they repose confidence——

Is that the way the financial affairs of the country are being run?  Is the Taoiseach seriously telling us that the Government has made a decision to come in here and ask for another extension on the guarantee without knowing where we are in terms of the cost of the last one and, in particular, where we are in regard to the Anglo Irish Bank figure?  A columnist in one of the newspapers this morning said that the first thing one does in a crisis is face up to the reality.

Is the message going out to the markets that the Head of the Government does not know the bottom line for Anglo Irish Bank and does not yet know a figure that will be announced tomorrow?  In that situation he will be in here at 11.55 p.m., before the guarantee expires, to ask for an extension without knowing one of the most critical pieces of information that the taxpayer, the public and, I would have thought, the Taoiseach needed to know before he decided to come in here and put a proposal to the Dáil that it be extended.  That is not credible.We have an economic difficulty in terms of the perception of this country internationally, the lack of confidence that, unfortunately, this country has been experiencing in recent times and the way in which that is reflected in terms of the cost——

It is for the purposes of bringing certainty to the situation that we said that by the end of this month we would have a figure from the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator acts independently of me, as does the Central Bank.  It is not a question of a nod and a wink to the Taoiseach of the day.  It is a question of awaiting the considered judgment of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, which we will have imminently.To come back to the point, the reason we are seeking to do this is to provide greater certainty for ourselves and for markets which may factor that into their equation in terms of supporting us on sovereign debt markets.  That is what we are doing, and we are seeking to achieve that in an independent way through the Financial Regulator who, I presume everybody will accept, has a credibility built up in this area and is the best possible position we could put at this point.To take the Standard & Poor's position, it was suggesting the figure would be up to €35 billion.  I am not saying it is €35 billion but I do not know.  That has not been communicated by the Financial Regulator yet but suppose it was——

If it was of that order, the interest that would arise, taking the average this year and last year of 5%, would mean a payment of €1.5 billion every year.  The figure of €30 billion would be added to the national debt and as the Deputy is aware, the question of paying interest on the national debt and then paring down the national debt arises in regard to growth that comes into the economy over time, as happened in the past ten years during good times, when we saw our national debt-GDP ratio go down from €60 billion to €28 billion even though the volume payment of debt was around the same figure.  Our economy grew, therefore, and out of that we were able to reduce the percentage of our debt as a percentage of our GNP.If we look at the bank position and the reason the Governor would be suggesting this is a manageable situation, and I agree with him, it is on the basis of a €1.5 billion payment to be made annually.  Our current deficit, in terms of spending and revenue, is €18.5 billion.In the first instance we have to look at improving our public finances over a period that will deal with the current deficit of approximately €18.5 billion but in respect of explaining to the public the impact this has in terms of taxpayers' exposure and what it would cost, if it were a figure of €30 billion it would involve something in the region of €1.5 billion per annum.

Their work is ancillary to the work of the Government as a collective authority and meetings are held as necessary.  The Government committee on economic renewal was established in September 2008.  The committee was reconstituted earlier this year to incorporate the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation and was renamed the Cabinet committee on economic renewal and jobs.  Membership of the committee, which I chair, includes the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Other Ministers attend where required by the agenda.The Cabinet committee on economic renewal and Jobs has met 18 times to date, four of which took place this year, and is due to meet again on 13 October.  With other members of the committee, I also met with the heads of State agencies on 22 September to review their plans to support job creation and help the unemployed.  The meeting was briefed on latest progress by each of the agencies and it was agreed that the Cabinet committee would get quarterly progress reports on delivery of our jobs strategy across all sectors.We also identified a number of priority issues and initiatives which will be taken forward by Ministers and the Cabinet committee over the coming weeks.  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to work closely with heads of all of the State development and training agencies to monitor progress in their work, support them in their crucial work and to ensure that there is the sharpest possible focus on job creation across all parts of Government.I also chair the Cabinet committees on european affairs; social inclusion, children and integration; health; Irish and the gaeltacht; climate change and energy security; and transforming public services.  The Cabinet committee on climate change and Energy security last met on 9 October 2009.  The next meeting of that committee is scheduled for 6 October 2010.I am circulating in the Official Report, for the information of the Deputies, a list of Cabinet committees and their membership.Cabinet CommitteeMembershipEuropean AffairsTaoiseach (Chair)Minister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister for FinanceMinister for Health & ChildrenMinister for Foreign AffairsMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesMinister for Agriculture, Fisheries & FoodMinister for Justice & Law ReformMinister for TransportMinister of State for European AffairsAttorney GeneralClimate Change and Energy SecurityTaoiseach (Chair)Tánaiste and Minister for Education & SkillsMinister for FinanceMinister for the Environment Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesMinister for Agriculture, Fisheries & FoodMinister for Foreign AffairsMinister for Health & ChildrenMinister for TransportMinister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister of State for Science, Technology, Innovation & Natural ResourcesMinister of State for Horticulture, Sustainable Travel & Planning & HeritageAttorney GeneralSocial Inclusion, Children andTaoiseach (Chair)IntegrationTánaiste & Minister for Education & SkillsMinister for FinanceMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Health & ChildrenMinister for Justice & Law ReformMinister for Social ProtectionMinister for Community, Equality & Gaeltacht AffairsMinister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister for Children & Youth AffairsMinister of State for Housing & Local ServicesMinister of State for Disability Issues & Mental HealthMinister of State for Public Service Transformation & Labour AffairsMinister of State for Older People & Health PromotionMinister of State for Equality and Human Rights, & IntegrationHealthTaoiseach (Chair)Minister for Health & ChildrenMinister for FinanceMinister for Children & Youth AffairsIrish and the GaeltachtTaoiseach (Chair)Tánaiste & Minister for Education & SkillsMinister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister for Finance Minister for TransportMinister for Community, Equality & Gaeltacht AffairsMinister for Social ProtectionMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Foreign AffairsMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesChief WhipAspects of International HumanMinister for Finance (Chair)RightsMinister for Foreign AffairsMinister for Justice & Law ReformMinister for TransportMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesAttorney GeneralEconomic Renewal and JobsTaoiseach (Chair)Minister for FinanceMinister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesTransforming Public ServicesTaoiseachTánaiste & Minister for Education & SkillsMinister for FinanceMinister for Health & ChildrenMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local GovernmentMinister for Justice & Law ReformMinister of State for Public Service Transformation & Labour AffairsStrategic Directions for LocalMinister for the Environment, Heritage & Local Government (Chair)GovernmentMinister for TransportMinister for Social ProtectionMinister for Communications, Energy & Natural ResourcesMinister for FinanceMinister for Enterprise, Trade & InnovationMinister for Community, Equality & Gaeltacht Affairs

The motion in Fine Gael's name to be taken this evening under Private Members' business deals with the issue of jobs and job creation, which is critical to the economic renewal everybody wants to see happen.  The Taoiseach announced yesterday a plan to create 300,000 jobs over the next number of years.  I ask that we have the opportunity to have a real discussion about this important document in the House next week or whenever, but soon, and set aside perhaps three hours to allow Members give their views on the various sectors referred to in that document.  The fact of the matter is that much of it is double counting.  In the past ten years, companies supported by enterprise agencies did create 300,000 new jobs and they were all welcome.  However, it is also a fact that 350,000 new jobs were lost.  While every new job brings a spin-off——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	193	——it is difficult to quantify.  These are matters that are important and should be discussed here.  Will the Taoiseach instruct his Whip to provide an opportunity for a proper discussion in the House on the document he launched yesterday?The Forfás report published last week indicated clearly that if jobs are to be created and we are to have economic renewal, we need new investment in key economic areas such as broadband, water and electricity.  The point was also made that tackling the cost of services provided or regulated by the Government needs to be faced with courage and decisiveness, telecommunications and waste need to be dealt with and, critically, credit needs to flow to business.  Yesterday, I spoke to somebody who lost a job in one of nine shops that closed.  Wholesalers cannot collect money from retailers because retailers cannot collect money from those who buy.  Was the economic renewal committee given targets to aspire to with regard to seeing jobs created by the agencies?  Is it overseeing and driving economic renewal and the implementation of policy that co-ordinates Government job creation targets in broadband and in the smart economy document produced by the innovation task force?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	194	With regard to the trade, investment and tourism strategy drawn up by the relevant stakeholders concerned and the agencies who support them, it is a matter for the Whips to decide when they want to discuss the report.  It can be done at any time that is suitable.  What we are trying to explain is that there are areas of growth potential in the economy and there has been an increase in exports this year over last year.  Enterprise Ireland claims that this year, the companies it sponsors have regained 70% of the orders they lost last year and it expects them to make up the remainder next year.  Export performance has been remarkably resilient given the size of the difficulty in which the companies have had to operate.With regard to the overall economic policy being pursued by the Government, the question of the smart economy is about high productivity in all parts of the economy; it is not, as it is sometimes misrepresented, simply about white coats, PhDs and science labs.  It is about innovating throughout the economy so Irish industry and the Irish service industry can be competitive and can operate in export markets in addition to serving the domestic market.It is important to point out that one cannot decouple the question of economic recovery and job creation from the questions of putting the public finances in order, increasing confidence and ensuring we deal with having a restructured banking system.  Much as Deputies want to contend during Leaders' Questions that it is possible to have a banking system without providing the supports necessary to maintain it, the fact of the matter is that we would have a very serious situation and a constant decline in Irish economic fortunes were those decisions not taken.  There has been objective support of my opinion rather than of the assertions made by my opponents.The answer to the Deputy's question is that the Cabinet, which meets weekly, deals with economic matters on an ongoing basis.  Ministers are obliged, wherever their responsibilities require it, to implement those aspects of policy that have been outlined based on the resources that are available and the priorities now being set.  The revised capital programme is another example of bringing forward a revised programme based on the economic and financial realities with which we have to contend at present.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I do not know whether the Taoiseach's briefing document has the answer to this question.  In April, the Department of the Taoiseach stated that progress is already under way in a number of Departments in prioritising the implementation of task force recommendations which can be progressed in the short term.  Does the Taoiseach have any information from that section of his Department to indicate what short-term projects have been progressed in the past six months arising from that comment made by the Department?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	196	With regard to the innovation task force and the fund being set up, expressions of interest have been sought and advertised in international financial newspapers and people from abroad are in Ireland this week with regard to this matter.  That has been very much welcomed.  We also increased the level of research and development that will be available and that is set out in the revised capital programme.  We have also ensured that, starting this year, there will be double points for mathematics, which is another key recommendation.During the week, I spoke to people from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA who indicated that up to half of the recommendations are being implemented even as we speak.  It is a very important part of the work they are doing to provide more supports for Irish industry, to make it as competitive as possible and to ensure that innovation is at the centre of what they do.  This year, the 1,000th innovation voucher was issued to an Irish company; that is to say more than 1,000 companies use that scheme, which is a means of providing grant aid for the introduction of innovative practices into operations.  More than 300 research-led expert teams in the research and development area operate in Irish universities and institutes of technology on such matters.  There is a large range of ongoing activity in the area of improving Irish industry and making it more competitive in the innovation area.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Having neglected the jobs issue since even before the start of the recession, I was interested to see that during the month, two and half years into his term of office, the Taoiseach met the heads of the State agencies responsible for job creation.  In a matter of weeks, and just in time for the start of the Dáil session, a jobs document was launched.  I desperately want to believe that 300,000 jobs will be created over the next five years, and I desperately want to see that jobs document and launch being different from all of the other launches we had in the past on innovation, the smart economy and all of the other fine documents that emerged from Government which were then ignored as the publicity surrounding them began to dry up.Will the Taoiseach accept that if jobs are to be created in a serious way, he will have to adopt the type of proposals advanced by the Labour Party?  He rightly stated that the issue of creating jobs and economic recovery is bound up with the other two pillars of our economic problems, namely, the banking crisis and the public finances.  Therefore, will he accept the proposal being made by the Labour Party since the very beginning of the year for the establishment of a strategic investment bank, which would provide the type of credit to small and medium-sized businesses to generate jobs and ensure that finance is available for the type of infrastructure projects that might get people back to work in the short term?Is the Taoiseach prepared to take up the type of proposals that the Labour Party put forward in the area of tourism; the type of proposals advanced by Deputy Sherlock on the food industry; the proposals published by Deputy McManus on alternative energies; and the type of proposals advanced by Deputy Quinn on labour market interventions and the interface between getting people back to work, up-skilling and using the education and training system to ensure that people have new opportunities available to them and use the period of time when they are out of work to up-skill?  It is one matter to publish a document and to give the impression that 300,000 jobs will be created.  It is quite another matter to adopt the policies.

Unfortunately, there are not many who believe it will happen.  That is the difficulty.  It will not happen unless there are active policies used to pursue it and I am suggesting to the Taoiseach that he might take up the proposals that the Labour Party has advanced in this area.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	200	The Government has always been in the business of creating jobs.  Even at a time when we have had net unemployment, unfortunately, we saw in the two main sectors of the economy which are labour intensive there have been casualties but also jobs created.  These sectors are the construction related sector, where we have seen the loss of 150,000, and the retail sector, which is also labour intensive.  This has arisen because of the depletion in domestic consumption relative to the amount of consumption and demand that was being generated in better times.  As Deputy Gilmore will be aware, this is not a static figure.  Thankfully, 60% of those who, unfortunately, go on the unemployment register find employment within four to six months.  Of course, the problem is ensuring we help the increasing number of persons who are more than 12 months out of work and we have done that by doubling the number of training and education places.The elements of the jobs policy which have been consistent from the Government, even during difficult times, have been to drive exports and inward investment.  Even if one looks at 2009, which was a difficult year in that there was a contraction of 9% in the Irish economy, the IDA successfully obtained 125 projects for the country.  Some 70% of those projects were from companies which were already located in Ireland, which, I would suggest, was a strong vote of confidence by those companies in their experience here, both in terms of the quality of the people who are available and the means by which those companies have been able to flourish in Ireland because of the business-friendly environment we have been trying to create here over many years.Increasing competitiveness and productivity has been another function.  We have seen improvement in competitiveness.  That has been referred to in economic studies that have been done since then.  Another has been helping the unemployed through activation measures, employment schemes, training and upskilling.  I could go through a range of them.As Deputy Gilmore will be aware, there has been a major capital investment programme.  That is supporting approximately 30,000 jobs per year.  So far this year the IDA has secured 75 investments.  Enterprise Ireland is supporting approximately 75 high-performance start-up companies in addition to what it is doing in terms of management support and enterprise support, and what we have done on the employment subsidy scheme in helping over 1,700 companies with maintaining approximately 104,000 jobs which were in viable but vulnerable businesses during that difficult downturn.  That scheme would be claimed by many to have been a good initiative by Government in the context of the challenges that those companies were facing.  Given how difficult it is to recreate jobs once they are lost, maintaining those people in employment and keeping those jobs going in those companies was a significant contribution last year by Government to maintaining employment.  Similarly, there is the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, from which almost 220 companies have benefited.  I do not accept that the Government has been either indifferent or non-proactive on all it can do in these matters against a difficult background.Taking one of the points Deputy Gilmore makes, I have seen the strategic investment bank proposal.  I understand the proposal is to take €2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is not clear where the supplementary private capital comes from for that.  Does it come from the capital base of our existing banking system?  To what extent would that deplete our own system?  It has not been made clear.Deputy Gilmore often makes reference to 54 policy documents or initiatives that have been mentioned by the Labour Party under his leadership.  I am not sure any of them have been costed.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I had a list of many of them.  I take it that they are various points of view that have been put forward, but the point I want to make to the Deputy relates to the targets that are set out.  These are targets that are not mentioned specifically in the report that was launched yesterday.  "Making it Happen" is a report from the IDA, which set out its view of what it can deliver for the country between now and 2020.  The IDA has been indicating that even last year, for example, Ireland got more foreign direct investment to its shores than Britain did, and Britain is 20 times our size.  There has been a successful diversification of the Irish economic base during the good times which has stood us in good stead.While there has been a debacle in the domestic retail banking sector it is interesting to note that in the International Financial Services Centre area employment has been maintained in the main and continues to grow in certain sectors.  The figures mentioned in this documentation refer back to the State agencies' policy positions.  The 780 inward investments that the IDA expects in the coming five years are based on its own projections, experience and pipeline proposals and is predicated on growth in the world economy which has returned this year and is expected to continue.When I hear the Leader of the Opposition stating that the spirit of the nation is broken, there is no future, there is no hope and it is time to close the door, if that is the sort of leadership that people want provided, maybe they should listen to Deputy Kenny or Deputy Gilmore.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I have been raising the issue of employment and the loss of jobs since long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and long before the banking crisis and the official start of the recession in this country.  The reality is that since Deputy Cowen became Taoiseach the country has lost on average 320 jobs a day.  This is the 16th month that the live register figures are over 400,000.  One in every three on the live register is out of work for over a year.There is an urgency about getting people back to work and it is very much about how one does it.  The Labour Party has suggested that one of the ways of doing that is by establishing a strategic investment bank.  If the Taoiseach had read the document — clearly, he has not — he would have seen that the proposal was to take €2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to use to leverage another €20 billion to ensure that credit is made available to small and medium sized business because, as the Taoiseach well knows, it is not happening from the mainstream banks despite their protestations.  It would also make money available for the financing of the capital programme.  We know there is a problem with the financing of the capital programme because of the restrictions on the public finances.  We know that the PPP model is not now operating and we must look at different ways of ensuring that there is finance available to advance the capital programme which would get people back to work, for example, in construction.The Taoiseach correctly stated that construction is one of the areas where there has been a significant drop in the numbers of people in employment.  People can be got back to work in construction through the public programmes to build the schools and hospitals that need to be built.  They can also be got back to work in the retrofitting and renewal of buildings, and in the area of energy conservation.  However, it needs some means of being financed and this was one point on which the Labour Party argued for it.As for the retail area, which the Taoiseach rightly identified as having experienced a significant fall in employment, Deputy Ciarán Lynch made a proposal in this House on behalf of the Labour Party in which he stated that one problem identified by the retail sector was that retailers were unable to revise downwards the rents into which they were locked when times were good.  I refer to those who went into some of the new glossy shopping centres and who, before being let units in such locations, had their arms twisted to accept extortionately high rates of rent and who now cannot review them downwards.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch put forward a set of proposals in this House that would have allowed for the downward revision of rents in these different times but the Government voted them down.  Moreover, the Minister gave a convoluted answer involving the Attorney General, legal reasons and so on.  These are practical proposals.

One problem has been that the Government, which should have been on top of the unemployment problem at a much earlier stage, is now coming to it late in the day.  I found it astonishing that the Taoiseach only met the heads of the agencies a couple of weeks ago.

The document was prepared by the people in the industries who are charged with their promotion long before it was decided when the Dáil would return.  It was approved and launched by the Government, as it is quite right and proper that people should know about it.  They were not going to hear about this sort of opportunity from the Opposition.  Second, on the question of a strategic bank, the Deputy has not told me how he proposes to collateralise the €20 billion.  From where will he get the €20 billion?

Does he propose to take it from the deposits of existing Irish banks, thereby necessitating their recapitalisation to a greater extent?  Does the Deputy want to work this out?  He also made reference to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, that is a commercial fund and such money can only be taken on a commercial basis and, consequently, if one does so to set up such a bank, one must ensure there is a return on it.

One cannot decouple job creation or economic recovery from getting the public finances into order.  While everyone agrees with this point in principle, as one goes about doing it everyone disagrees with every cut and comes into the Chamber to make a representation as to why it should not take place.  The point is that we are spending €50 for every €30 we take in, which is not sustainable.  If we want to create jobs and have a competitive economy, one must deal with this issue.  One cannot walk away from this issue and the point I made earlier was that the deficit there is €18.5 billion.  As for the previous discussion on the banking situation, which is also serious, if €30 billion is what ultimately is to be paid, that would mean a payment of €1.5 billion.

The Deputy should not be trying to suggest, as he is, that it was the scope of the guarantee the Labour Party was against, even though none of the subordinated debt was called upon and much of it, incidentally, was discounted during the time it was in play anyway.  However, Deputy Gilmore is now trying to be Mr. Responsible.  He is playing the old populist game again by stating that he is against the guarantee because he is against the banks.  This is the line he is playing and he is winning out there with it.  He is winning because what he is trying to do is to tell people that they can have an economy but should not have a banking system.  I am afraid it does not work that way.  Nevertheless, the Deputy will get plenty of kudos from so doing because that is the way he has been carrying on.  He is playing the old game and hoping to get a few votes out of it.

I try to be constructive and offer suggestions.  He launched this document yesterday that refers to 300,000 jobs.  It would be great were that to happen and the Labour Party certainly will support whatever must be done to make it happen.  However, the measures that are required to make it happen are not there.  It is cruel to tell people who are out of work and who are worried about the future that 300,000 jobs will be created.  They do not believe it and I do not believe anyone in this room believes it, other perhaps than the public relations people who have been spinning it.

I have been suggesting such practical measures to the Taoiseach.  The Labour Party makes proposals in the House, some of which I have identified.  It puts them on the Dáil agenda and the Government votes them down.  I put them forward and try to argue them with the Taoiseach.  I suggest them and advance them to him——

It is the single biggest thing that must be done in Ireland.  While I note the Taoiseach's points about the public finances, the banking system and so on and accept they are the other two legs of it, we cannot get economic recovery unless we get people back to work.  The Government will not solve the problem in the public finances unless it gets people back to work——

He stated that we brought forward a glossy strategy and that while he hoped it was there, he did not know what was its basis.  It is based on the policies of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  Consequently, if he wishes to question the ability of Frank Ryan and Barry O'Leary to deliver, he should say so openly because that is the basis on which those figures are geared and have been brought forward.

Instead he wants to start another bank.  Where is the consistency in his approach?

Obviously, it would be coming from the funding base of the two existing banks.  This evening, Members will attempt to make sure that we have a banking system that I acknowledge requires improvement and restructuring and that must get more credit out to business.  However, if we are to recapitalise our banks, one should not talk out of both sides of one's mouth.

It had nothing to do with Cabinet committees, was a specific stand-alone question and could have been taken accordingly.  That said, the Taoiseach should provide Members with a couple of examples of practical measures that were identified and agreed in the course of his meeting with senior representatives of the 11 agencies on September 22 last that would contribute towards both the protection of existing jobs and the creation of new jobs in this economy.  I will give two examples.  Was consideration given to the restoration in full or the acceleration of a schools building programme that would allow for the provision of much-needed infrastructure and the creation of employment in construction?  Was consideration given to an adjustment in local authority and public sector contracts in construction service procurement that would allow for a more level playing field for smaller businesses and businesses generally?Let us consider breaking down tenders into smaller parcels.  This is normal procedure across the majority of EU member states, yet it seems to be frowned upon by the Irish Government and its Departments and agencies, with the result, for instance, that all the leaving and junior certificate examination papers for this year were printed in Britain.

There are practical steps that can be taken.  It is not in contravention of EU diktat to break down tenders into smaller parcels.  It happens in almost all other member states.  Why we cannot act imaginatively, ensure that work is created in Ireland, allow for the sustaining of existing employment and help in the creation of new jobs is simply beyond my understanding.  The Taoiseach has come very late to this.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Has the Deputy a question?

Will he stand over them?  Will he get behind the proposals and plans announced over the past 24 hours and ensure the resources essential to bring them to fruition will be provided?  If the Taoiseach would answer both those questions, I would be thankful.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Any meetings I had were to talk about what is being done and consider whether the agencies have other ideas that we could modify and bring forward.  Those ideas are being considered at present.  It is often forgotten that FÁS is also an employment service organisation.  Some 62,000 people will be taking up employment as a result of jobs advertised through that agency alone, quite apart from other employment agencies.  The number of people coming in and out of the workforce is not a static figure.  People are moving in and out of it all the time.  That is not often appreciated in terms of how the labour market works or what job opportunities arise.  It is often overlooked.I listened to what the State agencies had to say on how we might improve, where possible, existing policies and how we might better support businesses, including small and medium-sized businesses.  One of the tasks we must also complete is improving credit access because it is fundamental.  Many of the arguments we are having on banking here overlook the fact that unless we have a functioning banking system, we cannot have a functioning business sector.  We cannot maintain, create and grow jobs without the certainty and predictability of access to funding.  That is why we must make certain decisions and put the line under certain issues.  Unless we do so, we will continue to be handicapped by people not being able to gain access to the funds they need.  I am thankful, however, that Bank of Ireland and other banks are in a position to get funds from international markets and do the business of banking, which is about providing money to those who have viable projects, businesses and operations and to ordinary consumers who require banking services just to conduct their daily lives.  We must take cognisance of this.With regard to the specific meetings that were held, there were talks with FÁS on what schemes could be improved.  There were talks with Enterprise Ireland on what further assistance we can give.  It is important to note the green enterprise action plan.  All such issues were mentioned.  Some 5,000 people are employed in energy-efficiency retrofitting.  These initiatives are being taken on.  We have seen what has been done in respect of tax exemptions for those who set up their own business and PRSI exemptions for employers who take on more employees.  We are doing all these things.  Ultimately, however, while they are helpful for thousands of people, the fundamental question of how we keep 1.8 million people at work and get more enterprises to provide more permanent and gainful employment is one of ensuring we have a competitive economy, driving our exports, cutting our costs and getting our public finances back into order.  Unless and until we do that, we will not be looking at the core of the issue, namely, making sure that we support enterprise at a difficult time for it but also get our public finances back into order.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	281	There are many so-called economic commentators who support the Taoiseach's particular approach.  One of the flaws in their respective presentations time and again is the view that a stimulus package must wait until after the deficit is addressed by 2014.  All these points must be addressed together.  We must address the deficit, not by the means that the Taoiseach has promoted over three successive budgets.  There are alternatives and we ask the Taoiseach to consider them.  We have submitted them, argued in their favour and put forward cogent reasons they would work better, but the Taoiseach does not give them any consideration.The jobs measures announced by the Taoiseach yesterday are high on targets, which is welcome, but low on substance in terms of how they will be realised.  I ask the Taoiseach to put the meat to the bones and outline in this House exactly what practical steps he proposes to take.  He has given us nothing in regard to his response vis-à-vis the meeting last week with the 11 agencies.  Once again, it is all broad-brushstroke stuff.  There is no detail on practical steps that can be taken.  I ask the Taoiseach again to consider the arguments being presented by Opposition voices who are putting forward real and sound proposals that will sustain existing employment and create new employment, and which the Government now has an opportunity to influence.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will consider some of the simple, practical propositions that we have put forward, only two of which I mentioned?  We put forward a document containing 80 prior to last year’s budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	282	As I said to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the issue is that there are a number of practical steps being taken in a range of areas to assist businesses and assist in the creation of jobs, quite apart from the macro-economic imperative of getting our public finances in order.  There are significant funds available.  With regard to developing the tourism product, the allocations have been trebled.  Over €130 million was allocated to support viable but vulnerable industries.  Over €130 million was allocated for the retrofitting scheme.  Some 60,000 homes have been retrofitted under the scheme during 2010.  That is not an insignificant amount of work when one considers that, in a normal construction era, 30,000 to 40,000 units per annum would be regarded as the normal demand.  This would be the case in more normal times, such as those before what happened in the noughties, that is, between 2000 and 2010.  There is now a surfeit of housing capacity.Many people formerly in the construction sector are now registered under the energy efficiency schemes.  One sees many of them going about their business in vans all over the country.  People are getting work under the schemes and more can be done in this area.  I have been asking what we can do to assist the construction sector bearing in mind that there is a surfeit of homes.  The energy efficiency area is an obvious area and the allocation for this area is not insignificant.  The money allocated is money that would never have been allocated, even during better times.There is a range of actions.  The Deputy asked about the stimulus package. The stimulus package provided in other European economies had an impact amounting to approximately 2%.  We are providing, through our capital investment programme, a stimulus of between 4% and 5%, all of which is borrowed money.  However, we are providing it because we want to invest for the future.  We are investing in our infrastructure, not only our physical infrastructure but also our health and education infrastructures, in an unprecedented way.  This has been the case even in the past three years, despite the economic difficulties.  There is a need and demand for this.  The investment in third and fourth level education has been hugely significant, including in Science Foundation Ireland.  In the arts, I recently attended the opening of the centre for performing arts at the University of Limerick, a magnificent new addition to the college's infrastructure.  I congratulate Micheál Ó Súilleabháin and the others involved in that initiative.  Across the board an effort is being made whereby public investment is seeking not to replace but to make up in some respects for the loss of private sector investment in some of those areas which were labour intensive.  We are doing that and the evidence is there to be seen.  In terms of the multi-annual investment programmes, there is talk of how sceptical people are in regard to jobs targets, even though previous jobs targets were met.  In regard to the national motorway system, for example, I recall there were many who doubted very much that it would happen.  In fairness to the NRA, it built up the capacity and expertise and delivered on time and within budget and, in many cases, before time and within budget.There are things that are being successfully achieved.  Yes, there are challenges we must face up to.  Yes, there are more initiatives we must look to in terms of work placement, helping graduates who are unemployed and so on.  We will work on these issues.  It cannot be said that the Government is not proactive in this area.  We are being proactive in every way we possibly can.  However, at the end of the day, we have to continue with the overall macro-economic policy which has stabilised the economy this year and stabilised unemployment to a greater extent.

The Minister concerned has been in the news in recent days.  The point has been made that the conference the Minister is attending was arranged by her predecessor and that there was no facility to change the position of these questions on the rota because this is the first day of the Dáil session after the summer recess.  If it is true that this matter was arranged before the summer, then surely the facility existed to have the rota changed back in July.  I make this point to the Chairman of the House for accuracy.  It is not true to say that these questions could not have been changed.  If this conference was arranged, agreed and set up during the tenure of the Minister's predecessor, then there was ample opportunity to change the rota in July.  I make this point for accuracy.

Are the arrangements for the motions re the three by-elections agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the terms of the draft scheme entitled Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010 agreed to?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The Labour Party does not agree to the arrangement for the taking of No. 16.  This is the proposal the Government is bringing to the House to extend the blanket guarantee that was introduced two years ago.  Whatever justification there might have been two years ago — that the Government was up all night and had to bring the matter before the House in a rush and put the gun to our heads to agree to it — there is no justification whatever for the same procedure being used in 2010.  This House has been closed down by the Government for the past 12 weeks.  I would have expected, at a minimum, that if the Government wanted to put this motion before us the Dáil would have been reconvened earlier than today and that adequate time would have been allowed to tease it out and discuss it, thus allowing us to represent the people who elected us to this House.Second, this proposal is, extraordinarily, being put to us the day before the Financial Regulator will publish what we are told will be the final figure in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, a figure which the Taoiseach tells us he does not yet know.  The Dáil is being asked to write another blank cheque following which we will be told tomorrow what was the size of the previous blank cheque.  This is the wrong way to go about dealing with what is a serious motion before the House.  The scheme introduced two years ago tied the State to the banking system at the hip, the consequences of which we all know, and we are now being asked to extend it and to have this all done and dusted in a couple of hours.  The Labour Party will not agree to that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I share the sentiment that extra time should be allowed to deal with the motion.  Perhaps I can be helpful to the House.  This is an important matter.  It is important we distinguish between the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010 and the original guarantee put through the House two years ago.  It is fundamental that we have a banking system that works in the interests of keeping the life blood of the economy moving.  There are difficulties in this regard in terms of credit and the unavailability of loans to businesses, hundreds of thousands of whom are hanging on by their finger nails.  To be of assistance, Fine Gael is prepared to reschedule its Private Members' Business re proposals for jobs to tomorrow if the Taoiseach is willing to commence the debate on the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010 this evening at 7 p.m. and conclude it at 9 p.m.  This would provide us with an extra hour and a half to debate the motion.  The Order of Business for tomorrow could be changed to allow Fine Gael's Private Members' Business to be dealt with in a three-hour session.

Apart from the fact that a guillotine of 9 p.m. is being applied, which is objectionable in itself and is an action usually the preserve of Government towards the end of a session rather than on the first day back, we are once again being asked by this Government to buy a pig in a poke.  I do not need to have explained to me the importance of having a credible banking system in which we can have confidence.  Sinn Féin demonstrated its acceptance of this when it participated in the vote on 30 September 2008.  What went wrong subsequently is that the commitments received from the Minister and our reasonable expectation of how the guarantee would be presented, advanced and legislated for was totally at a remove from everything we were given to believe.The record of the House shows that I repeatedly asked the Minister for Finance on the floor of this House on that evening if he had any further information that was pertinent and relevant to our taking whatever decision we were to take in regard to the proposition and that he did not state any reason for further concerns.  We have since learned that the Minister then had critical information in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, which he learned on the evening before from representatives of the two main banking institutions in this State, namely, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank.  The Minister withheld critical information from Deputies on the floor of this Chamber, which is a damning indictment of him and the Government.  We cannot trust the Government.  The people do not trust the Government; that is a fact.Sinn Féin was prepared to, in good faith, accepting the basic principles of the argument——

I am stating them now.  I am objecting to the taking of this proposal, as is my right under Standing Orders.  Let us get that right from day one of this session.Once again, we are being asked to agree to an extension of what has proven to be a disastrous proposition in relation to an almost gilt edged bank guarantee that has been used by many to serve their particular interest and is running totally contrary to the interests of the overwhelming majority of people in this State.  We are on the one hand being asked to continue the bail-out of a toxic bank, namely, Anglo Irish Bank, and on the other hand to accept yet another dollop of cuts to be introduced by Government on 7 December next which will add further pain and penury to people already burdened with both.I do not know the name of the toxic bank protestor outside this institution this morning——

I hope he is not detained too long.  I can tell the House the names of those who should not alone be detained at that Garda station for questioning for a long time but who should be put through the rigors of the courts of this land for what they have done and have inflicted not alone on this generation of Irish people but on future generations.  I refer to those at the helm of the toxic Anglo Irish Bank and other banking institutions in this State who have never been called to heel or account.

The Governor of the Central Bank has recommended extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme to 31 December 2010.I say again to those who suggest it was an option to allow this bank to go — as people are suggesting now in retrospect — to look to the conclusions of the report confirming its systemic nature, the impact that would have had on the economy generally and on the banking system generally.

Third, in February of this year, the committee dealing with children's rights agreed a wording for a children's rights referendum.  This wording has been with the Attorney General for quite some time.  I note that the referendum Bill is not in the legislative programme.  Does the Taoiseach expect the Attorney General to complete his analysis of the wording in the foreseeable future and is it still the intention to hold a referendum on children's rights in 2011?  Finally, on a number of occasions this week, the Taoiseach spoke about parliamentary democracy and how a Government majority is maintained by parliamentary democracy.  Will he save himself having to vote on three separate motions regarding the pending by-elections?  If he is so convinced of the importance of parliamentary democracy and the maintenance of his majority in the House will he not tell us he will hold the three by-elections and get on with it?

The Taoiseach, in his reply, said something to the effect that the budget date that has been mentioned is 7 December.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the date of the budget is 7 December, or does the Government have any plans to bring budgetary measures before the House before that?

When one looks at the legislative programme published today one sees the National Vetting Bureau Bill, which is an outworking of the first report of the committee on children's rights.  In the summer legislative programme, a promise was given for publication in 2010.  The report to which I refer is the first to be produced by the relevant committee and it deals with various issues relating to vetting, soft information, etc.  However, there appears to be a further delay on the part of the Department of Health and Children in bringing forward the essential legislation in question.  The position is the same with regard to the referendum on children's rights.  There have been worrying indicators with regard to these matters in the recent past.In light of the importance and seriousness of the issue involved, is there nothing that can be done to bring forward the national vetting bureau Bill in order that we might, at the earliest opportunity, give legislative effect to some of the work of the committee?  Will the Taoiseach provide a clear undertaking to the House that the referendum on children's rights will take place, if not before the end of this year — that would have been my preference — then during the first Dáil session of 2011?  All Departments have been given ample time to consider the ramifications for and impact on their areas of responsibility to which the adoption of the wording that was unanimously agreed by the members of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children would give rise.It must be borne in mind that during the joint committee's deliberations, each of the political parties undertook to——

It is the responsibility of the Government to bring forward the question to be put to the people in the referendum.

However, the Bill is being treated with priority by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

It appears that other legislation is being given precedence.  In order to be given precedence, the name of a Bill must appear on the pink pages of the legislative list.  A classic example in this regard is the legislation listed at No. 10 on the pink pages.  The purpose of the legislation to which I refer is to provide for a directly elected mayor for the Dublin region and for the powers, functions and election of the mayor and regional authority.  That legislation is more important than the national vetting bureau Bill simply because it is listed on the pink pages.  In light of all the issues that have arisen regarding this matter and in the context of the various replies the Taoiseach gave to Members in respect of it, why should the legislation relating to the direct election of a mayor for Dublin be given precedence over the national vetting bureau Bill?

I wrote to the Minister some weeks ago to clarify whether legislation would be required in this regard.  I received a reply last evening in which the Minister stated that it is not clear at this stage whether legislation is required or whether the plan can be implemented fully within the parameters of existing legislation.  The reply further states that this matter is being explored in the detailed work to develop the plan.  Government Members have all been on holiday, and working in their offices and at meetings for the past 12 weeks or so.  It was extraordinary to get a response last evening from the Minister for Finance.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Anglo Irish Bank is the biggest liability and undertaking the State has.  I ask the Taoiseach, as Head of the Government, about the new plan, announced by the Minister after Commissioner Almunia turned down the good bank-bad bank proposal for Anglo Irish Bank as not being acceptable.  As the Government has had several weeks to digest the Commissioner's decision, has it decided whether the proposed funding bank and asset-recovery bank for Anglo Irish Bank require legislation?  I believe that question is perfectly in order.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The Deputy will have ample opportunity to raise that matter after 7 p.m. when the debate starts.

There are already banking licences in existence in relation to Anglo Irish Bank.  On the splitting of the bank as agreed by Government, if there are legislative requirements, they will be brought forward by the Minister for Finance.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	443	As a former member of the committee dealing with children's rights chaired by Deputy O'Rourke, I wish to ask about issues which have already been raised, but which are important.  The vetting legislation on the legislative list has already been referred to.  It was said that it is now expected to be published some time in 2011.  The Oireachtas joint committee published a report in September 2008, unanimously recommending that the legislation be published by December 2008.  Why is legislation on a mayor for Dublin being given priority over protecting children from child abuse?  Is it the case that the Government is happy to pay lip service to child protection but is incapable of prioritising the legislative changes necessary to ensure children are truly protected?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I have already explained to a previous Deputy that issues that arise are being discussed by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  That is being handled as a matter of priority.  It is hoped that the Minister of State will be able to bring heads of a Bill to the Government soon.  That is the up-to-date information and any further information should be sought from the line Minister of State.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	445	That is not priority; it is bureaucratic constipation.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I wish to raise two matters.  During the summer period, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform announced the creation of a house price register database.  Has legislation been drafted in this area and when is it expected to be before the House?On the day we broke up for the summer recess, a report was published by a working group investigating mortgage arrears.  The report contained a series of recommendations many of them legislative to deal with the issue that is affecting a minimum of 35,000 households at present.  Will the matter be debated in the House?  Given that the report was published several months ago on the day the House went into recess, can we now get an opportunity to debate the report and its recommendations?  Will there be legislation——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	447	That will be discussed by the Whips.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	449	On the first matter, I do not believe legislation would be required for the establishment of that database, but I am sure the work is ongoing as the Minister has stated.On the second matter, there was an interim report from the group that was set up to look at that issue and some recommendations taken on board.  I understand a further report will emanate from that group in due course.  Of course it is open to the relevant committee to call in the chairperson and members of that group to discuss anything further with them if it wishes.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I call Deputy Reilly.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	451	Given that the Taoiseach has acknowledged that there is no legislative need for the creation of a house price register database——

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	453	A Cheann Comhairle——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The Deputy has had an inquiry about promised legislation and has received an answer.  He will need to find an alternative way to raise it.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	455	When the Dáil goes into summer recess, we have Ministers making announcements outside the House and when we come back to the House in September——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I ask the Deputy for his co-operation.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	457	——we cannot get a response from Ministers to acknowledge the announcements they made several weeks earlier.

When will the database be put in place given that there is now no legislative hindrance on it?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The Deputy should submit a parliamentary question to get the information required.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	466	That is a matter for the Whips in the normal course of their discussions as to how they order the business.  Any requests to deal with those issues are considered in that context.  I said I am not aware of any requirement for legislation on the first matter and it is not on the list.  It is not contemplated that there would be legislation during this session.  If the Deputy has further queries on the legislative side, he should submit a parliamentary question.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	467	Can we take it a Cheann Comhairle——

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	470	It was just a bad news week during the summer when the Minister came out and made the announcement.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Deputy has been advised to raise the matter through his party Whip.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	472	At a time when we are seeing massive health cuts across the country, with waiting lists doubled, people lying on trolleys and nearly 20,000 cancelled operations, can the Taoiseach explain why, when I asked when the drug prescription Bill and the drug reference pricing Bill would come in, he said that they would happen on the one finger when I suggested he was putting them on the long finger?  The drugs prescription legislation has been introduced and it might save €20 million, but it hurts the oldest, sickest and most vulnerable in our society.  The drug reference pricing Bill, which could save hundreds of millions of euro, is now no longer to be taken this year, but some time in 2011.  When will it happen in 2011 and why is it not being taken in this session?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I do not have the information as to when in 2011 it will be taken; that is the estimated time when it will be taken.  The Deputy should refer to Minister concerned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	474	When will the Bill to ban corporate donations come before the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	475	That is a matter for continuing consideration by Cabinet.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Many modified or souped-up vehicles driven on the roads are a danger and have resulted in a number of fatalities and serious injuries.  Has the Government any plans to introduce legislation to ban what are termed as boy-racer vehicles?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I am not aware of any proposals on this matter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I asked the same question today of the Minister for Transport.  I received a reply from the Ceann Comhairle that the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for this matter which is one for the Road Safety Authority.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	482	Trick questions are not allowed.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Since when did responsibility for legislation on this matter transfer to the Road Safety Authority?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	484	We are aware of the provisions of the Constitution on such a matter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	485	How can I receive a reply stating the Minister for Transport has no responsibility for legislation in this area?  What is his responsibility?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The Minister has handed everything else over to quangos.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	487	Hear, hear.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	488	The Deputy should submit a matter for the Adjournment and it can be considered then.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Why did Deputy Costello ask the Taoiseach then when he already got a reply ten minutes ago?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	490	Where would we be without Deputy Martin?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	491	Deputies we must move on.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	493	This is unedifying and gives the public a bad impression of us.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	494	To give an answer like that is contrary to Standing Orders and contradicts the Constitution on ministerial responsibility.  It is wrong.  It is not the responsibility of a quango to deal with legislative matters.  It is just not good enough that Members on this side of the House get these types of reply.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	495	If the Deputy submits the matter for the Adjournment debate, it can be sympathetically considered.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	496	It is not a matter for the Adjournment.  It is a matter concerning legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Deputy can deal with it in that context.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	502	For what?

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	504	It is an issue for the Ceann Comhairle to rectify, not for an answer on the Adjournment.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I have suggested to the Deputy to submit it for consideration.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Will the Ceann Comhairle agree——
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Why is Deputy Costello's microphone switched off?
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	508	——this should be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for determination?  A Minister cannot——

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	510	——withdraw himself from his responsibilities in making legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Deputy, please.  There are so many other ways to pursue this matter.  I have suggested one already.  If he does, we will endeavour to facilitate him.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	512	Will the Ceann Comhairle put this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Will the Deputy resume his seat?  I call on Deputy Seán Power.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Why is the Deputy's microphone switched off?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I support my colleague on this matter.  This issue has been raised on the Order of Business on several occasions over the past few years.  It is getting worse.  The right of a Member to get a reply to a parliamentary question — the traditional way for the Opposition to get information — is now being excluded from the Order Paper.  We are now being told by the Ceann Comhairle to raise it on the Adjournment.  No one comes in to answer the Adjournment debates anymore.  No one cares any more.  The public expects the Ceann Comhairle to preside over a House that is accountable.  We cannot be accountable if we are refused information.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Okay.  I call on Deputy Seán Power.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Before we move on, this has to be clarified.  This is the first day of the new session and a Minister has claimed he is not responsible for a legislative matter.  That is incorrect.  Will the Ceann Comhairle agree that it be put on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	519	If the Deputy makes a written request for it to be considered——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	521	——it will be considered.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	522	In this case, the Minister is not obeying the basic rule of the House, which is to answer a matter dealing with legislation.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	523	There are several options which the Deputy can consider.  If he wishes to submit it for consideration——
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I will submit it to the Ceann Comhairle to be put on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Do so.  I also suggest the Deputy might put it down for the Adjournment.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I must express my satisfaction and appreciation that the issues relating to the RACE apprentice school in Kildare have been resolved and that its courses will resume next week.What progress has been made on legislation for funding the racing industry?  Will the Taoiseach guarantee that this particular legislation will not penalise bookmakers based or licensed in this jurisdiction?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	527	This matter continues to be worked on by the relevant Ministers concerned.  We will take on board the Deputy's points.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	528	In an earlier reply the Taoiseach indicated the Government will allow time tomorrow for a debate on the final figure for Anglo Irish Bank when it is published by the Financial Regulator.  In light of this undertaking, what time does the Taoiseach expect the information to be announced?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I do not have that information to hand.  We can arrange it with the Whips.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Will it be before the markets open or after they close?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The Taoiseach must be expecting it early in the day if he is in a position to tell us we can have a debate on it in the House tomorrow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I was talking to the Minister for Finance when I was replying earlier to Deputy Kenny.  He said we could possibly take it tomorrow.  I will take it up with him again and come back to the Whips.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	533	The Taoiseach knows more about this report than he pretended earlier on.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	535	On the pink list of the Government's legislative programme, there is a proposed Bill to deal with the abolition of the Dormant Accounts Board and to give additional functions to the Minister responsible.  Is this legislation to be preceded by the publication of the final report of the Dormant Accounts Board or does the Minister propose to take function to himself without any transparency?  When are we likely to see the printed version of the legislation?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I am surprised the Taoiseach is searching through his file for this legislation.  This relates to the moneys that were taken over after the Committee of Public Accounts investigation into DIRT and which were scattered up and down the west coast.  It served the Government well so it should know what the story is.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I move the following motions:That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the resignation from Dáil Éireann of George Lee, a Member for the constituency of Dublin South.That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the resignation from Dáil Éireann of Martin Cullen, a Member for the constituency of Waterford.That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the election to the European Parliament of Pat ‘The Cope' Gallagher, a Member for the constituency of Donegal South-West.This is more than a debate about individual constituency vacancies.  By failing to hold these three by-elections, the Government, running scared before the people, is denying democracy not just to the people in the constituencies in question but to the entire electorate.  It is a double standard that offends the very nature of our Irishness, our Republic and the possession of our own democracy.The Government relied on that very same democracy to become the Executive.  Now in power, it denies that same democracy to the people, some of whom voted it into power.  It is the ultimate duplicity by a desperate, terror stricken, power-mad Government too scared of its own people to ask their opinion.  I have listened to the Taoiseach and others speaking about the Government's majority and democracy.  The Government is scared stiff of the electorate and does not want to hold these by-elections because it knows what the result will be.  The Taoiseach is very fond of saying he derives his mandate to govern from the Dáil but he forgets to add that he only retains that mandate by keeping seats vacant, the ultimate perversion of democracy.  The Government is aware that if it agrees to these by-elections, the people will savage it at the polls because they are waiting with anger, apprehension and vengeance.Bunreacht na hÉireann states that Ireland is a sovereign, democratic state, where power derives from its people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State.  At present, however, we have an artificial majority.  The Government had denied people the right to exercise their judgment at this point on the rule of this Government.The Constitution sets out clear population parameters for representation in the Dáil and these parameters have been clearly breached in Donegal South West and Waterford.  The Constitution states that there should be a minimum of one Deputy for every 30,000 people in Ireland.  County Waterford, with three seats out of four occupied, has one TD for every 35,000.  The same holds for Donegal South West, with two seats out of three occupied, one for every 35,000 people.  A vacancy has existed in Donegal for 15 months, more than a quarter of the lifetime of any Dáil.The Government faces a High Court action to force it to hold the Donegal South West by-election.  I am appalled that at a time when 80 families are having their electricity supply cut off every day, the Government sees fit to spend taxpayers' money in the High Court to defend its artificial majority and to give the two fingers to the people of Donegal South West, saying they do not need a by-election and that it can conduct its affairs without them.  It is the ultimate kick in the teeth for the electorate of that constituency.  The costs could rise to €500,000 if the Government appeals any High Court decision to the Supreme Court.I commend Deputy Ó Caoláin's party on having the initiative to take this to the courts.  There have been indications in the media that the Government might set a date for this by-election to take the sting out of situation.  If the Government does that, and fails to name a date for the elections in Dublin South and Waterford, Fine Gael will lodge papers in the High Court to challenge the Government on behalf of the people of these other constituencies.The business of this House is treated with contempt by this Government.  It is denigrated by it.  The House is treated as a forum it does not want to attend at all costs.  That we must go elsewhere to vindicate the democratic rights of the people is sad.  If that is what is needed, however, we will do it.The Government Whip should bear in mind that thousands of people feel lost, confused, fearful and anxious because of its directionless leadership in recent years.  The people in all constituencies are waiting with vengeance for the Government, be it next week, in three months time or in six months time.  If this Government had any courage, it would stand up and say it will go to the country now.  We are asking for a date for these three by-elections.  The Taoiseach knows that if he sets that date, it will precipitate a general election, which will put the Government out of office for ten years because of the failures that have destroyed the country and crushed the spirit of the people.  That is the real reason it is running away from the voters.Two of our three candidates are in place — Senator Coffey in Waterford and Mr. Barry O'Neill in Donegal South-West, with another waiting in the wings in Dublin South, to contest the seat with Deputies Shatter and Mitchell.  I put it to the Government Whip that if he has any courage, gumption or guts, he will stand up and say that we will let the people judge us in Donegal South West, in Dublin South and in Waterford.  He knows the answer.  The Government is comprised of a Cabinet of cowards, who are afraid to face the people in the ultimate test, the ballot box.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The Labour Party supports the three motions proposed by Fine Gael to move the writs for the vacancies in the constituencies of Dublin South, Donegal South West and Waterford.  It is now more than seven months since George Lee resigned as a Member of this House.  Following the death of Séamus Brennan in July 2008, the seat was left unfilled for 11 months.  As a result the people of Dublin South have been under-represented for a combined period of 18 months in the past two years.  It is almost 16 months since Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher was elected to the European Parliament, creating a vacancy for the constituency of Donegal South West.  It is almost seven months since Deputy Martin Cullen resigned, leaving the people of Waterford under-represented.There have been occasions in the past when vacancies have been left unfilled for a considerable period but never before in the history of the State has there been a deliberate policy that each vacancy in the Dáil should be left unfilled for such a prolonged period.  There have been seven separate days since the beginning of 2009 when writs have been moved to fill the vacancies in this House.  On six separate occasions, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, with the support of some independent Members, have combined to defeat these motions.It is not acceptable for vacancies in the membership of this House to be left unfilled for so long.  It is fundamentally undemocratic that the people of Donegal South West, Dublin South and Waterford are being denied the level of representation to which they are entitled under law and under the Constitution.  The message conveyed by the refusal of the Government to allow these by-elections to proceed is that membership of the Dáil is somehow not important, that politics is not important and that the democratic system is not important.  Neither is it good enough for the Government to suggest, as Green Party Ministers have been doing, that the by-elections could be held in March 2011.  That would mean the Donegal South West vacancy would be unfilled for almost two years.  How could that be justified?It is not acceptable for the Government to plead that a decision should not be made on these motions because there is a legal action before the High Court seeking to compel the Government to move the writ for the Donegal South West by-election.  While every citizen has the right to seek redress in the courts, it is more appropriate and desirable that decisions on these matters should be made in the Dáil.  Even if there is a High Court determination in October, it is possible the outcome will be appealed to the Supreme Court, pushing the decision out into the distant future.It is not acceptable that by-elections can be deferred indefinitely simply because the outcome is politically difficult for the Government or because it is afraid of losing them.  In countries with a similar system of parliamentary democracy, by-elections are held within a matter of weeks of the vacancy occurring.  There was a similar practice in the early days of this State.  I have pointed out previously that when Kevin O'Higgins was assassinated on 10 July 1927, the subsequent by-election was held on 24 August.Until the election of this Fianna Fáil-Green Government, the practice generally has been that by-elections were held within a few months of the vacancy occurring.  There were two vacancies during the last Dáil and the by-elections were held within three months.  There were six vacancies in the lifetime of the 28th Dáil, from 1997 to 2002.  On no occasion was the seat left vacant for as long as a year.Given the unprecedented attitude of this Government there is now a strong case for introducing legislation to require a by-election to be held within a specified period, other than in the case of some emergency situation where deferral should require a vote of perhaps two-thirds of the Dáil.  Whatever excuses the Minister will come up with in replying to this debate, we know the real reason why the Government will do anything to further delay the by-elections.  It is that the Government parties know they are facing defeats in all three constituencies.  Is it any wonder that is so?  Fianna Fáil's toxic combination of recklessness and incompetence has driven the country into the worst recession in our history and probably the worst recession of any developed country.Under Fianna Fáil this country was first into recession and if Fianna Fáil is allowed to cling to office we will be the last country out of recession.  Tomorrow the people will learn, we are told, of the likely full cost of the Government's bailout of Anglo Irish Bank.  The best we can hope is that it will not exceed €30 billion.  That is more than €6,700 for every man, woman and child in the country.  The financial millstone which has been placed around the necks of successive generations of Irish taxpayers is a direct result of the disastrous blanket guarantee introduced by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in September 2008.Exactly two years ago the Labour Party stood in this House in opposition to that blanket guarantee.  The Labour Party stance has been vindicated by everything that has happened in the past two years.  Every forecast the Government made at that time has proved to be wrong.  Far from being the cheapest bank bailout in the world, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, claimed, it has become by far the most expensive.One direct consequence of the open-ended and unlimited nature of the guarantee and the still unquantified cost to the taxpayer has been the cost of borrowing on the international money markets, which has increased to a point where Ireland now ranks below Greece in terms of the rates that must be paid.  For the past two years Fianna Fáil has been mesmerised by the consequences of the disastrous blanket bank guarantee and has allowed rates of unemployment and emigration to return to levels the people of this country hoped they would never see again.This Government is crippled beyond repair.  It is demoralised and politically dishevelled.  The longer it clings to power the more damage it will do.  It should face the inevitable and go to the people.

In repeatedly refusing to hold these by-elections the Government is clearly acting without a mandate and is denying democracy to the people of three constituencies and to the people of the State as a whole.This Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government has no mandate for its savage cuts to public services, no mandate for the bank bailout and no mandate for NAMA.  Fianna Fáil was elected on the basis of the lie that its economic policies would prolong the Celtic tiger era and that the property madness would end not in a crash but in a soft landing.  The Green Party was elected on the basis that it would lead the Irish people into the promised eco-friendly land of political purity.  Instead, where did it go?  It led them into bed with Fianna Fáil.  How far from political purity can one get?There was much attention three weeks ago on the Taoiseach's state of health on a particular morning.  I am pleased to note it is good today.  However, politically there is no doubt that he and his Government are staggering and reeling and their days are numbered.  A few days after the now internationally famous radio interview the Taoiseach said dismissively that the Donegal South-West by-election would take place some time in 2011.  My party colleague, Sinn Féin Senator Pearse Doherty, rightly described the Taoiseach's comment as an insult to the people of Donegal.  It is now nearly 16 months or, to be precise, 482 days since this seat became vacant and the Government has blocked every attempt to hold a by-election.Senator Doherty has taken this Government to the High Court to try to ensure that it accords to the people of Donegal South-West their right to full representation. The people of Dublin South and Waterford have the same right and we call for the holding of the three by-elections this autumn.  One of the major flaws in the Constitution is that it has no provision for by-elections to be held within a reasonable time of the vacancy arising.  Instead the power is in the hands of the Government of the day and can be delayed indefinitely according as the political expediency of the Government demands.  It is another abuse of democratic principles that serves to increase people's disillusion and cynicism about politics.These motions come before us on the day figures confirm that there are over 440,000 people unemployed in this State.  Make no mistake about it, the Government can take no credit or comfort from the fact that there were 5,400 fewer people signing on in September than there were in August.  That shows the only one success from the Government's range of policies, limited though they are, namely, the policy of emigration.  Emigration is rampant and our graduates are looking abroad for meaningful employment because this is one of the few states in western Europe trying to get out of recession without an economic stimulus package.  It is emigration that is the real cause of the reduction in the figures announced today.Emigration is nothing new to the people of County Donegal.  Under landlordism and British rule, under the Free State and even under the Celtic tiger the county suffered higher than average unemployment, Government neglect and the forced emigration of its young people decade after decade.  Waterford has suffered the loss of long-standing quality industries, including Waterford Glass, a national flagship enterprise that should never have been allowed to close.  Dublin South, like the rest of our capital, has a high number of young unemployed people.There are 440,000 jobless people and hundreds of thousands of others struggling on low to medium incomes who are paying for the Fianna Fáil binge of the past 13 years when their Government, in league with corrupt developers and bankers, inflated the property bubble, leading to the economic crash and the current recession.  Fianna Fáil may try to deny its responsibility for the social and economic mess in this State but it and everyone else knows that it cannot shirk that responsibility and that it will pay dearly for it in all of the by-elections when they take place, or a general election, whether it takes place before or after the by-elections.The question is how much more damage will it do to Irish society and the Irish economy before it is thrown out of office.  The Fianna Fáil and Green Party coalition response to the recession has been as fundamentally flawed as the mismanagement that led to the recession in the first place.  They have kept it in place and now want to extend a bank guarantee which is costing the taxpayer dearly, demands little accountability from the banks and allows them to continue to exploit customers with excessive interest rates, massive mortgage debt and a credit famine for viable businesses.Sinn Féin's opposition to the legislation which set the terms of the bank guarantee has been vindicated.  Not only is this Government leaving us the toxic legacy of the recession, it is also leaving us the toxic legacy of its criminally incompetent response to the recession.  This is having a real, damaging and lasting impact on people's lives and each of the 440,000 people who are unemployed are real people, not statistics.In education Government cuts mean dilapidated schools, larger classes and the neglect of special needs.  In health the cuts mean longer waiting lists, cancelled operations, more people on trolleys and chairs in accident and emergency units and hospital services closed down.  If the recruitment ban in the public health service is maintained over the next three years a further 6,000 front line posts will remain unfilled.  This Government has clearly bred disgust and disillusionment with politics and it is hoping that people have their heads down and will accept the forthcoming savage budget it has heralded with little protest.However, people have become politicised and will not accept it lying down.   That was demonstrated outside the gates of this House today in a significant mobilisation of support against the approach of this Government.  For our part, we in Sinn Féin will be stepping up our campaigning work culminating in a pre-budget rally against cuts here in this city on Saturday, 4 December.If the Government is prepared to stand over its savage cuts, let it face the people in the three by-elections, and it should face them this autumn.  It should set the date here this evening, face the people and let the people in the three by-election constituencies have the opportunity to pass judgment on its stewardship.  That will be a clear barometer for what is awaiting it when the general election comes sooner, hopefully, rather than later.

While the Government fully recognises the entitlement of citizens to full representation, it is important to point out the various misrepresentations by the parties opposite of the actual facts of the position.People on the Opposition benches are often quick to point across the Irish Sea on how by-elections are dealt with there and on the need for us to copy their system to ensure full parliamentary representation. One point that is conveniently or mistakenly forgotten by those parties is that our political system operates on a multi-seat basis.  It is not the same system as that operated in the United Kingdom where there is only one elected representative per constituency.I recognise that the optimum is to have each seat in each constituency filled but it is wrong to suggest that people do not have representation and are not represented in this House.  Placing such a slant on this issue merely serves to denigrate to a certain extent the body politic and the hard work of Deputies such as Deputies Brendan Kenneally, John Deasy, Brian O'Shea, Tom Kitt, Olivia Mitchell, Eamon Ryan, Alan Shatter, Dinny McGinley and the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan.

Nobody in this House needs to be reminded of the severe economic and fiscal challenges we face.  I draw the attention of Deputies to the editorial comment in one of the national newspapers today which states that the Members of the Dáil face a challenge none of their living predecessors had to consider.We are living in economically turbulent times.  That is the case here in Ireland and throughout much of the rest of the world.  In this House we must plot a course which puts Ireland on the road to a sustained economic recovery.  Too often, the Government is accused of running scared and not facing the challenges.  The opposite is the case when it comes to the challenges this country is now facing.  This Government is confronting economic challenges in terms of fiscal and banking policy, which may not have been as critical or stark at any stage in our history.  As an elected representative in this House and as an ordinary Irish citizen I truly wish that the Opposition could for one moment cease the politics as usual and the endless point scoring and ditch what appears to be an endless negativity that seems to colour all public comment.I am not suggesting that the members of the Opposition should cease to hold the Government to account but I would ask for a new maturity in terms of their engagement with Government to confront the economic challenges.  I would ask for a moment's reflection on the role the Opposition can play in building our national recovery and not on the way the next political point can be scored against the Government.

In this regard I welcome this morning's positive live register figures which I hope are an indication that rising unemployment has been halted.

We believe that to take our eye off the ball in terms of economic recovery to canvass and contest the elections would not be welcomed by the people.

I understand that once that has taken place, under the Electoral Act the vote must be held between 18 and 25 days after the day on which the writ is issued.  That is the intention of the Government, and I hope it brings a greater clarity to the matter for Deputies.It would be remiss not to make reference in my contribution to the upcoming case brought by Senator Doherty.  In broad terms, the Government is of the view that the fact that the Donegal South West by-election has not been held to date does not give rise to a violation of the Constitution.  Article 17.7 of the Constitution provides that "...elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall be regulated in accordance with law".  The relevant law is section 39(2) of the Electoral Act 1992, which provides that the Ceann Comhairle shall direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue a writ to the relevant constituency as soon as he is directed to do so by the Dáil.It is Senator Doherty, and not the Government, who has brought the matter into the court.  Now that this has occurred, the Government must defend the case because the case gives rise to extremely important constitutional issues concerning the separation of powers.  Regardless of the way the case is decided, it will give rise to an important precedent.I am aware that the proceedings in Senator Doherty's case will take place in public and will be heard on 18 October.  However, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt that judicial process by going into any further detail on the arguments that counsel for the Government will make.I hope this sets out clearly and succinctly the side of the Government on this important issue.  It is in this context that the Government will be voting against the motions brought forward by Fine Gael this evening.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the draft scheme entitled Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010, a copy of which draft scheme was laid before Dáil Éireann on 23 September 2010.The draft statutory instrument entitled the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) Scheme 2010 amends the bank guarantee scheme, known as the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme or ELG scheme, which was introduced in December 2009.  Consequently, the scheme before Members is not a new one.  It is, however, different from the original guarantee, that is, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme introduced this time two years ago.  That scheme was supported by the vast majority of this House and  provided for a blanket guarantee of the deposits and liabilities of Irish institutions by the Government in the face of clear and present danger to the financial stability of the State at that time.It is a source of bewilderment that the brave decision to introduce the original guarantee, supported by the vast majority in this House, is now being characterised by some as the root of all our problems.  Let me be clear: had that guarantee not been introduced, we would not now have an economy, never mind a banking system.  On that night two years ago, our banking system was perched on a on precipice.  Funding had all but dried up and the banks faced closure within days.  Anyone who doubts that has not read the report of the Governor of the Central Bank.  In the first chapter referring to the discussions that took place on the night of 29 September, Professor Honohan states:[I]t is hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place, since all participants (rightly) felt that they faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive immediate action.  Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society.  There would have been additional lost income and employment surely amounting, if it could be quantified, to tens of billions of euros.Professor Honohan went on to criticise the inclusion of dated subordinated debt in the guarantee, and the scheme before Members this evening excludes this category.  However, on the night of 29 September, there simply was too much at stake to discriminate between different types of bondholders and in the end, those whom the Governor felt should not have been included accounted for just 3% of the covered liabilities.  Furthermore, a number of covered institutions have engaged in liability management exercises in respect of their subordinated debt.  In other words, in plain language, subordinated bondholders have been forced to take losses in these institutions.Members also should be clear that the Labour Party did not simply quibble, as its Members would like to portray it, with the blanket nature of the guarantee.  They opposed it tooth and nail and in its entire substance.  As it moves to the centre ground of Irish politics in its bid to be all things to all voters, it is as well for everyone to stop and think where this economy would now be had that party been in the driving seat this time two years ago.  There is no doubt but that we are in stormy waters.  We weathered a tsunami of international financial collapse two years ago and we will come through this storm also.The scheme before us this evening is a more focused and targeted scheme than the original guarantee scheme and it is in line with the European model of bank guarantees that was developed in its wake.  This scheme no longer covers subordinated debt and it imposes significantly higher fees on participating institutions for the benefit of a State guarantee of their liabilities.  According to the latest data available to my Department, at the end of June 2010 bank liabilities covered under the ELG scheme stood at €153 billion.The serious challenges that continue to face the Irish banking system demand that the State underpin through guarantee mechanisms the funding position of our domestic institutions.   The original guarantee provided a necessary and vital support to our banking system as other measures to repair and renew the system have been introduced.  The Government's guiding principle in all its interventions since September 2008 has been to provide a financial system that will serve our industry, businesses and households.  In doing this, we are safeguarding the lifeblood of our economy, the engine that keeps people in jobs and that will create jobs for our young people coming into the workforce.  No vested interest has influenced the Government's actions.  Our sole motivation is the common good.The actions we have taken since September 2008, in particular the establishment of NAMA and the recapitalisations, allow us to plan gradually to phase out the extent to which guarantee arrangements are available.  That process begun with the introduction of the ELG scheme last December and the expiry of the original guarantee scheme from midnight tonight.  However, the inherent weaknesses in our banking system have meant that the phasing out process must be measured, incremental and responsible.The ELG scheme which has been running in tandem with the original guarantee since last December has enabled the banks to issue longer-term debt so as to improve their funding profile.  For this facility, the banks have been charged a higher fee.  It has been suggested by some commentators that the covered institutions have benefited from a low-cost guarantee from the State.  In fact, since September 2008 the banks have contributed over €1 billion in fees.  This extension of the guarantee will impose a further increase in fees on the institutions involved.  Our objective is to incentivise the banks to lengthen the term of their funding and to lessen their reliance on State guarantees.Ireland has not been alone in providing this form of support for institutions.  We were the first to introduce a guarantee but we were quickly followed by other member states in the European Union.  About a dozen other EU countries — for example, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Spain and Sweden — have extended their guarantees until the 31 December.  The European Commission recently estimated that crisis measures put forward by EU member states have been approved under State aid rules to an overall maximum volume of €4.1 trillion and guarantees accounted for over 75% of that volume.The argument has frequently been made that Anglo Irish Bank should have been excluded from the guarantee.  Let us return to the Governor's report.  He stated, "Anglo was clearly systemically important in the prevailing conditions at the end of September 2008".  He also stated, "There can be little doubt that a disorderly failure of Anglo would, in the absence of any other protective action, have had a devastating effect on the remainder of the Irish banks".  The Governor went on to explore the option of excluding Anglo Irish Bank from the guarantee.  He concluded that it would have been what he describes as a "second Lehmans", which would have had "a destabilising spill-over effect" on the entire European banking system.What we have been through is an unprecedented global financial crisis.  Markets worldwide have been in uncharted territory for the past two years.  This has forced the hands of Governments all over the world, and that of Ireland is no exception.  No country is fully out of the woods yet.  The cost has yet to be reckoned in many countries.  However, we have faced up to our problems.  Tomorrow, the Regulator will announce the final cost of Anglo, our most troubled institution.  That is much further than many other countries have travelled.  As The Economist stated recently, “Ireland is paying for its decision to set up a toxic-loan repository that forces banks to clean up their balance-sheets vigorously, rather than put off dealing with problems (as Germany has done) or insure dodgy loans and just hope they improve (as Britain has).”  These are the words of The Economist, not mine, and I am not expressly confirming them as my opinion.We have also taken action to reform our system of regulation.  The Government's appointment of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank and Mr. Matthew Elderfield as Financial Regulator has been welcomed by all and will renew the credibility of our regulatory regime at home and abroad.  I have decided to appoint five members to the Central Bank Commission, which is the unitary board that holds responsibility for the management and control of the Central Bank's activities and functions.  The members I am appointing are Mr. Max Watson, Professor John FitzGerald, Mr. Des Geraghty, Mr. Michael Soden and Professor Blanaid Clarke.The new commission members bring a wealth and diversity of knowledge to their work at the Central Bank, from the areas of economics, financial services, social policy, corporate governance and law.  The new members will serve alongside the Central Bank Commission's ex officio members, who include Governor Patrick Honohan, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, head of financial regulation, Mr. Tony Grimes, head of central banking, and Mr. Kevin Cardiff, Secretary General of the Department of Finance.The Central Bank Reform Act 2010 will be commenced this Friday, 1 October.  Commencement of the Act will bring into being the reconstituted Central Bank and will give effect to the dissolution of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  I wish the Central Bank Commission every success in tackling the vitally important tasks ahead and I thank its outgoing members for their services.Turning specifically to the draft statutory instrument before the House, this statutory instrument proposes to amend the ELG scheme and under the Credit Institutions Financial Support Act 2008 requires the approval of both Houses in order to do so.  The ELG scheme was commenced in December 2009 following Oireachtas approval and allows the banks and building societies that joined it thereafter to accept all deposits and issue short-term and long-term debt on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.  Institutions can issue debt and take deposits under the ELG scheme with a maturity of up to five years, but these liabilities must be incurred within a limited issuance window or period that currently runs to midnight tonight, 29 September.This draft amending statutory instrument proposes to extend the issuance period under the ELG scheme so that it will now run from tomorrow, 30 September, to 31 December 2010.  Many other European countries have sought and obtained extensions in respect of their guarantee schemes.In this draft amending statutory instrument, the opportunity has also been taken in consultation with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to rationalise and update the drafting of some provisions of the scheme.  However, the only substantive amendment made by the statutory instrument is the extension of the issuance window to 31 December 2010.Market conditions have been quite challenging in recent months for banks internationally and those for Irish banks have been no exception.  The extension of the ELG scheme has been recommended to me by the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  EU state aid approval has recently been granted for the extension of the issuance period under the ELG scheme to 31 December 2010 for all eligible liabilities under the scheme.  This full extension to the ELG scheme will help underpin financial stability and enable the institutions to continue to access funding and in turn support lending to the economy.  The ECB has also endorsed the extension of the scheme.  The statutory instrument which I am now presenting to the House gives legal effect to this time extension to the guarantee.I want to deal briefly with the key terms of the ELG scheme and provide some more detail on the terms of the amending statutory instrument.  The scheme was commenced on 9 December 2009 and the six participating institutions and their subsidiaries joined it on various dates in January and February 2010.  Any new debt or deposits incurred or rolled over after the date the institution joined the scheme are guaranteed under the ELG scheme.The institutions that joined the scheme and are thus "participating institutions" are Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, EBS Building Society, Irish Life & Permanent and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Their relevant subsidiaries also joined and are listed fully on the Department's website.Liabilities that may be guaranteed under the ELG scheme, or "eligible liabilities", as they are known, are deposits, senior unsecured certificates of deposit, senior unsecured commercial paper, other senior unsecured bonds and notes, and other forms of senior unsecured debt specified by the Minister and approved by the EU Commission.  There is no change in the draft amending statutory instrument to the range of eligible liabilities.In regard to deposits in particular, all deposits are guaranteed under the ELG scheme.  Retail, corporate and interbank deposits of any duration up to five years are now guaranteed for the full term of the deposit if placed before 31 December with a participating institution.  On-demand deposits with the participating institutions are guaranteed under the terms of the amending statutory instrument to 31 December 2010.If a deposit of up to €100,000 is covered under the EC deposit guarantee scheme, it is not also covered under the ELG scheme.  The ELG scheme covers the excess over €100,000 or any deposit that does not qualify for protection under the 1995 deposit guarantee scheme which continues to apply, is not subject to any end date and continues indefinitely.  A quarterly fee is payable to the Exchequer by the banks for the benefit of having liabilities guaranteed under the ELG scheme.  The original fees associated with the scheme when it was introduced in December 2009 were based on the pricing recommendations published by the European Central Bank in respect of guarantees of this nature and were consistent with the fees applicable for similar guarantees provided by other European Union states in respect of their credit institutions.  They represented a significant increase in the fee applicable under the CIF scheme.The European Central Bank pricing recommendations provide that the fee for debt and deposits with a maturity of one year or less will be 50 basis points per annum.  The corresponding fee for maturities exceeding one year will be based on the median value of the bank's five year CDS spreads for a sample period, plus 50 basis points.  Under European Commission requirements, the fees that institutions are required to pay under the ELG scheme increased for guaranteed liabilities incurred from 1 July.  The additional pricing ranges between 20 and 40 basis points depending on the rating of the institution concerned.Furthermore, additional pricing will apply under the new scheme from 30 September for very short-term debt and short-term corporate and inter-bank deposits, that is, debt and deposits of 90 day or less, excluding retail deposits.  The fees on these liabilities will be increased by 70 basis points by year end.  The real effect of these changes to the pricing regime is that the average fee now paid by institutions under the ELG scheme has increased some 11 times on the average fee paid by institutions under the original bank guarantee scheme when it was introduced in September 2008.  The pricing is set out in the rules to the scheme.As at the end of August €730 million was collected from the institutions in respect of fees for the original scheme and €296 million was collected in respect of fees from the ELG scheme.  Therefore, the State has already reached its €1 billion target for guarantee fees in less than two years.  It is worth noting that no fee is payable in respect of collateral provided by the European Central Bank.  This accounts for the somewhat smaller amount received than was projected under the original guarantee.The ELG scheme provides for the same reporting and information requirements and restrictions on commercial conduct which are set out under the CIF scheme.  The scheme provides the Minister with the power to issue such directions to an institution as are necessary to ensure that the objectives of the Act and the scheme are being met.  The operation of the scheme is delegated to the NTMA.  Given its market expertise, that body is best placed to perform the operational role of scheme operator.  The extension of the issuance period of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme to 31 December 2010 will continue to allow institutions to access funding, both short-term and longer-term debt.  The scheme, as amended, will help maintain the overall stability of the banking sector and complement the broad Government strategy to restore the banking system fully and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.I have heard Deputy Noonan raise doubts about the Government's state of knowledge in regard to the solvency of banks on the night the original guarantee was introduced.  I want to be helpful to the Deputy but must point out that any objective reading of the report prepared by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, of the events leading up to our decision to provide the original guarantee at the end of September 2008 confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Government's advice was that the Irish banking system, and Anglo Irish Bank in particular, was faced with a liquidity crisis.  There was no advice or information provided to Government throughout all of that period that Anglo Irish Bank was facing the huge losses on its loan book that have subsequently come to light thanks to the work of NAMA.  The bank guarantee was provided on the basis that the Irish banking system required State support to underpin its funding position in international markets.  There was no evidence presented to Government that Anglo Irish Bank faced the serious challenges to its solvency which have subsequently required the Government to provide exceptional levels of capital support.

Markets are currently dislocated.  The EU state aid rules provide that the guarantee can be extended for a maximum of six months on each occasion.  We will revisit the requirement for an ELG scheme in consultation with the European Commission and the European Central Bank in advance of the current deadline of 31 December 2010 and will judge the need for an extension on the basis of market conditions at that time and the specific funding position of the Irish institutions having full regard to financial stability matters generally.None of the decisions taken during this crisis has been easy, but we have acted swiftly.  It is imperative that the House is fully aware of the consequences of not approving this scheme.  The Irish banking system continues to experience significant pressures in regard to its funding requirements.  These pressures have intensified in recent weeks as market sentiment toward Ireland has become more negative, reflecting concerns about the scale of the losses in our banking system and significant imbalances in our fiscal position.  The State guarantee for bank liabilities provided under the ELG scheme, which the Government has put forward for approval by the Oireachtas this evening, continues to provide very significant support for the funding of the banking system.  If the scheme is not extended to the end of the year then make no mistake, we will be faced tomorrow with difficulties in funding which will jeopardise the financial stability of the State.  That is the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank and the regulator who both strongly endorse the need to extend this scheme to safeguard the stability of the system and the overall economy.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I believe an extension of the ELG scheme is necessary to ensure the refinancing of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks may proceed in an orderly fashion, that deposits are underpinned elsewhere in the market and that other institutions that wish to avail of the guarantee are free to do so.  I am reluctant to support the motion, however, for two reasons, as dealt with in my amendment.  When the CIF guarantee was introduced two years ago, Fine Gael supported the proposal of the Minister for Finance.  It was our view that a guarantee was necessary in the interests of a functioning banking system, the general economy and in the national interest.  However, we are of the view that we were misled by the Minister, and before we support the motion tonight, we must have an assurance from the Minister that he is providing us with the full facts at his disposal and that we are not again being misled.In the course of the debate in 2008 I asked the Minister for Finance whether he was seeking the guarantee to deal with a liquidity crisis within the banking system or if there was also a solvency crisis.  I spoke at some length during that debate and outlined my concern in some detail. The Minister in his reply assured me that the guarantee was necessary to deal only with a liquidity problem in the banks.  It was clear within a couple of weeks there was a major solvency problem in the banks despite the Minister's assurances in the House to the contrary and, on that basis, Fine Gael voted for the guarantee.  It is possible the Minister was misled and was not aware of the full facts regarding the banks when he proposed the guarantee to the House.  This has been the Minister's defence since the full facts emerged, namely, that he was not aware of the full facts; that the banks had been economical with the truth; and that he was sorry he had misled the House but it was unintentional.  That may be so and what has happened over the years gives credence to the Minister's explanation.It was the current Minister for Finance who stated in this House when Anglo Irish Bank was being nationalised that the total exposure of the taxpayer would be €4.5 billion.  I do not know what the current figure is but yesterday, it was €24 billion and rising with a further instalment to be added.  I do not believe the Minister made up the figure he gave us and as such he must have received bad figures from the bank, the Financial Regulator and the Governor.

That is what he said on the clip shown on "Prime Time".  I do not know in the context of what debate the Minister said it.The Minister, on leaving the House on the night of the guarantee two years ago, went to the Seanad where Senator Liam Twomey moved an amendment to the motion seeking that a cap of €10 billion be put on the total cost of the guarantee.  The Minister in reply stated that he would be amazed if the final figure was anything near that amount.  In his contribution tonight, the Minister stated that €153 billion has been the outlay over the two years.  I am inclined to believe the Minister was misled.New information recently emerged through the release of information to the Committee of Public Accounts.  This information is I believe relevant to the issue before us.  It is important information.  We are told in the documents that a couple of days before the guarantee was introduced in this House, Anglo Irish Bank asked the Bank of Ireland to take it over lock, stock and barrel because it was broke and could not cover its liabilities.  In other words, it was insolvent.  It is hard for us on this side of the House to believe that four days afterwards the Minister was able to come in here and say the problem was one of liquidity and not insolvency.  One would think the Governor of the Central Bank, Financial Regulator or officials in the Department of Finance would have heard either directly on the grapevine that Anglo Irish Bank was selling itself around the town to any bank who might buy it.

The Minister needs to clarify this matter on the record of the House.  How is it that the Minister for Finance did not know four days prior to the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme that Anglo Irish Bank was selling itself, lock, stock and barrel, to Bank of Ireland.  The Minister gave assurances in this House that only issues of liquidity and not insolvency had arisen, thus encouraging Fine Gael to vote for the guarantee.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I find it hard to believe that all these baddies would not have been aware of that on the night of the introduction of the guarantee.  I have always said that if the Minister gives absolute assurances on the record of the House I will take his word.  Against that background, I find it hard to believe.If the Minister wants Fine Gael's support tonight he will have to explain how all this happened and how it is he did not know Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent.  He will have to answer our questions in detail.  We, on this side of the House, are no longer buying pigs in pokes.  I require two further assurances.  All over Europe, Parliaments are moving to enact bank resolution legislation that gives central banks new powers to wind down or break up failing banks in a way that fairly shares the cost with all professional providers of capital and long-term funding.  When banks failed here and in other jurisdictions, central banks found that they did not have a statutory policy instrument that enabled them to intervene to wind down or break up failing banks.  There was no equivalent to appointing a receiver to a commercial company.  The central banks did not have that power.As a condition of supporting this motion, Fine Gael needs a commitment that the Minister will introduce by 1 November 2010 legislation along the lines proposed, as is being done all over Europe.  We also need a commitment that the Government will require Anglo Irish Bank to reach a negotiated settlement with subordinate bond holders so that the burden on the taxpayer may be eased.  I do not foresee a problem in that regard.  Anglo Irish Bank under the chairmanship of Mr. Alan Dukes has been doing deals with subordinate bond holders and has improved the bank's balance sheet.  As I understand it, the guarantee only covered subordinated debt that was dated.  Open-ended subordinate debt was not covered.  The secondary market is selling off some of this debt at 17 cent in the euro.  I cannot foresee any difficulty of dealing straight up with the subordinate debt.There are many questions about the extended guarantee which need to be explored.  The Minister's officials briefed the Opposition finance spokespersons on the special instrument this morning.  However, the briefing did not go much beyond what one would glean from a press release.  The information was helpful and the officials clarified a great deal for me and spared me a great deal of reading.  It is much faster to be briefed across the table.  When issues of detail were raised the Minister's officials appeared to be prohibited from answering either because of considerations of commercial sensitivity or because of a directive from him.

We need further information and all the details.  We got further information later for which I thank the Minister's officials.  As I stated, much of the information we required is, we were told, commercially sensitive and cannot be released.  We could not get information in regard to the NTMA, which is running the scheme.  If the Minister expects us to support the motion, he will need to give us the details.  We cannot vote blindly tonight.I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Perhaps he will outline his view of the banking situation going forward.  Will he need to extend the guarantee again to March 2011?  What are the Minister's expectations in that regard?  Is it intended that the schedule of increasing charges will wean the banks off the guarantee by the end of the year or does the Minister envisage the need for a further extension?   Will Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland be fully capitalised by Christmas?  How long will the wind down of Anglo Irish Bank take?  When will credit again flow in the economy?  When will the EBS, in respect of which there are four bidders, be sold and will this be the first step in establishing a new high street bank, which will be a type of development bank run in the private sector?  Will it be left to the incoming Government to put this in place or will the EBS be run as a building society?  We need answers to these issues, which are serious policy concerns in respect of which the Government is silent.How long will it take before the directors of banks, on whose watch the crisis developed, are replaced?  When I raised this issue six months ago, the Minister in reply stated he agreed with me that these directors who were asleep on their watch, even though not personally culpable, would be replaced.  As far as I am aware, none have been replaced.

Why is this the case given the huge stake the Irish taxpayer has taken in these banks?  Such people have been shown the door everywhere else.  I am not suggesting these people are personally responsible but what happened on their watch and they should be replaced.  When can we expect the Director of Corporate Affairs to report on his inquiry into the banks?  When will the Garda send a file arising out of its investigations to the DPP?  It was announced in January 2009 that the Garda Commissioner was sending in members of the fraud squad to Anglo Irish Bank.  While that is not quite two years ago, it is close enough.  The only thing I have heard on the matter since was the dawn raid on Seán FitzPatrick's house in Greystones in the week before the Minister introduced the National Asset Management Agency legislation in the House.  That action appeared to be more about providing Vaseline to ease the progress of the Bill through the House than making a serious attempt to investigate what was taking place.These are the questions people are asking.  On the night after the raid in Greystones, the Garda Commissioner stated on television that a file was being prepared to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Given that business is being done reasonably quickly everywhere else, it is fair to ask when the Garda file will be sent to the DPP.While many countries are experiencing a banking crisis, most have taken action and moved on and those guilty of malpractice have been made answerable to the law.  The United States is a good example because the authorities, having rolled in at the close of the markets at 4 p.m. on Friday, worked day and night on the following Saturday and Sunday and had put in place a solution before the markets reopened at 8 a.m. the following Monday.  This occurred right across the investment banks of New York.  They made a mistake, however, in allowing Lehman Brothers to fail.I need answers to the questions I have put.  I hope the Minister will be able to provide strong assurances, without quibble, because while the Fine Gael Party agrees the extension is necessary for the reasons I have outlined, we are disposed to vote against the motion, particularly given that I cannot press my amendment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I agree that a guarantee is necessary and concur with the Minister that other countries are also extending guarantees.  The difference between Ireland and other countries, however, is that the end is in sight in the latter, whereas in Ireland no progress has been made and no end is in sight.  If one compares Ireland with Britain, where the authorities nationalised and recapitalised the banks, one sees that UK banks are already turning a profit for British taxpayers.  Two years and billions of euro later, however, Ireland has dysfunctional banks with no sign of an improvement and no credit in the economy.  As a result, unemployment has more than doubled since the employment peak whereas in Britain it has increased by a mere 1.2% from peak employment in 2007.  This very different outcome for Ireland is primarily a result of the calamitous decision in respect of the blanket guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank.The Government's decisions on Anglo Irish Bank might have been justified if, as we were informed at the time, the problem was one of liquidity.  In fact, the problem was one of solvency or, rather, insolvency and we still do not know the full extent of Anglo Irish Bank's insolvency 24 months and billions of euro later.  The Government's decisions are directly responsible for the downward spiral in which we find ourselves.  We have learned that the Government was probably in possession of the relevant information on the night the guarantee was provided.  If the Minister was not in possession of this information, the banks clearly ran rings around him on the night in question.  Within weeks of the decision on the guarantee, everyone knew precisely what was the position and that Anglo Irish Bank was an insolvent, zombie institution.  If the Fine Gael Party proposal for an orderly wind down had been adopted, Ireland, like many other countries in Europe, would be experiencing economic recovery.To the extent that this financial amendment ends the guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank debt acquired prior to the guarantee date of September 2008, it is welcome in that it provides for an option to renegotiate the subordinated debt.  It is a tragedy, however, that it has taken two years of pouring money into a black hole to the realise the folly of supporting a zombie bank.  If the Minister were present, he would probably be able to inform the House that now that the guarantee is gone, Anglo Irish Bank will be immediately mandated to negotiate a buy-out for outstanding subordinated debt and try to make some saving for taxpayers.  As I stated, it is tragedy that this has come so late.How much of the debt acquired prior to September 2008 matured in the two years that have passed and was redeemed at full face value?  Was the figure €10 billion, €12 billion or €15 billion?  How much was spent recapitalising Anglo Irish Bank as if it would ever operate again as a functioning bank?  The waste of money is particularly acute given the policy changes the Minister announced recently in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.Billions of euro could have been saved and Ireland would not be a nation on the brink of economic disaster if the Government had listened to Fine Gael two years ago or at any time since it was realised that Government decisions were not working and were dragging the country down.  However, to listen would have required admitting it was wrong, which this Government never does.  Instead, it blames the markets, rating agencies, Opposition and media, all of which are accused, to use the Minister's phrase, of causing "unremitting gloom" and reputational damage to Ireland.  What a joke.  The Government need not have any fear on that score because that boat has long since sailed.  The international media and markets know precisely what is taking place in Ireland and look on mesmerised at the Government's willingness to inflict limitless pain on Irish people to support a policy position on Anglo Irish Bank that the whole world knows is wrong.Making mistakes is one thing — God knows Government policy on Anglo Irish Bank was a monumental mistake — but not learning from them is unforgivable.  Continuing to dig a hole, as the Government has done for the past two years, and ignoring what the entire world and what this side of the House have stated repeatedly is unforgivable folly.  Giving total protection to professional investors in a high flying bank such as Anglo Irish Bank was in the past and paying for it out of the pockets of our children and grandchildren has been the deliberate policy of this Government.  After 24 months, our banks are still not functioning.  We do not know what will be the final cost or whether we will ever get out of the hole the Government has dug for us.Earlier, the Taoiseach was at pains to explain that the interest on the money borrowed for Anglo Irish Bank was very low — insignificant almost.  This borrowing is bleeding the country dry when the money should be spent on capital projects to revitalise the economy and create badly needed jobs.  The narrow options available to the Government to introduce any kind of jobs plan was demonstrated yesterday by a jobs plan that consisted solely of setting up another quango.  I plead with the Minister to ensure the questions asked in this debate by Deputy Noonan, me and other Members are answered because, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, we are not of a mind to buy a pig in a poke again.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Even the most pessimistic observer could not have foreseen just how calamitous a decision the 2008 bank guarantee has turned out to be.  The date of 29 September 2008 is as steeped in infamy in Ireland's history as Pearl Harbour was for the generation of Americans led by President Franklin Roosevelt.I propose to outline one case.  Professor Morgan Kelly was attacked with vitriol by the Minister for Finance in this House in January 2009 for daring to suggest that the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank could cost the taxpayer as much as €15 billion.  What innocent days we had barely 21 months ago.  If only the cost of Anglo Irish Bank could have been confined to €15 billion.  What was shocking then has turned out to be a trifle.  Professor Kelly, who was excoriated in public and private, can hold his head high today whereas the reputations of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, have been shredded as umpteen billions are carted into the Anglo Irish incinerator, notwithstanding their vulgar promises to Irish people that their policy would be the cheapest bank bailout in history.  The Taoiseach and Minister hate to be reminded of that example of pure hubris or of the promise that Ireland, the first country into recession, would be the first out of recession, one more example of the triumph of vanity politics over reason and experience.Today, the Minister for Finance has to look back on that fateful night of two years ago and see the complete bonfire of the vanity he displayed that week.  Charitably he may be given a high score for sincerity and effort but I am afraid a hopeless score for political and economic judgment.  Were he a general in a war, whether at the Somme or Iwo Jima, there would be nobody left alive.If the only price to be paid was the political reputation of these two Brians, we could shrug it off but alas, the price of their flawed judgment on that day and in the months and years prior to it has turned out to be astronomical and has left a bitter legacy for all our people to endure.  The shocking scale of the current banking crisis in Ireland has brought unwelcome attention to Ireland at a bad time but we should remember that banking crises have been a regular enough occurrence and usually follow similar paths.  Ireland's story is not that unusual and reflects the astonishing lack of good authority displayed by the Taoiseach during his tenure in the Department of Finance.  All the signs were there of troubled skies and storms ahead but he refused to pay any attention to the weather forecast and recklessly carried on as before with the very same policies that encouraged disastrous lending practices to developers and home buyers.Northern Rock in the UK was a bank with a business model similar to Anglo Irish Bank.  It collapsed at an early stage long before Lehman Brothers.   The Northern Rock incident was the point when the Irish authorities, political as well as regulatory, should have got a wake-up call and taken action to stave off the Anglo Irish Bank disaster that was coming down the track.  Instead of heeding the wake up call, the then Minister for Fiance, Deputy Brian Cowen, pulled up the duvet cover and went back to sleep.  Over the next months it must have become clear that Irish banks were sitting on big losses and had severe solvency problems, not just liquidity issues.  Insolvency destroyed Northern Rock and that dreaded word surely had to feature in the minds of those in charge.On Sunday, 16 September 2007, the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, following the Northern Rock debacle, vowed that the State would not bail out banks from the consequences of their own reckless lending policies.  Boy, did he do a U-turn.  Then came the St. Patrick's Day massacre of Anglo Irish Bank shares in March 2008, another wake-up call even louder than the earlier one he so wilfully ignored.The events of September 2008 were particularly dramatic but the Anglo Irish Bank contagion had already taken root and was infecting the entire economy.  The Irish banking disaster has followed all the steps that feature in the textbooks on bank failures.  The Government has made all the classic mistakes and allowed the banks to deceive it this day two years ago in September 2008 that they were fundamentally sound and merely enduring short term liquidity problems.  So Ministers spent months pretending — to the people at any rate.  Perhaps they knew differently privately.The documents already published display an incredible culture of denial in Merrion Street.  The true picture was revealed in an appalling drip-feed manner right up to the shock and awe statement in the week before Easter in late March this year.  The Minister's response was to say, "At every hand's turn, our worst fears have been surpassed".  What were those worst fears and why did he not incorporate those fears into his actions?  A wise leader hopes for the best but prepares for the worst.  That is what wise leaders and generals do.  We are in an economic war in this country and our people have been visited with sanctions because we have lost the war that puts us in mind of what happened to the Germans after the First World War.  That is where our desperate generals on the other side of the House have led us.  Deputies know the quote about the First World War: "Lions led by donkeys".  Look at the Government benches and see the calibre of our miserable generals.  There are many adjectives I could use to describe the leaders of this Government.  "Wise" is not one of them.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	613	That document did no such thing.  Yes, Professor Honohan did acknowledge that some kind of guarantee was required, as did I even before 29 September 2008.  A deposit guarantee would have had unanimous support here.  Two weeks beforehand, on 16 September 2008, I looked for a €75,000 guarantee for ordinary depositors.  I got my answer from the Minister — a very short "No".  A year earlier, on 27 September 2007, I had called for a reformed compensation scheme for savers so as to stop a run on the banks following what had happened in Northern Rock.But Professor Honohan went on to ask sceptical questions about the blanket nature of the guarantee put in place that night.  One concerns the inclusion of subordinated debt, an issue also raised at the time in this House by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.  Professor Honohan went on to ask much more fundamental questions that Ministers have chosen to ignore and to misrepresent.  These are his exact words in case Deputies have difficulty in finding them in the Fianna Fáil Ladybird edition of events:The scope of the Irish guarantee was exceptionally broad.  Not only did it cover all deposits, including corporate and even interbank deposits, as well as certain asset backed bonds (covered bonds) and senior debt it also included, as noted already, certain subordinated debt. The inclusion of existing long-term bonds and some subordinated debt was not necessary in order to protect the immediate liquidity position. These investments were in effect locked-in.  Their inclusion complicated eventual loss allocation and resolution options.We have heard so often that many other countries rushed to follow Ireland's lead.  Simply not true.  There have been few cases of such blanket guarantees elsewhere and since then markets been highly sceptical of Ireland's capacity to meet the obligations that decision imposed.Each day we pay the price of that folly.  It put the taxpayer on the hook for almost all losses, even the losses of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  We want and need big banks, like Bank of Ireland and AIB, but who except the people in Fianna Fáil and the cronies particularly, wanted to hold on forever to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide?  Only their cronies in their own political circles, and the developers of course.The blanket guarantee was a direct consequence of the shocking error of judgment over the solvency of Anglo Irish Bank.  It is this guarantee that had dumped the Irish State with the responsibility of meeting the entire cost all of Anglo Irish Bank's liabilities, a bill that has already put us the hook for €24 billion and God knows how much more when the full truth is revealed, perhaps as early as tomorrow.To add to our woes this Government added NAMA to the mix, one extra error of judgment added to the long catalogue of previous errors.  There have been eyebrows raised at the discounts imposed by NAMA.  Why could anyone be surprised that a cash for trash scheme could have had any other outcome?  What is the Minister on about when he says that our excessive disclosure is somehow disadvantageous compared to other countries?  They thought up cash for trash.  NAMA was their own invention.  Why does the Minister moan now? It was his major calling card a few months ago and we were all supposed to be impressed.The NAMA concept was flawed from the start.  The process relating to it has added to the problem by virtue of the tortuously long and drawn out loss estimates it involves.  The decision to put NAMA into the NTMA has brought a cuckoo into the latter's nest.  The NTMA has a good reputation but Fianna Fáil foolishly chose to put NAMA in with it.  In doing so, it has risked the contagion of the NTMA by Anglo Irish Bank and the undermining of our sovereign reputation as a result.  When this matter first arose, everything revolved around reputational damage to banks.  Following two years of Fianna Fáil dealing with the problem, however, we are now faced with serious reputational damage to the sovereign and to the Irish people.  I cannot recall such a level of damage being inflicted upon the country in the past.When the Carroll case came before the High Court 15 months ago it must have been obvious to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the value of commercial property in Ireland had fallen catastrophically and had left gaping holes in the capitalisation of the banks.  He surely did not need to wait the full period for NAMA to do its business before recognising the true scale of losses and the consequent capital hole that they would create.  Despite the guarantee and despite NAMA, the market still lacks confidence in the solvency of the major Irish banks.  In that regard, unfortunately, I must include Bank of Ireland and AIB, which are afraid to lend money to ordinary businesses throughout the country.  As a result, we have a credit famine.  That which I describe has in turn placed a strain on the credibility of the State in the international press and on international markets.The Government has forgotten those whose interests it was elected to serve.  It has no mandate from the Irish people to raid the national coffers to rescue a recklessly mismanaged bank from the consequences of its own folly.  If it does not understand that then it should hold an election in order to see what the people think.Before the commencement of Dáil business earlier today, I went for a walk through town.  I was stopped by quite a number of people who expressed serious concern to me about the man who drove the cement mixing truck into the gates of Leinster House this morning and asked if he would be the only one who would be subject to police proceedings and who would see the inside of a police cell as a result of what has happened during the banking crisis.

What happened thereafter, I do not know.Two years after the original guarantee, which we were promised would cost nothing, we are faced with enormous bills, credit is still scarce, and the cost of Government borrowing is soaring.  The Labour Party has no confidence in the Government's banking strategy.  We stood alone in opposing the original guarantee in September 2008 and we have been more that vindicated by developments since.  As I stated on the night on which the guarantee was introduced, we were not disposed to Fianna Fáil being given a blank cheque.  The Minister for Finance stated earlier that he wants the guarantee to be extended tonight and that he wants another blank cheque.  He also stated that tomorrow he will provide us with a little information about the blank cheque he proposes we sign tonight.On each occasion the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, or the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, have tried to draw a line under the bank losses, they have been found some months later to have completely underestimated the scale of the problem.  We were informed that the original guarantee would be the cheapest bank rescue in the world.  However, it has already cost Irish taxpayers more than €30 billion and the bill keeps rising.  They scoffed last year when the IMF suggested that the total bill could hit €25 billion.  That figure has already been surpassed.  All sorts of people were rushed out to inform us that the IMF had it wrong.We are being asked to extend the guarantee but we are not yet being told what will be the cost of the last blank cheque.  The Government is insisting on voting this through but it will not tell us the cost of the bail-outs for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and nor will it outline the position of the two important and major high street retail banks.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	622	Two years on from the original bank guarantee, the Government has still made no progress with the introduction of a special resolution regime for the banks.  Once the guarantee was granted, the introduction of such a resolution mechanism was the only realistic way in which the financial burden could be shared appropriately between taxpayers and the banks' investors.  As of midnight, some €40 billion in bank liabilities — that is not a trifle — will fall outside the guarantee when it expires.  In the absence of a bank resolution Act, it will be difficult to ensure that the relevant bondholders make a fair contribution to cost of the banking failure.  The only exception in this regard relates to the sub-debt, which only represents a small proportion of the €40 billion to which I refer.  As Deputy Noonan stated, this sub-debt has already been regularly subjected to sales by the institutions and to buy-backs.In the weeks before the original blanket guarantee was put in place, the Labour Party called for enhanced protections for ordinary depositors.  However, these protections should not have been extended to the professional investors who took a punt on bank loans.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, has since vindicated this position in his report on the banking crisis.A system of omerta has been official Government policy on the banks from the outset.  Labour was briefed on this motion at 10 a.m. and the Department was unable to answer basic questions put to it by the Labour Party.  The following are the questions we asked: will Irish banks be facing a further funding cliff in December, when the guarantee extension is set to expire, how much debt has each institution guaranteed under the ELG scheme to date — the Minister stated that it is €150 billion in total — how much debt is expected to be issued under the ELG scheme between now and the end of December, will the government urgently introduce a special resolution scheme for banks and is a further extension of the guarantee beyond December envisaged?  The latter part of the Minister’s contribution would appear to indicate that the answer to the final question we posed is yes.The Government has also choreographed events in such a way as to give the Dáil the least amount of time possible to consider the motion on the renewal of the bank guarantee.  The Dáil has been in recess for 12 weeks.  When the Government decided that the new session would commence today, it knew that a decision on the renewal of the scheme would have to be made by midnight.  Why was the Dáil not brought back earlier in order that it would have adequate time to consider the renewal proposal?  We are also being asked to make this decision on the guarantee a day before the Financial Regulator is to disclose the full extent of the likely cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank.Earlier today, the Taoiseach stated that he did not know the figures.  I have many different views about Deputy Cowen, not all of which are complimentary.  However, the suggestion that the Taoiseach in charge of the greatest disaster in our history has not received good and sound advice on the ballpark figures that will be revealed tomorrow is fatuous in the extreme.

The former is something one does not want in financial markets while the latter is highly desirable.  In the two years since the original guarantee was introduced, the Government has systematically destroyed confidence in Ireland, its banks and in Ireland as a sovereign.  It has allowed the contagion of Anglo Irish Bank to infect everything.  Essentially, the latter has become a virus and a cancer in the body politic and the business community of Ireland.  It is time the Government stopped what it is doing.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	627	I thank the Minister and his officials for the briefing this morning.  However, I also echo Deputy Noonan's comments when he pointed out that it was a confidential briefing.  I do not understand why they could not have been more forthcoming in answering some of the questions raised because as far as I am aware there has never been a breach of the confidentiality by any Opposition spokespersons who undertook such confidentiality.We enter a new Dáil session and it will again be dominated by the banking crisis two years on.  Is that a sign of incompetence?  Instead of having one Anglo Irish Bank, we will now have two — or three if NAMA is included.  We will have three administrations and everything in triplicate.  So much for efficiencies, but then what would one expect from the Government that brought us the tripling of the costs of the Dublin Port tunnel, the doubling of the cost of the Luas and much more?  There is no point in enumerating all of that this evening as we have done so often before.The Government has told us for two years now that sorting out the banking crisis is its priority.  It is not so much its priority, but the only issue on its agenda apart from slashing the incomes of low and middle-income families as we have witnessed in the past three budgets and we are certainly likely to see it again in December's budget based on the promises from the Government parties.  Let us consider how the Government is getting on with the banks two years after the Minister for Finance told us that this was the cheapest bailout in the world.  He did not say that at the time the guarantee scheme was initially introduced, but when the terms and conditions were announced.  Like Deputy Noonan I had an early night last night and was home by 9.30 p.m.  I saw the "Prime Time" programme which showed the clip of the Minister standing here in the Chamber when he said that.  He also told us the worst was over at a time when although the guarantees were in place, no money had been pumped into Anglo Irish Bank.  God help anybody who believed him on that occasion and God help anybody who believes a word that any member of the Government says.I do not want to dwell on this point, but it is worth quoting the person who was in charge of the Department of Finance through much of the period when the bankers and speculators were wrecking our economy.  The Taoiseach told us, "It is my intention to ensure that the Irish taxpayer will not be held liable in any way for any deficit that might occur".  How can we believe a word that man says given what has happened since he said that in 2008?  This is the same person who met representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland on 29 September 2008 and knew exactly what was going on, as has clearly emerged.  There are no excuses left for this man.Let us be clear about this important point, which has been reiterated by many economists, including Professor Patrick Honohan.  There was no need for a blanket guarantee in September 2008.  The Government greatly over-stepped the mark and, as a result, burdened the taxpayers with many billions of euro.  The amount is still unquantified — although it might be quantified by tomorrow afternoon.  So much protection has been offered to the bondholders that considerable suspicion has grown as to their identity.  Are some of them part of yet another golden circle?  People are entitled to be suspicious given the Government's record.  While I am sure many of them may be international investors, suspicion is growing as to their identity and the Government will not inform us who these investors are.  Bluff and bluster has been the order of the day.I will now address some of the technicalities of the scheme.  In debating the motion before the House tonight it is necessary to revert back to the original eligible liabilities guarantee scheme of 2009, not only to gain perspective on what the Government is proposing, but also to highlight the delusion and faults inherent in the Government's banking strategy.  Of special importance is the reference in the Schedule at 2.4 that the Minister makes this scheme having regard to "minimising the potential cost to the Exchequer and taxpayers".  Nothing could be further from the realities of this scheme and the faulted banking strategy of Government.  Its strategy of creating stability through the bailout of our banking institutions has failed.The result of today's motion will be that certain bank liabilities will be guaranteed up to 2015.  The Minister for Finance is able to extend the guarantee scheme on a piecemeal basis as far as 2015.  In real terms, the extension of the guarantee simply represents taxpayer crutches for the bank sector.  By virtue of provisions of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Minister can extend the period of financial support by ministerial order.  This effectively means that the Government can draw out the terms of guarantee and extend financial supports to banks indefinitely, once the European Commission consents.  The taxpayer is being asked to provide yet another lifeboat for the banks.  The critical issue that must be addressed is whether the banking system with the aid of this guarantee can turn itself around, transform into a system that serves the domestic economy by providing the credit much-needed by businesses and households and whether placing this burden on the taxpayer is warranted.  The answer is clearly "No".The ELG scheme allows bonds to be issued with maturities of up to five years, with the bonds having the full backing of the Government to their maturity.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, introduced the original ELG scheme to the Dáil in December last year, he advised that these provisions would enhance the banks'"ability to discharge their central role in facilitating economic activity in the State" and he also advised that allowing institutions to issue unguaranteed debt was "key to restoring market confidence in the institutions".  Nearly ten months later, neither of these objectives has materialised.  In fact, there has been a complete shift in the opposite direction.  Looking at the bond markets alone we see that bonds have been under pressure for some time amid concerns over the cost of the bank bailout and the sovereign debt.  Yesterday Irish bond yields hit a new record high of nearly 6.8%, which is not restoring confidence.  The Government is running this State into the ground and market confidence is hitting the floor as demonstrated by yesterday's bond yields.  The people of this State lost confidence in the Government long ago and it is clear that the international markets have also.The banking crisis is quickly becoming a sovereign-debt crisis because a prolonged guarantee puts us all on the hook.  The inclusion of Anglo Irish Bank in the guarantee is the principal reason the taxpayer is being required to pump what seems like endless billions into the black hole of Anglo Irish Bank.  Approximately €10 billion in bond debt held by Anglo Irish Bank was loaned by investors since September 2008 and it is subject to an explicit guarantee.  The debt raised in this way is under a legally enforceable State guarantee.The original eligible liability guarantee scheme of 2009 stated that the Minister made the scheme having regard to "minimising the potential cost to the Exchequer and taxpayers".  Nothing could be further from the realities of this scheme and the faulted banking strategy of Government.  The bill for the taxpayer is running into billions.  The Government strategy of creating stability through the bailout of our banking institutions has failed.  The taxpayer is being asked to provide yet another lifeboat for the banks.  The critical issue that must be addressed is whether the banking system with the aid of this guarantee can turn itself around, transform into a system that serves the domestic economy by providing the credit much-needed by businesses and households and whether placing this burden on the taxpayer is warranted.I have a few questions about what the Minister knew in September 2008 and what they claimed they did not know.  We were told the problem was a liquidity issue and not an insolvency issue.  Can this point be clarified before this debate concludes?  It is a critical issue and it is only fair and reasonable that it be clarified.How much does the Minister estimate will be required to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland?  If he does not have the figures this evening, will he inform us as to when they will be available and be published?  It is important all Members have this information as soon as it is available.This afternoon, responding to questions from my colleague Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Taoiseach claimed he did not mislead the Dáil and had no additional information as to the true state of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish banking sector when he met with AIB and Bank of Ireland in Government Buildings before announcing the guarantee two years ago.  This is now being proved wrong.This morning we saw the anger among the public demonstrated by the action taken with a cement truck at the Kildare Street entrance to Leinster House.  It is important the Minister of State, Deputy White, knows the anger out there.  It is also important the Green Party takes its responsibility for what is happening to the Government's policy on the banks.  The Green Party must realise it is propping up the Government and is not just a passive passenger along for the ride.  This is real stuff and is manifesting itself in more anger.The man involved in this morning's incident, of course, was hauled off to a Garda station, a matter which Deputy Burton earlier said was raised with her by people on the streets.  I too have had telephone calls from constituents asking why this man is holed up in a Garda station being questioned about his actions when the bankers and speculators, aided and abetted by government policy, who wrecked the economy are not even questioned by any authority.  A former Taoiseach told us that anyone decrying the massive property bubble should commit suicide while Ministers looked the other way or actively encouraged the speculators and bankers.  It is time the Green Party takes its responsibility in all of this and lets us know where it stands.  The issue of moral hazard is close to hand at this point.The pouring of billions of euro into the banks is not happening without a significant cost to the people.  In the past few weeks, I have been dealing with constituency cases of single middle-aged men critically ill with cancer being discharged home before their treatment has been completed.  No after-treatment care was available for them because of cutbacks in public spending.  People, already traumatised through ill health, are being penalised by the Government's policy to look after the banks and their bondholders.It must be remembered the bondholders did not lend their money to this State.  They lent their money to private banks.  If I go broke, will the Government bail me out?  Of course it will not.  There needs to be a serious rethink of the consequences of this guarantee and the bailout before incidents much worse than what happened at the Leinster House gates this morning occur across this State.

Neither is it responsible for the reckless lending that took place in the country's financial institutions.  However, it is committed to resolving the problems that have arisen from reckless lending by our bankers and which have had a devastating effect on the economy.The 2008 credit institutions scheme gave a blanket guarantee for Irish banking institutions.  It was an important measure without which the banks would have faced certain collapse with devastating consequences for the economy.  While the measure was supported by Fine Gael at the time, the Labour Party decided not to.  Had its policy seen the light of the day, the consequences for Ireland would have been drastic, affecting not just Anglo Irish Bank but the other Irish banks because of how they are all interconnected.  The State would not have had access to international money markets to fund its day-to-day activities with dreadful consequences for society.There has been much misquoting of the Governor of the Central Bank tonight.  In his recent report on the banking guarantee, he stated an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place; otherwise our banks would have run out of money in days and have been forced to close their doors.  He went on to state, "Closure of all, or a large part, of the banking system would have entailed a catastrophic immediate and sustained economy-wide disruption".  This from the Governor praised by all sides of the House.The eligible liabilities guarantee scheme was introduced in December 2009 to provide access to longer term funding for our financial institutions.  The scheme allows them to issue both guaranteed and non-guaranteed liabilities which will help reduce their reliance on State support, a development all Members would like to see when markets improve.I support the extension of the scheme, as proposed by the Minister for Finance, recommended by the Governor of the Central Bank and approved of by the European Commission.

This has been going on for two years and I am very disappointed.  I have made my views clear at party meetings and elsewhere.  Some people have accused me of supporting one bank over another.  The bank that is lending again is Ulster Bank, a stand alone organisation in this country that is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland.  It must be productive and work properly.  It lost its chief executive recently.  No one can identify me with any bank over another.  I like to praise the bridge as I cross it and what is good for our economy and country.I am concerned about the way we are directing our bank system and I question NAMA.  Any balance sheet with €81 billion debt is horrendous.  It will destroy the balance sheets of all banks incorporated in it.  Was it even necessary?  I came in here honestly and squarely and supported NAMA but I am convinced it was the most foolish thing ever.  I normally question things, I am seen in my party as the person who does not fall into line with everything.  I regret NAMA and believe we were sold a pig in a poke.  It will do serious damage to the banks.  The people I talk to are not fools and they know that 20% of the €81 billion will be toxic.  Over five years, if that 20% is worked off, we will do right.We can look at what happened in Britain.  Lloyds TSB was forced to take over Bank of Scotland.  It is now talking about paying a dividend and it will make €40 billion for the British Government.  What have we done in the past two years?  We do not know we are doing.  Academics and bureaucrats are running the banking system when we want the good business people we had before.Dr. Somers, whom we put in place, who worked with Ray MacSharry, Deputy Bertie Ahern, Albert Reynolds and the Taoiseach, where is he now?  He is out sniping at us and telling us we have gone the wrong way.  It is about time we faced up to the challenge and it is about time the Minister for Finance put this to bed without putting the liability on Irish taxpayers.

I have never heard a bigger admission by the leader of a political party in the history of the State of an inability to get his head around the extent of the issues involved.  The real reason behind the shift in the stance of Fine Gael is more to do with recent poll figures for the leader of the Labour Party, where he is a more popular leader of the Opposition than Deputy Kenny.  The Labour Party has been flapping its wings with much excitement and Deputy Kenny has fallen into the same trap.  This short-sighted behaviour has led to gains for the Labour Party but they will be short-lived.We on the Government benches are sorting out our banks now that our recession is turning the corner.  We all know how volatile our seats are but our country comes first.  It is called principle, something some on the Opposition side know nothing about.  I knew the Labour Party was brazen enough to oppose for the sake of opposing, no matter what the consequences for the country, but I thought Fine Gael had more bottle.  Today is a new era for Fine Gael, it is following the Labour Party lead of populist policy no matter what the consequences are for people.It is a sad night when the Opposition is calling into question the expertise of the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, based on fiction.  I call on the media to take a balanced view on this and ask the hard questions of the Opposition that need to be asked, to inform the people of the inability of the Opposition parties to offer a credible Government.  It is no wonder there are such cries from them for a general election because they will be found out and their populist policies will be short-lived.

That is symbolic of something.The guarantee reminds me of the original guarantee scheme, which was introduced on 30 September 2008.  We were not provided with the full facts then.  I remember on the night that the question was asked why the Government was including dated subordinated debt lower tier 2 but there was no answer.We still do not know the final cost of Anglo Irish Bank.  Why was the cost not announced prior to the extension of the ELG scheme?  The cost of borrowing on international markets is at a record high, a direct result of Government banking and fiscal policy.  Once we get through the Minister for Finance's sweet talk, this is about a policy that has failed.  Why was the Minister for Finance rushing in here on 30 September 2008 to introduce a guarantee scheme for a bank that was insolvent, even though he claimed the problem was one of liquidity?  The share price for Anglo Irish Bank tumbled in March 2008 and the then CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency, Dr. Michael Somers, stated that he had major reservations about putting deposits into Anglo Irish Bank because of the sheer weight of property.  Why did we reach a point where crisis management led to decisions being made on the hoof when they had such major ramifications for taxpayers?In the two year period since, €24 billion has gone into Anglo Irish Bank, with €30 billion for all the banks.  We still do not know the final figure for Anglo Irish Bank.  Credit is still not being extended to small businesses and the financial sovereignty of the State is at risk because of Government policy.NAMA is a disaster that has achieved the opposite of what it was set up to do.  It was supposed to stabilise the property market and get credit flowing but it has done neither.  The hair cuts in Anglo Irish Bank are so severe they show the inherent rot in the development loan books of all the banks.  There was a two year window of opportunity under the bank guarantee and Fine Gael proposed that banks would deal with their loan books in that period and negotiate with their investors, ensuring the taxpayer would be the last person to pick up the tab.  What happened?  The taxpayer was the first to pick up the tab and no credit is flowing to the SME sector.  That was a policy flaw.  At every step along the way the Government has got it wrong.  The guarantee had to be introduced, and we also had to guarantee deposits.  No one disagrees with that.  However, for the previous year it was clear there were major problems with Anglo Irish Bank that should have been dealt with and we should not have had a situation where, in effect, the Government guaranteed a bank that was insolvent.  There are questions for the Minister for Finance to answer.  What happened on the night of 29 September, when Bank of Ireland and AIB came to meet the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on foot of Anglo Irish Bank going to Bank of Ireland, looking for that bank to take it over because it was insolvent?  The Minister needs to spell out precisely in the House what happened at that meeting.I find it incredible that the Government was not aware that Anglo Irish Bank was insolvent.  We are entitled to know.  We have to get answers from the Minister for Finance.  We need a bank resolution scheme put in place by 1 November and to commence immediately negotiations with the holders of subordinated bonds.  We need a banking system which functions, but we also need a Government that knows what it is doing.  The current Government does not know what it is doing in terms of banking and the economy.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	645	It was indicated under the bank guarantee that NAMA would be the solution and the Government would not admit to its mistakes.  We were sold a pup.  It is not fit for purpose.  The guarantee was extended and substantial change was promised by the banks with the appointment of public interest directors.  However, little or nothing has happened since then.  All the same Government and civil service personnel are in place.  Nobody wants to rock the boat.  For every action there is a reaction but what we have seen in the economy is the loss of jobs, talented people leaving and the emigration of a generation of young people.  This country is on the rocks.The banking sector is paralysed.  There is no confidence or credit in the economy.  There are now rock-bottom values for properties.  The haircut and the hit the taxpayer has taken on the deficit is immense.  What banks will finance NAMA properties in the future?  No Irish banks will finance such properties; European banks will come in and get property for little or nothing.  We were told NAMA would be a wall of cash, which is not the situation.Regarding due diligence, up to 40 people have bankrupted the country.  After spending €34 million on advisers, the Government still has not solved the problem of the indebtedness in Anglo Irish Bank.  Can one believe it?  Some €34 million was spent on consultants over two years and they still cannot tell us what the final figure will be.  They want us to sign a guarantee this evening and come in with the figure tomorrow.  We should consider Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Nationwide and the EBS.The NTMA has been damaged by the incorporation of NAMA.  It had a very fine reputation for raising money, but high charges are currently being paid for bonds.  In terms of the three supports for the economy, the Government has bankrolled the banks to an unparalleled extent.  One would expect the banks to support businesses and the taxpayer.  Taxpayers have bankrolled every bank as a result of the Government's policy and one would imagine that the banks would support businesses, which would, in turn, support job creation, but that has not happened.Tier one of three supports has been delivered.  The taxpayer has bankrolled every bank but the banks have not supported the economy.  Jobs are being lost.  Another of the three supports for any economy is the retention of jobs.  A large amount of money has been lost and people are fed up.  Some €34 billion is involved.  Fine Gael's policy was to put €2 billion into a stand alone national recovery bank that would support small companies.  Many years ago ICC was a very effective bank which supported small start-up companies.  Nobody is giving money to businesses at the moment.  Viable businesses are closing.  There is no cashflow, confidence or credit.The Government has presided over this situation and is totally incompetent.  People cannot take any more.  Enough is enough.  They want a change of government.  The business community is on the floor.  There is no sense of inspiration, confidence or hope out there.  We are expecting the Minister to come in and give a solemn commitment on what we are now doing and, given all that has occurred, that something will happen.Regarding the bondholders, it is like paying an insurance policy and not claiming on it.  Why should the bondholders not take some of the hit or negotiate some of the reduction in light of the fact that some bondholders will not be covered by the guarantee?  It has been appalling.  If this was a business, every director would be sacked instantly and their curricula vitae, referrals and recommendations would be appalling.  They would deserve no record of competence, capability or job creation.  This economy is on the floor, driven by this Government which expects to fool the electorate again by reassuring them.  There is no confidence out there.  The banks are not giving out money and no jobs are being created.  Nothing the Minister will say will change that opinion.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The only point on which we will all agree is that the reckless lending practices of banks have brought about the banking crisis.  As far as I am concerned, the Government's actions over the past two years has saved this country from financial ruin.  In putting forward the new ELG scheme, the Government has effectively followed the European model that 21 other countries have adopted.  I do not think anyone in the House would dispute that Germany is the strongest economic entity in Europe.  It has this scheme in practice and if it is good enough for Germany, it is certainly good enough for Ireland.One should recognise that the Government has always acted in a responsible way and has not been like the Opposition, which is taking cheap political shots.  The Governor of the Central Bank, our new Financial Regulator, the EU and the ECB have all backed this scheme.  It is not as if it was dreamt up by some little minnow.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party should recognise that.  This plan has been carefully thought out at the highest level in Europe among all of its expert bankers in light of the crisis Europe has experienced.As far as I am concerned, I am happy that what the Government brought about two years ago has worked out well.  It has achieved a profit of €1 billion for the State, with no losses.  Deputy Perry referred to insurance, of which I have some experience.  Those who make insurance claims, generally speaking, are penalised.Deputy Burton referred to Northern Rock.  I wish to restate what I said some months ago.  The UK Government poured £850 billion into its banking system and £30 billion into Northern Rock in order that the people who queued up outside its doors all across the UK and in Dublin could get their money.  In the US, some $12.8 trillion has been put into the banking system in order to make sure it stays stable.  Recently President Obama announced that he will spent another $500 billion to try to revitalise the economy and keep the banking system going.For those who want to criticise the Irish Government or try to draw comparisons that exist here, the reality is that right across Europe, the USA and the UK banks have failed and have severe liquidity and insolvency problems.  The UK and US Governments had the privilege of printing new money, unlike Ireland and European countries where we borrowed from the ECB and other international lenders.  They printed their own money; we have to earn it or borrow it.In terms of reputation — I come from an insurance background and I have dealt with credit insurance — if people default on loans they get a black mark against their records and they find it exceptionally difficult to get future lending or credit.  That is the sad reality of life and it is wrong for anybody in this Chamber to say we should let Anglo Irish Bank go to the wall.  We would have everyone in Ireland queuing outside their banks, building societies and credit unions to take out their money and put it under the mattress.  That is the reality.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	647	In the brief time available to me I want to pose the following question.  What would be the consequences for the country of not renewing the eligible liabilities guarantee tonight?  Where would we be as a country?  Where would our banking system be?If we take the perspective of a United States multinational with a large corporate deposit in an Irish bank tonight and which learns tomorrow morning that the guarantee which was in place was not renewed, what would it do with that deposit?  The first thing it would do is move it out of the Irish banking system and into one in another country where the guarantee was extended to end December, which would completely undermine the funding base of the Irish banks.  Undoubtedly, there would be a flight of deposits from this country tomorrow morning in the event of the Labour Party's view holding sway in this House tonight, which I hope will not be the case.The second consequence is that the Irish banks, which currently rely on the guarantee, would not be able to access funding on the wholesale markets because they cannot access them without a guarantee being in place.  Even if they were able to access some funding, it would come at such a price by the bond holders on the international markets that the banks would have no option but to immediately hike up interest rates for businesses in Ireland and for personal customers.  Those are the two obvious consequences I foresee in the event of this House rejecting the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee.As Deputy Kennedy said, the scheme has been approved by the European Union.  It has been recommended by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, and Matthew Elderfield, the Financial Regulator, both of whom the Opposition parties claim to have respect for, and this initiative before the House tonight is on their recommendation.  We all agree that we want to see the Irish banks weaned off the guarantee.  We want to see it withdrawn on a gradual basis but it must be done in a responsible fashion and one which allows the Irish banking system to plan its way out of the guarantee currently in place.I heard Deputy Kenny during Leaders' Questions seek to characterise Professor Honohan's comments on the banking report and claiming that he said the Government was wrong on the guarantee.  Glib comments such as those by political leaders do not help our cause, and I invite him to read again page 14 of the report where Governor Honohan clearly endorses the substance of the guarantee.  One can argue around the edges of it, including the 3% sub-debt and so forth, but he clearly backed the need for an extensive guarantee to be put in place.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I welcome the opportunity to address this motion.  There has been much comment about the guarantee scheme in the past year, much of it negative and much of it ill-informed.  There has been little by way of alternative solutions to the problem that existed, and still exists, in coming forward with a solution to the banking problem.There has been considerable focus by some in the Opposition on the cost of recapitalisation of the banks in the context of the guarantee scheme.  A cloak has been wrapped around the cost of the recapitalisation to somehow create an impression that the sizeable cost was somehow a factor or a fault of the existence of the guarantee.  Suggestions have been made that had no guarantee been put in place the market would have resolved the position and that all would be fine by now.  That is a fallacy with which we all have to deal.I listened to Deputy Noonan's balanced contribution.  Unfortunately, others within Fine Gael have not been quite so balanced in the past year.  However, he concentrated a good deal on whether the Minister was aware of the solvency crisis as opposed to the liquidity issue on the night the scheme was first introduced.  Deputy O'Donnell continued that theme.  The fact remains that it would not have mattered a hat of crabs because the effect would have been the same.  The banks were on the verge of collapse and to allow any of them to go under would have had greater repercussions than we have experienced to date.  It is clear, therefore, that there was a necessity to put the guarantee in place.

That suggestion was put forward by some people in the past year.  The question they have to answer, however, is whether they would support the default of depositors, as Deputy McGrath has identified, and senior bond holders.  The Deputy went through the list of the people involved.  Many of them are large employers who have accounts containing pay packets of workers.  Others are charitable institutions.  We know that the credit unions and local authorities are considerable depositors, and there are some holders of bonds.It must be recognised also that senior bonds are investment instruments, in many cases of large employers in this country.  The suggestion has been made by some that we can somehow welsh on that.  If the Deputies opposite are prepared to turn their backs on those depositors and bond holders, how do they propose to manage the economy into the future?Deputy O'Donnell has talked about that in the past, and his party's NewERA document proposes the panacea for all our employment issues but much of that is funded through the issuance of bonds.  It would be a new era.  They would be breaking new ground in that regard.  Their suggestion that they should welsh on the bond holders——

It states:. . . the Irish guarantee differed from the approach followed by almost every other country in also guaranteeing the full stock of existing debts for two years.This part of the guarantee did not help deal with the crisis at hand.  Honohan's report [said that the] "inclusion of existing long-term bonds and some subordinated debt ... was not necessary in order to protect the immediate liquidity position.  These investments were in effect locked-in."Honohan went on to say: "In contrast to most of the interventions by other countries, in which more or less complicated risk-sharing mechanisms of one sort or another were introduced, the blanket cover offered by the Irish guarantee pre-judged that all losses in any bank becoming insolvent during the guarantee period — beyond those absorbed by some of the providers of capital — would fall on the State."He noted:"the extent of the cover provided (including to outstanding long-term bonds) can — even without the benefit of hindsight — be criticised inasmuch as it complicated and narrowed the eventual resolution options for the failing institutions and increased the State's potential share of the losses".

Dated subordinated debt was guaranteed in relation to the two institutions that are most distressed — Irish Nationwide Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank.  No dated principal sum on foot of dated subordinated debt was paid during the guarantee period, and indeed none falls due for a number of years.  Hence, there is no loss to the taxpayer in respect of that guarantee because the sums involved were never paid out of those institutions, and we are free to deal with that issue tomorrow.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	674	We said that.

The principal of that debt did not fall due for payment during the guarantee period.  Again, there was no loss to the institutions in respect of that particular guarantee because no money or principal sum was paid out on foot of it.However, the question of the treatment of that particular debt has arisen in the context of the resolution of Anglo Irish Bank and it is the clear advice of Patrick Honohan, as Governor of the Central Bank, that those obligations should continue to be met by the respective——

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Deputy Burton, please.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	681	Really Deputy, I am trying to address the issue raised by Deputy Rabbitte and I am making the point that the Governor is very clear in his advice that those obligations should be met by those banks in due course, first because senior bond holders as a matter of law in Ireland rank equally with depositors and therefore under the relevant EU legislation and under our domestic constitutional arrangements, any haircut to them would have to apply equally to depositors, which I assume nobody in this House wishes to do but perhaps I will hear a different policy from the Labour Party on this next week.Second, to dishonour or raise any suggestion of a dishonouring of senior debt would be very damaging for our capacity to raise funds and for the capacity of the banks to raise funds.  This is my response to what was a considered intervention by Deputy Rabbitte.I thank the Members of the House for their contributions to this debate.  Although Deputy Noonan's proposed amendment was disallowed and he may feel constrained to oppose the motion, I want to thank him for the constructive tenor of what he said on the record this evening and I hope I can be of some assistance to him in this regard.Three substantive issues were raised by Deputy Noonan, the first related to the question of resolution regimes for distressed credit institutions.  Previously, I indicated in the House that I am examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions to ensure the State has in place a range of tools to address problem institutions, effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public money and ensuring continuity of key banking activities.  In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions, my Department is consulting with the Central Bank and the regulator to develop the necessary legislative proposals.  I would expect that this process would lead to the introduction of an appropriate legislative framework for bank restructuring in line with what Deputy Noonan wishes to see and secure.

I touched on this issue in my reply to Deputy Rabbitte and again I will deal with it in the statement to be made tomorrow on the banking system.The third matter was the question of the original guarantee of 29 September and the state of knowledge of the Government on questions of solvency and capital at that stage.  I do not question Deputy Noonan's good faith in any respect in this regard and I did interrupt him when he made his contribution.  The fact is that the basis for the story that somehow there was wider knowledge of the capital and solvency difficulties in Anglo Irish Bank in September 2008 is traced back to an alleged conversation with an alleged official at Bank of Ireland who has never been identified or who has never given particulars of the conversation.  I have made it clear that if such a conversation took place that the person involved should report the matter immediately to the Garda Síochána because were it the case that directors of Anglo Irish Bank disclosed to another official that they were aware of the insolvency of their institution as early as September 2008, they would have exposed themselves to considerable criminal hazard.  I know this is a matter about which Members of the House are very anxious, and Deputy Noonan indicated that he is anxious to have the present investigation proceeded with as quickly as possible.

All I can say is that the concerns he had expressed in that article did not materialise in respect of the more extended coverage for the taxpayer.  In his more recent report he concluded that a wide-ranging guarantee was essential that night, as a wide-ranging guarantee is essential this evening and it gives me no pleasure to say it.  Were this guarantee not given this evening our banks would be in a perilous condition.  The reality we all have to face is that the funding position of these institutions, which are dependent on international markets for their funding, has been perilous in recent years.  We do not have to go back as far as St. Patrick's Day; we can go back to recent weeks and look at the bond spreads on Irish Government debt to understand the stresses our banking system must be under.  It is coming to the point where the type of clap-trap that Deputy Burton regularly comes out with in this House has nothing to contribute to the resolution of our nation's problems——

In the space of the last two years, we have lost a quarter of a million jobs and this decline has not yet halted.  As more than 80% of those who have lost their jobs are under the age of 30, this constitutes a really serious blow to our young labour force.  Moreover, recent days have witnessed the huge emergence of emigration as a factor affecting Irish people.  The emigration level of young Irish people has doubled in the last two years.  It shortly will be the equivalent of the entire cohort of young people coming out of school and college leaving the country each year.  These are the people who have been abandoned by the lack of an effective employment strategy from the Government.  These are the very people who we should be nurturing because they will be the building blocks of the economic recovery we must build.  Instead, they will be building the economic futures of Australia, Canada and other far-flung places.  This represents an enormous challenge to this State.I do not pretend that Ireland does not have huge fiscal and banking crises that threaten our very economic survival as they undoubtedly exist.  However, if we view the solving of those two problems as being the goals of policy, we shall fail.  The goal of policy must be about fixing people's lives and what has gone wrong with the lives of those who have been so disrupted by this crisis.  The banking and fiscal problems are real and are constraints on what we can do about the challenges to fix people's lives.  However, they are not the goal of policy.  While people will recognise that they are real constraints, they do not render us powerless.  Sadly, however, that has been the feature of Government thinking with regard to the jobs crisis.  It has felt itself to be powerless and is obsessed with dealing with the banking and fiscal problems and has not yet focused on the need for a job strategy, which is the only key that will bring together all those problems with some chance of success.Had the Government adopted the budgetary approach put forward by Fine Gael last year, which was fully compliant with the €4 billion in savings that needed to be made according to the agreement with the European Union, 50,000 more people would now be gainfully occupied in this economy than is the case at present.  This would be a highly significant change and boost to confidence.  More than 10,000 of them would be engaged in laying out infrastructures such as a smart electricity grid, a decent water system or decent broadband.  Another 10,000 would still be with the employers who otherwise would have let them go because of the work sharing proposals that Fine Gael proposed to stop employers from thinking of redundancy as the first option in a recession.  Another 10,000 would be recruits as a result of cutting the labour costs arising from the PRSI system associated with taking on an employee by 3% and a further 20,000 would have been young people engaged in work experience or re-skilling.  All of the proposals were possible to implement and we fitted them within the budgetary constraints.  It is not that we are powerless to address these problems but simply that the Government's priorities have lain elsewhere.  I am not pretending either that the choices we made are easy.  They require forcing changes in the way we manage the money we have at our disposal.  They would not be comfortable for people who are quite cosy with the existing arrangements but unfortunately the world has changed dramatically and we must change with it.  The Government has failed to recognise that unless it has a credible job strategy, all the rest of its efforts will be set at nought.As a community, we really do have big choices to make.  They will determine whether we create a successful future or we will spend all our time trying to shore up the mistakes of the past.  The tragedy of economic policy in the past 18 months to two years is that it has been all about trying to nurse along the failures of the past instead of trying to create a better future with employment creation.In the banking crisis, the policy has essentially been all about nursing along the bad loans of the past and, in the process, starving new businesses of credit.  All recruitment to the public service has been stopped but the Government has not reformed existing work practices.  The Government has shied away from doing so.  We have raised taxes and cut pay but we have not streamlined the very system of government itself, which represents the future.  We have slashed investment in infrastructure at the very time when it is required.  We are told time and again by the National Competitiveness Council that the core problems are that broadband is not adequate and that electricity and waste disposal are too expensive.  The list goes on.  All the problems are key infrastructure problems.We have cut the rate of social welfare but we have not removed the traps that stop people from fulfilling their potential.  Now is the time in which we must radically reform the way we proceed in order to give Ireland a chance of creating employment for its people.  The problem is that we will be abandoning the new generation if we continue to pursue policies that are about battening down the hatches, pulling up the ladder behind us and letting the outsiders survive on their own.  Unfortunately, those who are being left outside to bear the full brunt of the storm are the young people who are so important to our future.I do not want to be in the business of knocking anybody's ideas but I believe the strategy document, which is another version of the document on the smart economy, is appalling.  It represents a cobbling together of existing targets from different sources that we have seen already.  It was a cynical exercise.  There is not one new policy or initiative announced in the document.  It was a matter of doctoring targets to give a press release.  There is nothing that would change the policy that has already been adopted; that is the tragedy.  It is all about continuity in respect of what everyone was doing before.  No person in any agency will wake up tomorrow morning and say he or she will do something different because of the publication of the strategy statement.  Nothing has changed.  That should not be the case.It is not a case of business as usual.  Solving the jobs crisis is not just a matter of continuing to let the agencies do what they were always doing.  The problem does not lie with the agencies.  Ministers, who are at the core and responsible for most of the developments that are holding back our jobs success, will not square up to the problem and take responsibility for it themselves.  One example is that Ministers have said they would cut €500 million off the unnecessary compliance cost for business.  That is €500 million that businesses could do with.  To date, after three years of supposedly pursuing that objective, the Government has cut €20 million.  Less than 4% of the target has been achieved in three years.  Who is taking responsibility?  Whose job is on the line in the Cabinet because of the 95% failure to meet the targets set by the Government?  The reality is that none is on the line.  No Minister feels under threat because he is failing to deliver something that was promised time and again to businesspeople who are trying to create employment.The same could be said of implementing the recommendations of the Competition Authority.  Some 50% of them have been ignored.  Last year it was promised there would be a mechanism for ensuring they would be implemented.  This has not been honoured.  Costs in areas of key infrastructure were to be lowered.  That was a core message from the National Competitiveness Council, but nothing has been done about it.  We were to see a response to the small business credit problem but, as yet, there is none.  The strategy statement is silent on all these issues.  It is silent on infrastructure, credit flow, the excessive costs of Government services, barriers to entry to business and virtually everything the National Competitiveness Council has told us time and again is holding back progress.The tragedy is that the Government wants to create an illusion that it is doing something.  What it has done is set up another committee.  That is the essence of the strategy that was launched yesterday.  This is simply not good enough.  We face enormous handicaps and the solutions to those were given to the Government as long ago as 2007 in the recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council.  The council raised all the key issues, including those associated with waste policy, interconnection on the electricity grid, e-Government, public service reform, quango reviews, the payment of bonuses to people who did not deliver results, the reform of the regulatory system and the promotion of competition.  The council referred to virtually all the key initiatives that would make employment easier to create.  The recommendations were put on the Government's desk in 2007 when it took up office but none has been addressed.  That is why we do not have an effective employment strategy.  Governments will not take responsibility for what they have been directly charged with doing.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	731	Fine Gael will think big about the potential of the small business sector to generate jobs.  This week's Fianna Fáil announcement on jobs is not credible.  Effectively, it means creating 1,200 new jobs per week and it makes no allowance for the huge number of job losses.  The document is not credible; it just announces another new quango.  The proposal to create 60,000 jobs over five years does not stack up when one considers the numbers of jobs created and lost over the past five years.  Fianna Fáil has destroyed our economy, closed down the enterprise culture and destroyed the hopes and livelihoods of thousands of families throughout the country.There is no point in the Government trying to pretend the disaster that has affected the country is the result of international factors.  Fianna Fáil refuses to take responsibility or action.  The Governor of Central Bank has made it very clear that 75% of the disaster now engulfing us is directly due to Fianna Fáil policies.  There has been a serious loss of national competitiveness due to significant increases in the stacked-up costs of doing business, mostly imposed on the sector by the Government.  Worst of all, unemployment is at historically high levels.  Almost 0.5 million people are unemployed.The challenges facing the country are enormous.  Small businesses comprise the only vehicle that can kick-start job creation.  Due to Government inaction, small businesses have seen their business contracts decline by between 20% and 40%.Company insolvencies are at a record level and most enterprises going out of business are typical small businesses.  Small business owners that go out of business have no recourse to social welfare benefits or protection.  The same applies to self-employed people who have gone out of business.  They have no support whatever and are not even documented anywhere.  This represents real hardship for people who have taken pride in being active and independent contributors to the economy.  Such people have taken big risks, including mortgaging their houses, and have lost everything.  This is at an enormous personal and social cost.  We must find a solution to this.Local jobs have been lost in every town and village throughout the country.  Owing to a record jump in the numbers unemployed, thousands of people are now leaving the country.  Some 30,000 young people have left this year.  A generation of young people is gone and this is appalling.  Today's school leavers and graduates are experiencing the worst employment opportunities for decades.  Small businesses have done what they can to survive without any Government assistance.  Many are being held back from creating new jobs because of the absence of any support from the Government.  As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, the small business sector does not exist.  It is not recognised at official level.  Fianna Fáil regards the sector as a marginal player on the national economic scene.The elitist attitude of this Government is such that it believes the small business sector can survive from crumbs that fall from the top down from the multinational, exporting, high-tech, smart-economy sector.  The only results of Fianna Fáil's actions to date are unemployment, forced emigration, depressed economic activity and the closure of viable businesses.  The Fianna Fáil Government is doing nothing to assist with the retention of existing businesses and to create new jobs in the small business sector.  Fine Gael puts jobs at the centre of its economic strategy.  The problems we face demand urgent and forceful action that only Fine Gael will provide.  Fine Gael is the only party to present concrete, effective measures to protect existing jobs and create new ones.It is a tragedy that small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs — the backbone of this economy — are on the floor while this Government stands idly by.  There are some 86,000 small businesses employing approximately 650,000 people.  The small business sector can do its part to bring the State out of the present crisis through the creation of jobs at local level.  However, it can only do so if it receives the full and enthusiastic support of the Government.  As soon as Fine Gael gets the opportunity we will support small enterprise in every village and town.  The small business sector is a significant source of employment, makes a significant contribution to the national economy, is domestically oriented, makes a major contribution to Government revenue income and collects a wide range of Government taxes and charges.  Small business owners are effectively tax collectors.Small business is important to the national economy and to commercial and social life in rural Ireland.  It is an essential part of the supply chain for larger firms and a critical part of the support infrastructure needed to attract and retain foreign investment.  Small businesses form one of the largest and most significant employer groups in the country.  They provide local employment in every county, particularly at community level.  Small business also plays a key role in the national development of a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.It is time to do something about the challenges facing the small business sector.  The Government must take action in terms of credit supply, late payments, entrepreneurship and innovation, and advisory and support services for the small business sector.  The Minister has said many times that the banks are offering credit, but we all know that is not happening.  Finance is the lifeline of an enterprise and this is particularly true for the small business sector.  Restoring the flow of credit to the sector should have been at the centre of the Government's strategy.  Instead, it was largely ignored as all efforts focused on propping up a bankrupt bank.  Deputy Bruton referred to a venture capitalist bank that would support small companies with a fund of €2 billion.  ICC Bank was very effective in this regard in the past.We need a comprehensive support strategy.  Governments support banks who in turn support small business, and small business provide jobs in the local community.  To date, however, the Government — via the taxpayer — has concentrated on bankrolling the banks.  One might assume the banks would in turn support businesses, but that is not happening.  If the banks supported small businesses, they in turn would create and retain jobs.  Instead the Government has focused all the taxpayers' resources on the banks.  Today we have signed up to a further guarantee for banks that are not doing the business.We demand that a partial loan guarantee for small and medium-sized enterprises be introduced immediately.  Despite what they may say in public the banks have shut up shop and are hoarding capital.  This is putting viable SMEs under severe pressure as credit lines dry up.  Many small businesses can demonstrate commercial viability yet fail to obtain loans, typically because of issues relating to risk management.  The Government must immediately introduce a targeted SME credit initiative that will facilitate access to credit for SMEs.  The scheme must be based on the principle of risk-sharing between the State and the banks.  I do not expect such a scheme to become a substitute for commercial bank lending or to facilitate credit for companies that are not viable.  It would place Irish firms on a more level footing with international competitors.The Government should also introduce a supply chain credit guarantee facility whereby large multinational companies would jointly provide a credit guarantee with the Government for viable suppliers, partner companies and so on.  This would maintain the strength and viability of their supply chain during the downturn so that they can improve their cost competitiveness and be ready for the upturn when it comes.  It is time to think big about the potential of the small business sector.  We must get back to an innovation-driven economy, with traditional, local small business at its heart.  The economic climate is likely to drive more people toward starting their own business.  We must encourage those self starters.  Entrepreneurship and business development must be promoted as the fastest and best option for new jobs, economic growth and wealth creation.Traditional, local small businesses, whether manufacturing, tourism, retail, wholesale, construction or whatever, have the potential to create new jobs.  They must get as much attention and support as the smart economy.  Emerging industries, including health care, biotechnology, the creative industry, green energy, post-modern agriculture and aquaculture, will be sure of high priority attention when we are in government.  These segments are full of potential and Fine Gael will actively support them.As some of the larger foreign direct investment projects retrench and close, the possibility of generating spin-offs and spin-outs from these companies must receive vigorous support.   We must do more to identify sub-supply opportunities to the multinational sector for local small businesses and to work in conjunction with local third level colleges.  The entire small business start-up support system must be able to respond to the growth in demand for assistance and support, both financial and non-financial.  There are some supports and initiatives in place, but the small business sector needs a new strategy specifically aimed at the sector.  That strategy must give equal support to retaining small business and generating new business.In the current circumstances future small business retention must be the highest priority.  The loss of a small business means the loss of jobs.  There is urgent need to review the financial incentives for the small business sector and to drive new private investment in job creation through new business expansion schemes and seed capital schemes.  As part of the effort to reinvigorate and grow the small business sector, one of the highest priority tasks is to upgrade management skills and management practice in the sector.  Now is the best time to invest in management development for the small business sector.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	732	On this, our first day back after the summer recess, it is entirely appropriate that the Fine Gael Private Members' motion deals with what has become a critical unemployment situation.  We are currently facing several crises in regard to finance, banking, the health system, education and in regard to crime.  The most serious of all is the unemployment crisis where 460,000 people are out of work, the highest since records were first compiled, probably at the foundation of the State.  It is a terrible indictment of this Government and its predecessor.  This Government has allowed unemployment to escalate for the past three years until it has reached the current level.The Government's priority seems to be bailing out the banks and ensuring zombie banks are kept alive through transfusions of billions of euro with no prospect of a return.  If a percentage of that money were ploughed into job creation, the unemployment problem would not be as critical.  There is nothing that tears the heart out of a community and breaks its spirit unemployment.  There are two cohorts in our society where the huge increase in unemployment is being felt most seriously.  The first is middle aged people who have lost their jobs through redundancy when factories and businesses close.  Such people have little or no hope of finding employment for the rest of their lives.  That is a dismal prospect.  Second, and perhaps even more seriously, are the 100,000 young people under 25 years of age who are unemployed.  There are young, energetic, enthusiastic and highly qualified people throughout the State, including engineers, architects, solicitors, surveyors and so on, who are unable to find jobs.In my area I know of highly qualified engineers who have been out of work for two or three years and are heading to Australia and other areas.  Last Sunday I was at mass in a little church near Gortahork where I met several young men barely 20 years of age who will head off to Australia this week.  They told me they did not have jobs arranged but have many friends already working out there and they are more confident of securing employment there than in Donegal or anywhere else here.  The emigration of young boys and girls is breaking the spirit of communities and tearing their hearts out.  The Government has not yet woken up to the seriousness of the situation.  Fine Gael's NewEra plan which proposed the creation of 100,000 jobs was scorned and cold water was poured on it.  Lo and behold, the Government has eventually seen the light.  It pulled the rabbit out of the hat recently with its proposal to create 300,000 jobs during the next few years.  That proposal has as much credibility as had the Minister telling us last year that Anglo Irish Bank would cost us only €4.5 billion.  We await what he has to say tomorrow.The industrial base in County Donegal has been decimated.  Our traditional industries such as textiles and so on are gone.  Agriculture is at a low ebb, as is fishing, and tourism is non-existent.  These are the areas we must focus on if we are to create jobs.  The motion before us is constructive.  It contains good proposals, including abolition of the travel tax which would result in more people coming into the country thus helping the tourism industry.  Measures can be taken to assist the fishing industry and agriculture.  PRSI is a burden to the many people wishing to start up in business and employ people.  If these issues are addressed it would be a step towards addressing the serious problems we face.  The unemployment problem will break the hearts and back of this country unless it is addressed.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion.  It is entirely appropriate it is the first item on the agenda on behalf of Fine Gael on the resumption of the Dáil following the summer recess.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	733	I commend Deputy Bruton on bringing forth this motion this evening.  I wish to focus on a particular issue, namely, the travel tax.  A significant industry in the mid-west is tourism.  Levelling increased airport charges and a travel tax on passengers will not kick start our tourism industry.  Neither will it help to sustain jobs or increase passenger numbers in and out of our airports in the mid-west.  It is hard to marry the practice of fleecing potential tourists to this country with this week's announcement that 15,000 new jobs are to be created in the tourism sector by 2015.  I suspect this announcement is akin to the announcement of the €53 million economic and tourism plan, long promised for Shannon Airport but never delivered.The imposition of the €10 travel tax has been the most damaging in terms of Irish tourism.  The disastrous travel tax appears at this stage to stand as a vanity principle for the Government while all evidence in terms of its existence points to the damage it has done and will continue to do into the future.  We can see the impact these policies are having on Shannon Airport with the row back in service provision by operators such as Ryanair whose passenger throughput is expected to decline from 1.9 million passengers to 400,000 next year.Like many Members, I have been approached by business people, many over the summer.  They are being squeezed by Government and are being put out of operation owing to economic circumstances in the country.  A particular case which sticks in my mind is that of a bus company based in Shannon Airport, PK Travel, which was contracted to provide a shuttle service to people coming in and out of the airport.  The contract was a three-year one in respect of which the company invested €500,000 in the provision of buses.  However, it was withdrawn after two years without notice, resulting in 20 employees losing their jobs and the €500,000 investment in buses lying idle, with the money remaining to be repaid.  Subsequent to this, when PK Travel applied for a subsidy to help keep people employed they were told they had missed the closing date.  It beggars belief that a company would be told this, a company paying, tax, PRSI and excise duties and keeping people in the mid-west employed.  The Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, should introduce a new employment subsidy in the near future in order to keep these jobs.  I ask that the Minister respond to that point during his contribution to the debate.In regard to young people leaving Ireland, weekend nights around Ireland now involve young people sitting around in circles talking about whether to emigrate to Australia, Canada or the UK.  Some 100,000 people have already taken this option, resulting in a brain drain on our country, which must be stopped.  I want now to put in context the unemployment crisis in the mid-west.  Many of the points raised by the mid-west task force have not yet been addressed.  The only issue being addressed is that of the extension of the Limerick city boundary into County Clare.  I say to the Government and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, "Hands off County Clare".  I am seeking a statement from the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that will put the people of County Clare at ease.  This is a red herring.  It will not create any jobs.  It is an acrimonious issue and it should be put to bed.  The Government should deal with the real issues raised by the mid-west task force.  For example, it should deliver the Lynx Cargo facility, a €9 million investment, which will act as a magnet for jobs.  What we need is jobs and not rhetoric.  The Government should cease playing around with the boundaries of County Clare.

There has been much rhetoric in this Chamber today, our first day of the new Dáil session.  It is positive that we at least have some debate on the issues that actually matter.  This is, as far as I am concerned, the only issue that matters, namely, the economy, the future of our economy, quality of life for our citizens and the prospect of returning to a situation whereby we can protect and create jobs for our people thus allowing them to remain here and not be forced to emigrate or join dole queues.I pay tribute to Deputy Bruton.  Had we listened to his contributions to various budgets in 2004, 2005, 2006 and to his warnings about the decline in competitiveness in our economy and our over-inflated property bubble, we could perhaps have avoided some of the unfortunate and devastating consequences which prevail all around the country today.  I look forward to a time when Deputy Bruton will be on the other side of the House offering solutions to our economic crisis, as he does in this motion before us this evening.I will not bother speaking about the Government's so-called jobs plan because it is a fallacy.  Let us face it; it does not have any bearing or grounding in reality.  If we are honest, no one can magic up jobs.  There is no simple solution to job creation, a lesson we learned in the 1980s.  Other countries have learned that lesson through various recessions.  When one has an over-inflated Government, a Government that is wasteful and irresponsible in terms of how its spends money, a Government that is spending beyond its means, one cannot revert to competitiveness or job creation until that spending is brought under control and the conditions which allow competition to flourish and thrive are restored.Fine Gael is this evening putting forward some solutions that will go a long way to achieving that objective, including our proposal in regard to PRSI.  This is an important issue which the Government did not address in its previous two budgets.  While I acknowledge that efforts have been made to curb public expenditure and try to get a handle on the public finances, the Government has not done anything to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises, restore competitiveness or make it easier for entrepreneurs to do business.  I hope the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will make the enterprise sector a priority in the forthcoming budget.At the beginning of the recession, almost 1 million people were employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.  As Deputies are aware, this figure is declining at a rapid rate.  Unless we create conditions to assist such enterprises, job creation in the private sector will go into terminal decline.  The only way to return to economic and employment growth is to support and encourage the entrepreneurial spirit prevalent in this State.I hope the Government will address the issue of commercial rates, which are crippling business, particularly in the capital city and greater Dublin region.  I consider it immoral that, other than bin charges for waste collection, I do not pay for any services in my local area.  It is unfair and unacceptable that businesses pay for all the services from which citizens benefit.  I hope the Government will consider this issue.  I commend the motion to the House.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I congratulate Deputy Bruton and others on tabling this motion on the number one issue facing the country at this time.  Deputies on both sides should raise this issue every day in order that we can ascertain precisely how we can address the human misery unemployment causes for such a large section of the population.I went to school in the 1980s and attended college in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The terrible thing about that period was that we lost our best people, namely, the entrepreneurs and those who would naturally come to the top of any industry or profession they entered.  Invariably, these individuals did not return to Ireland, even when the economy turned around in the late 1990s.  The worst aspect of this from a social policy perspective is that the State, having made massive investment in primary, post-primary and third and fourth level education, will lose its brightest and most talented people to other parts of the world where they will help build other economies.  The ESRI suggests 100,000 of these young people have already left our shores.Two weeks ago, I spoke at the autumn conferrings in Cork which were attended by 600 highly talented people, most of whom had just completed four year degree courses.  It is reckoned that if one does not work within two years of completing a four year degree, one loses the skills and experience acquired during one's studies.  I plead with the Government, through this motion and the arguments we have made, to put in place something tangible for the 50,000 young people who graduated from college this year and are competing for jobs on the labour market with graduates from the previous year and perhaps earlier.  These young people do not have any prospect of securing jobs.We need a radical policy under which at least 20,000 places would be offered in the public and private sectors as part of a graduate recruitment scheme.  The Government has produced three schemes which in sum total provide 1,700 places at a time of rampant youth unemployment, especially among graduates.  We must keep young people in the economy.  I do not suggest a graduate employment scheme would not cost money.  Between €200 million and €250 million would be required for a graduate allowance to keep these young people in Ireland for two years.  The Government should not tell me we do not have opportunities to achieve this objective in local authorities, the Civil Service, small and medium-sized enterprises and schools.  Spending money on a graduate recruitment scheme would give young people an opportunity to stay in this country.  Something big, bold and ambitious is required to allow large numbers of young people to remain here.Despite all of the gloom, we must remember that 1.8 million people are still at work in the economy, virtually double the figure of ten years ago.  It is crucial, therefore, that we have a strategy to protect all of those who are still in work.  This will require removing red tape, bureaucrats and other elements which stand in the way of creating and sustaining jobs.  Our primary national objective must be to sustain every single job.  We must protect jobs, rather than standing in the way of job creation.As I travel around the country, I often hear small business people describe an obsessive culture among public servants in State agencies which stands in the way of job creation and protection.  This is the most important task ahead if we are to turn the country around, give hope and ensure we do not have another lost generation, as we had in the 1980s.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	736	I move amendment No. 2:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"—supports fully the actions and policies of the Government designed to restore sustainable economic growth and job creation capacity to the economy as soon as possible, through:safeguarding the future of the banking system as a provider of credit to viable enterprises in the State;pursuing policies to ensure restoration of overall economic competitiveness including reducing the cost of doing business and taking action to reform the public sector to secure a more efficient and cost competitive delivery of public services;planning a sustainable and achievable reduction in public spending to contain the increase in the burden of taxation that would otherwise arise and which would hamper job creation in the future;preserving a low tax regime on companies and business to attract foreign enterprise and jobs;providing a capital stimulus package of nearly €40 billion over the next six years which will fund infrastructure projects to support about 30,000 jobs each year for the next six years;helping to sustain over 100,000 jobs by providing financial support to over 1,700 companies through the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund;implementing an employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme to support job creation and counter the drift of people into long-term unemployment and which is expected to create up to 10,000 new jobs;establishing the €500 million Innovation Fund to support entrepreneurs so that they can create jobs; andincreasing the number of training places for the unemployed to over 180,000 so that they have the skills to access the 96,000 vacancies forecasted to arise each year on average up to 2014;welcomes, in particular, the Government's five year integrated trade, tourism and investment plan, Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, designed to increase the value of indigenous exports by 33%; to diversify the destination of indigenous exports; to increase overseas visitors to 8 million; to secure an additional 780 inward investment projects through the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) Ireland and create up to 300,000 sustainable jobs across the economy."I propose to share time with Deputies Seán Fleming, Margaret Conlon and Michael Kennedy.I move the amendment on behalf of the Government and welcome the opportunity to respond to the motion presented by the Fine Gael Party.  More precisely, I utterly reject the motion tabled by Members opposite.  The calls they make demonstrate a lack of knowledge of our infrastructural investment programme, PRSI incentive scheme, strategy to increase tourist numbers, action to increase credit flow to the productive economy, policy driven improved national competitiveness, expansion of training places and increased support for entrepreneurs.Most of all, the Fine Gael Party has demonstrated a partisan inability to recognise and endorse the comprehensive and coherent job strategy devised by the Government in Infrastructure Investment Priorities 2010-2016 and the Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy strategy.I propose first to address the most erroneous of the charges made by the Opposition, namely, that the Government has failed to present a coherent jobs strategy.  This is plainly incorrect.  There is ample evidence of the significant action that has been taken across the whole government system to address the challenges faced by the economy.  Our action has concentrated on taking steps over the past two years to address three key issues, namely, sorting out the banking crisis, placing the public finances on a path to recovery and tackling our cost competitiveness.  All three issues are essential foundations for job creation and job maintenance.The Fine Gael Party implies there is some single policy or intervention that will return our economy to high employment and sustainable enterprise growth.  That is not the case and it is the reason the Government is working on a multifaceted approach focusing on jobs and growth.  The Government's response is a realistic one which puts first things first by consolidating the fiscal position, supporting our banks as future providers of capital, keeping up substantial capital spending as an investment in future jobs, regaining competitiveness by appropriate price and wage policies, supporting jobs in the SME sector, stabilising the economy and supporting the export sector by pro-business tax policies.This is the cornerstone of the coherent foreign trade and investment plan published yesterday to secure a 300,000 increase in jobs in the next five years.  These are jobs at all skill levels, in all sectors of the economy and in every county.  From the local corner shop, bookshops, bed and breakfasts, retailers, garages, printers, packers, hauliers, IT specialists, manufacturers and supervisors to CEOs, a smart economy delivers job opportunities in all these areas.  This is something our critics must understand.The Government is positioning Ireland to be successful in selling our goods and services abroad, winning global investment and attracting visitors from around the world.  Our plan will help Irish farmers and firms expand their market share overseas and will boost food exports.  Export-led growth is the right strategy.  Supporting export-led growth is our job strategy.Labour's strategy is simply to borrow and build.  Fine Gael's strategy is unknown even to itself. This is fine when you are in Opposition. The Government, on the other hand, is setting clear, ambitious targets to be achieved over the next five years.To reach our targets we need, of course, to start growing again.  This week's official figures show strong growth in exports by Irish companies in the first eight months of this year.  Enterprise Ireland companies will recover approximately 70% of the export earnings that were lost last year.  Exports are up 8% between June and July and our trade surplus is up 29% to €4 billion.  This strong performance is helped by the international engagements of this Government in our important trading markets.  I regret the fact that this work is not valued or appreciated by the Leader of the Opposition, this being evident from his recent efforts to block an important ministerial trade mission to the US.Notwithstanding the fiscal constraints, we are delivering what is still one of the most  substantial capital investment programmes in the OECD.   We will invest nearly €40 billion by the end of 2016.  As well as supporting 30,000 direct construction jobs in the economy every year, it will also deliver valuable infrastructure in new roads, public transport, schools and research facilities.  It will also help homes and businesses reduce their long-term energy costs through the retrofit programme.The Fine Gael motion bemoans inaction to encourage entrepreneurship.  This is incredible.  Entrepreneurship continues to thrive in this country despite the challenges presented by both the global and domestic economic environments.  This has been verified by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor reports that show that entrepreneurs starting businesses as a percentage of the population is 4.3% in Ireland, compared to just 2.7% across the EU and 2.9% in the UK.   The rate of established entrepreneurs in Ireland is one of the highest across the OECD.  The businessmen and women who establish and drive enterprise in Ireland, have played, and will continue to play, a central role in our future economic advancement.Over the past decade, the Government has made significant investment in developing the broader environment for start-ups.  This has included substantial investment in incubators, seed and venture funds, angel networks and mentors.  Enterprise Ireland has supported between 50 and 70 start-ups each year over the past decade.  We aim to increase this to 100 start ups a year by 2016.The increased funding for enterprise under the Government's capital programme will provide for the establishment of a €500 million innovation fund as well as more funding for seed and venture capital and angel funds.  Innovation Fund Ireland brings a new dimension to our existing venture capital sector and will allow more innovative ideas to become commercial realities in an improved competitive environment.The annual competitiveness report, published by the National Competitiveness Council, is interesting.  It acknowledged that since January 2008, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost at the start of the global economic downturn.  The improvement in competitiveness is closely linked to the policies the Government has pursued to restore stability to the economy.  Some of the indicators of improved competitiveness can be seen in the fact that inflation remains below that of our main trading partners.  We are seeing lower costs for business, particularly in areas such as energy and rental of prime industrial space and office space.  Thirty three local authorities have either frozen their commercial rates at 2009 prices or reduced them for 2010.  Wage costs have also reduced across the economy.Despite this recent improvement, we are determined to do more. We are reducing the administrative burden by driving better regulation.  Some €20 million in savings for business have already been achieved through cutting out paperwork, revising the rules for small businesses and making better use of on-line services.  We aim to achieve €500 million in savings by 2012.   Priority is being given to reducing the administrative burdens in the three key areas of company law, health and safety, and employment legislation.Local authority charges remain a concern to the business sector and we will progress the recommendations of the recent efficiency review of the local authority system, to secure savings, which will further reduce pressure on business and ensure we can sustain and create jobs.  I can assure the House that measures to further reduce costs to business will feature along side our policies to reduce the deficit and drive public sector reform.A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Opposition motion mentions a number of specific proposals on PRSI, credit for SMEs, the Competitiveness Council, removing red tape and updating bankruptcy law.  Well, just in case those over there have missed it, this Government has already introduced a PRSI exemption scheme for new jobs; a Credit Review Office to increase credit to SMEs; is committed to improving competitiveness; is making progress on culling red tape and has brought forward measures on bankruptcy in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.On credit for small business, I particularly welcome the results of the recent ISME survey, which shows an improvement in access to bank credit for small businesses in the period from June to August.  Some 58% of companies had accessed credit compared to 45% in the previous quarter.  This is a very welcome improvement and will allow these companies to sustain and grow employment.The role of the Government is not to directly create jobs.  Our job is to ensure that the enterprise environment is optimal, so that enterprises can establish, grow and thrive, leading to the growth of Irish exports and the creation of sustainable jobs.  The Government's economic strategy will enable us to go forward as a more competitive economy with a sustainable and innovative enterprise base.  This Government has put and continues to put jobs and growth at the centre of our economic strategy.  Our efforts have yielded results to date.The Opposition can peddle its negativity all it wants.  This is not a jobs strategy.  The Opposition's sniping will not help one person get off the dole queue.  Its populist outrage will not help a single Irish firm sell its products abroad.  Its griping will not help Ireland win a single investment project.  Nor will it attract one extra visitor to Ireland.The Government is focused on delivering its jobs strategy and taking the right, tough decisions.  That is how we will create employment, drive export growth, win more international investment and boost tourist numbers.  For that reason, I commend the Government's motion to the House.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I welcome the opportunity of supporting the proposal put forward by the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, which supports the Government's action to bring sustainable economic growth and job creation capacity to the economy as soon as possible.It would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that the live register figures for September 2010, which were published a few hours ago, show the biggest single drop ever in the live register in any one month.  I know there are pluses and minuses in those figures.  However, there are 24,506 fewer people on the unemployment live register today than at the end of last month.In January and February of last year, which I would call two black months, unemployment increased by 30,000 in each.  The figures stabilised to a significant extent in the intervening 18 months but it is good to see a tangible and real reduction at this stage.  This is very welcome and very important.  Of the 442,000 on the live register, 293,000 are in receipt of payment for a full week and 62,000 are in receipt of payment for part of a week.  It is important to acknowledge the existence of these part-time workers, lest it be assumed that 442,000 people are unemployed for a full week.  This is not the case.I am most concerned that approximately 150,000 of those on the live register are in the 25 to 34 age group.  They are new young working families and are in a very difficult situation.  We must make assisting them a priority.A number of activation programmes have been put in place and 9,000 people are currently on back-to-work payments, primarily through the back-to-work allowance scheme.  An additional 20,000 people are on community employment schemes and a further 5,000 recently commenced vocational training opportunity schemes, VTOS, which are run by the various VECs throughout the country.  The latter schemes are much appreciated by those who obtain places on them.The Government has put in place some concrete initiatives in recent times to assist with the creation and protection of employment.  First, it changed the rules with regard to public procurement and in respect of those who tender for public contracts.  These changes will make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to tender for contracts.  Many such businesses were previously excluded from tendering as a result of turnover requirements.  The Government has gone further by trying to break some large contracts into smaller, more manageable contracts to which not as much foreign competition will be attracted.  We will be able to give to Irish businesses these contracts which relate to products and services that are required and that will be paid for by the taxpayer through Government procurement sources.I will highlight one figure I wish to see reversed.  The initiative I have outlined will assist in that regard.  Approximately 99% of all government contracts across the EU are taken up by companies in the countries where such are put out to tender.  In Ireland, the figure is 18%.  Essentially, and relative to the position in other EU countries, we opened the door far too wide and allowed too many foreign contractors to take up contracts here.  We should move towards the EU average and design contracts in such a way as to ensure that companies here that tender for the business will be successful.  We have begun this long-overdue process, which, I am sure, will be of assistance.The Government spends approximately €4 billion on unemployment payments.  Such payments should be matched with trying to retain people in employment.  The employment subsidy scheme, which is excellent, is one example in this regard.  I would like the funding available under this scheme to be quadrupled.  We must take the necessary steps to redesign the scheme to facilitate subsidised employment and to ensure that Brussels will not object to what we are doing.  I guarantee Members that the French, the Italians and the English would be able to do that which I have outlined.  We have been overly politically correct in too many instances.  All one need do is travel to other countries to see how they operate within EU rules to benefit themselves first and foremost.  We must be selfish when it comes to matters of this nature.In the area of construction, I would like to see the introduction of tax relief for home improvements that would be subjected to a limit.  A relief of 20% could be given to people who add extensions worth perhaps €50,000 or €100,000 to their homes provided they could produce receipts showing that the work was carried out by a registered tax-compliant contractor.  This would bring people back into the legitimate economy.  In a recession, quite a number of people tend to move into the black and grey economies.  Such a relief scheme would make matters much easier for legitimate contractors and would encourage people to spend some money, particularly if they knew that they would receive some of their tax back.  Due to the fact that it would generate activity, a scheme of this nature would be self-financing.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate on this motion, particularly in light of the Government's five-year integrated trade, tourism and investment plan that was announced yesterday.  In launching the plan, the Government clearly stated that its aim is to secure 300,000 jobs in the next five years.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who stated that export-led growth is the solution.  Such growth is the cure and it will ensure that the targets that have been laid down will be met.The new plan illustrates the Government's commitment to job creation.  However, before one job can be created, the conditions for investment must be right.  We spent a great deal of time earlier discussing the need to have a properly-functioning banking system.  That is one of the prerequisites to job creation.  The ultimate determination relating to the cost of Anglo Irish Bank will emerge in the coming days and this will bring about certainty, finality and stability.The public finances must also be stabilised.  Again, the Government is committed to doing this.  We have taken some very tough measures and made several harsh decisions.  However, it is obvious that a system under which we spend €5 for every €3 we take in is not sustainable.  If the banks are not functioning properly and if the public finances are not stable, then the conditions necessary for job creation will not be present.  This is a matter upon which we are working.As a small, open economy on the fringes of Europe, Ireland needs to export.  Brand Ireland is, therefore, hugely important and most essential to our recovery.  We need to explore all available opportunities to further increase exports.  I refer, in this regard, to the export of goods and services.  I do not know if anyone else saw a debate shown on TV3 late last night during which an economic journalist berated the Government for promoting tourism.  She stated that no one comes here in any event and inquired why there is so much discussion with regard to tourism creating jobs.  We should focus on indigenous industries.  If tourism is not such an industry, what is?  If we are to be treated to the kind of unbalanced commentary to which I refer, then we will certainly not get the right message across.We aim to increase visitor numbers.  Visitors come here and they spend money.  We have a great deal to offer but if the media is not balanced and does not promote a positive image of the country, we will find ourselves in trouble.  In my constituency, the Ulster Canal, when it is fully opened up, will offer great potential and there is also Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann, which is extremely successful.  These are but two small examples of attractions which have brought high numbers of people into the constituency.  We may not have good weather but we certainly have the jewels in the crown and these must be exploited.As the previous speaker indicated, there was a decrease in the number of people on the live register during this month.  That is good news and it shows that  stabilisation has occurred.  However, the figures are still too high.  Job creation must continue to be our central focus.  I agree with Deputy Brian Hayes who stated that we must protect and sustain existing jobs, create new jobs for graduates and reduce the number of people on the live register.  I also agree with his assertion that almost 1.9 million people are in employment.  This hugely important fact must not be forgotten.The daily newspapers make for depressing reading.  They are preoccupied with bad news and negativity.  There are many small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country which are making tremendous efforts to create jobs.  In my constituency several weeks ago, the Shabra Group opened a new extension and created 35 jobs.  This story was newsworthy enough to encourage any television channel to send a camera crew to cover the story.  I guarantee that if a factory had been closing and if 35 jobs were lost, a queue of camera crews eager to relay the bad news would have been present.  When I made a comment during an interview on national radio about the importance of the jobs to which I refer, the presenter of the programme on which I appeared told me to get a grip of myself because only 35 jobs had been created.  As far as I am concerned, the creation of one job is of major importance.  The creation of 35 is extremely significant.  Those who are taking risks, showing initiative and creating jobs are not being given the publicity they deserve.Deputies referred to the need to create confidence in the economy and to encourage people to spend.  Negative commentary will do nothing to assist in the realisation of either of these goals.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important motion.  I support the Government amendment to it.A great deal has happened during the past week.  The Government brought together the various State agencies to ensure that they are focused on driving forward during the next four to five years to ensure that the maximum number of jobs will be created.  Deputy Brian Hayes referred to the 1.8 million people in employment.  It is vital that we ensure that those people's jobs are protected and sustained.  The Government took steps in recent years, in the context of PRSI, the stabilisation fund, and so on, to provide assistance to companies in their quest to retain jobs.The decision on the part of Fine Gael to try to stop the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills from travelling to the United States was highly regrettable.  It shows up Fine Gael as being very short-sighted.  The Tánaiste's trip is promotional in nature and will take her to destinations across the US.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	740	Let us see how many jobs come out of it.  Time will tell.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The Boston Chamber of Commerce boasts that each week it hosts a government minister from some country or other.  Here we had an opportunity where the Government with great ties to the US was going to be denied the opportunity to send our Minister to help promote Ireland with Enterprise Ireland.  I sincerely hope that will not happen again.The IDA Ireland targets are achievable and with focus there is no reason we cannot seek out new markets in China, India and other Far East countries.  We should get those countries with great financial resources to invest here in high technology industry given the skilled people we have.  There is no reason Ireland as a food exporting nation cannot again build on the trade missions to China and other places in recent years and increase our exports.While we often hear the negativity, in my constituency of Dublin North over the past seven to eight months more than 1,400 new jobs have been created.  I commend IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland for that achievement.  I would like to think that the Dublin North region is very strategic with the airport, motorways etc.  Ireland has something to offer and with the right determination we can achieve those jobs.Many speakers have mentioned tourism where creating 15,000 new jobs is realistic.  While we have challenges in promoting the country, the 2012 Olympic Games in London represents a great opportunity both next year and obviously in 2012 to get our share of the market.  All those foreign visitors will be 45 minutes away by air or two hours away by ferry.  If our tourist groups — hotels, airlines, restaurants etc. — get together and offer good packages, I do not doubt that we can get a significant share of that market.  In referring to tourism, I mention the fantastic new facility in Dublin North — the new terminal at Dublin Airport, which is a really iconic building.  I ask those who knock it, including one particular gentleman of a famous airline who continually berates it, to go out and see it.  It is a fantastic building that offers the modern facilities that every traveller wants.  As a Deputy who represents the area I am certainly very proud of it.A constituent recently contacted me on a matter on which I will make contact with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  2011 will be the 100th anniversary of the 1911 census.  This constituent has written to all his overseas cousins and other relations, inviting them back to their ancestors' birthplace in Connemara in his particular case.  There is an opportunity for each of us in our own small way to look at that census and ascertain who lived in our ancestors' homes and track down all the cousins, nieces, nephews etc. and invite them back.  There would be a great opportunity for major celebrations in 2011.The Government is on the right track.  In terms of consumer confidence, with €80 billion in savings in banks, if 2.5% of that money were spent by consumers, it would be equivalent to a €2 billion annual spend, which would be a major boost.  I suggest to everybody in this Chamber and outside that we should talk up the economy rather than talking it down.  If we give people that little bit of confidence to want to spend, our country would be better for it.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	744	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party to this important motion which we in the Labour Party broadly support and which has as its core objective the placing of job creation as the main priority of Government policy.  We would have some concerns about the reference to the widespread utilisation of the National Pensions Reserve Fund in an unlimited way and the inclusion in an undefined way of the sale of non-strategic assets where it is suggested that they should be sold to generate funds for job creation.  Having privatised some of our State industries, we should be wary of further widespread privatisation which may result in short-term gains at the expense of long-term losses.A group under the chairmanship of the ubiquitous Colm McCarthy is carrying out a review of what State assets should be sold.  The review is clearly a prelude to selling off what remains of the semi-State sector in order to improve the public finances.  Having mortgaged our futures and those of our grandchildren in order to pay the debts of the casino gamblers, the Government is now like a desperate gambler willing to sell the family silver to fund a last throw of the dice.The announcement of that review peculiarly came on the day that Eircom announced it was seeking 1,200 job cuts.  Eircom stands as a monument to the failure of the Government's privatisation policy.  After overvaluing the company and overselling shares in it, the Government could only look on helplessly as Eircom became a plaything for profit making at a number of stages by various individuals and a private equity company.  As Eircom was eviscerated and loaded with debt, it had no funds to invest in upgrading its broadband provision which has left Ireland with one of the poorest levels of broadband penetration in Europe.  The Government's talk of creating a smart economy rings somewhat hollow to those who are trying to run small businesses in rural areas with inadequate broadband as a result of the Government's policy and actions at that time.When President Sarkozy came to power in France, he had intended to sell several of France's very successful state companies.  When the banking crisis and its associated recession hit France, he quietly abandoned his plans as he realised that a large and vibrant state sector was a valuable asset to a nation when significant numbers of jobs were lost in the private sector.We in the Labour Party have proposed over the past year, as has been set out in our amendment to the Fine Gael motion, the establishment of a strategic investment bank to fund viable businesses around the country and invest in strategic infrastructure projects, enabling the bringing forward of coherent sectional strategies in areas such as tourism, food, clean tech and the creative industries.  This should have a focus on the reinvigoration of the State agencies, including the county and city enterprise boards, which are extremely important in the context of micro-enterprises.  We should ensure the provision of high-speed broadband throughout the country and give greater priority to support for applied research to support the commercialisation of new knowledge.Our proposal involves the establishment of the strategic investment bank, using €2 billion of funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund before it is all lost by Fianna Fáil in casino gambling.  This would leverage €20 billion and that money would then be directed towards job creation proposals in the manner I have outlined.  I would also support a proposal from the Construction Industry Federation and ICTU that an infrastructure fund be established.  I heard the Taoiseach say today that the National Pensions Reserve Fund is for commercial investment.  Notwithstanding my dislike for tolled roads, why was it not allowed to invest in tolled roads which have been constructed under public private partnership, where private companies from other countries get all the revenues and the State bears all the risks?  Here was a sure way of ensuring the pension provision for our citizens who contribute to it would increase.  However, when we made that proposal I remember the Fianna Fáil PR spin merchants sent its Deputies out to berate us from on high.  How times have changed given how the Government has raided the National Pensions Reserve Fund at will without getting any return.In July when we last debated the important issue of unemployment here in the House, I proposed that the Government introduce an SME loan guarantee scheme — the Government claims we have no policy in this area — but unbelievably nothing has happened in the interim in this area.  Such a scheme would make an important contribution to assist small businesses and companies get key credit and cash flow.  Small and family businesses across the country cannot get the loans they need to keep the show on the road.  Paying wages and suppliers is a struggle.  Viable, profitable, well run businesses are going to the wall because they cannot access credit.  Two years on from the introduction of the blanket guarantee, our banking system is still in crisis.  We were promised that the guarantee, NAMA and the recapitalisation would get credit flowing, but our banks remain critically undercapitalised and risk averse.I have been calling for the introduction of a SME working capital guarantee scheme for a considerable period of time and on the last occasion I outlined systematically how it might operate.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation should explore options for this scheme in order to help address the small business credit famine and help save jobs.  These jobs in small businesses in every town and village across the country are the backbone of the economy.  It is no use paying lip-service to this.  Real and positive action is required to ensure they will continue to be the backbone of the economy.  Similar schemes are operated successfully in the UK, Japan and Hong Kong, among others.  Why is there a reluctance to introduce such a scheme here?  I do not want to hear any more guff out of Members on the Government benches claiming the Labour Party does not have ideas.  What is wrong with this proposal we have introduced?  Today the Taoiseach told the Labour Party leader, Deputy Gilmore, that he was prepared to look at constructive proposals from the Opposition.  That was a blatant lie.  Every time we put forward a proposal, he finds some way of criticising it.  I want a critical and proper evaluation of these proposals rather than the Taoiseach's lip-service, disdain and curling of his lip.What is envisaged is a co-guarantee, risk-sharing scheme where the banks themselves make the lending decision but the Government steps in to guarantee 50% to 75% of the loan.  The beauty of such an arrangement is that there is an alignment of interests between the loan originator and the guarantor.Where the bank's capital is under pressure, as is the case with all our commercial lending banks, the presence of such a guarantee would reduce the level of its risk-weighted assets and, by extension, the level of capital it would need to retain on its balance sheets to back those loans.  As all the banks concerned are short of capital, the deadweight loss is minimal while additionality is potentially significant.  Again, the expected loss on these loans through bad loans would be likely to amount to less than 5%.  The volume of loans, therefore, that could be supported through such a guarantee would be significant with the State maximising its bang for its buck.If ever there were an indictment of the apathy with which the Government has treated the important issue of unemployment and the necessity to sustain and retain jobs, it can be found in the ham-fisted attempts to bring in the employers PRSI job incentive scheme.  It promised up to 10,000 jobs but to date only 629 successful applications have been approved.  As my colleague Deputy Shortall has ascertained, at this rate of progress only about 2,000 of the 10,000 promised jobs will have been created by the time the scheme is scheduled to be wound down at the end of the year.  When it was announced in last December's budget, €36 million was set aside for jobs created in 2010 while it was indicated that employers could expect a saving of an average of €3,000 each.  However, it took six months before the scheme commenced in June this year.  Will this initiative be extended into 2011, as it is at least revenue neutral while providing a stimulus to employment?

It has record levels of mass unemployment and all the social decay that brings.  It was ironic to hear a reference to the Irish diaspora in yesterday's announcement of job creation by the Government.  The Government is certainly contributing to its growth by presiding over another era of large scale emigration.The motion refers to the fact the recession in Ireland is far deeper and more prolonged than in any other EU member state.  The reason behind this is directly related to issues around the State's bank guarantee and the NAMA debacle.  The State has been virtually dragged to its knees by a small number of incompetent and greedy financial and property speculators.  A so-called "golden circle" was able to gamble recklessly on the future of the Irish economy simply because of their political connections and political protection.They have been likened to the old landlord class which lived like parasites off this country until the end of the 19th century.  Likewise, the financial and property speculators of today contributed nothing to economic growth except to exploit the need for housing and accommodation.  They also gambled overseas on the basis that they could borrow huge sums from Irish banks.  These are the same banks that now refuse credit to legitimate Irish businesses and charge dubious fees to their regular customers who find it hard enough to pay their own way without having to pick up the tab for the Anglo Irish Bank disaster.  The rest of us are forced into a situation where we are supposed to accept the dragging down of a whole society in order to pay for the criminal incompetence of these people.  It is no wonder people are angry.Over 450,000 people are on the live register, bringing the standardised unemployment rate to 13.7%.  As these figures threaten to reach half a million people, even with rising emigration, the Government's focus remains on the future of a bank with no prospects but ignorant of the future of people with endless prospects.Unemployment is the true gauge of economic success.  These labour market figures tell their own story.  The Government only suddenly discovered the jobs crisis last week.  The Taoiseach organised a public session with the heads of all State jobs agencies for the first time since he took office.  The public relations machine may have been in full swing but the cogs that actually create jobs are still rusty.  The Government has also announced other such job creation schemes in the past.  If the number of jobs it announced in the past year materialised, there would be no unemployment and a shortage of labour.The success of its recent plan hinges on the Government's resolve and ability to keep job creation and enterprise development to the fore of the economic agenda.  This involves more than just launching a plan.  It involves investment and putting in resources to see the plan through.  However, the Government will fall down on this and the job creation plan risks being shelved as just another public relations stunt.Not only are we thrust into having massive structural deficits caused by an unchecked property crisis, but drastic spending cuts are throttling the domestic economy.  The deflationary economic trend is disastrous for the public finances as it erodes current taxation levels while the debt burden rises.  This austerity Government is failing while unemployment is soaring.  People cannot afford day-to-day living and businesses cannot get access to credit, thereby creating more unemployment and emigration.  That is the only policy the Government has.The financial markets are not rewarding austerity but the opposite.  As the State has introduced a bank guarantee and Anglo Irish Bank is nationalised, investors are assessing Ireland and its banking system as one.  The State's sovereign debt has become tied to our banking institutions.  The most recent increases in interest rates on Irish State bonds were directly linked to the uncertainty surrounding Anglo Irish Bank and Ireland's ability to pay its debts.What is needed is a job creation policy with funding provided to small businesses to help them survive and to be able to take on more employees.

Economic strategy and how we get the country out of its crisis is the question of the day.  The Government has again, however, turned away from an economic solution.  Earlier the House voted on continuing the same policy of the past two years concerning a blanket bank guarantee.  The Government forced through a motion to extend that blanket guarantee to the banking institutions that have failed this economy, the banking institutions that brought us to our knees, that will not lend to small and medium enterprises and that will not provide a credit flow.  The taxpayer has been asked to bail out all of these institutions, with €24 billion going to Anglo Irish Bank, €8 billion to Irish Nationwide and recapitalisation for the Bank of Ireland and AIB Bank.Taxpayers' money is like confetti as far as the Government is concerned when it is used to bail out the banks and to fill the black hole in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is outrageous.  It is the focus of the Government, it is what it has done for the past two years and now it is telling us it will be extended for another three months and longer if necessary.  When that is the mindset of a Government, how will we ever get out of the economic crisis?If there is any money in the coffers, where should it go?  To job retention and creation, to reskilling to move the economy on and to provide economic confidence for consumers.We saw the CSO figures at the start of the month, which showed the road haulage business, an economic barometer for economic activity within the country as distinct from foreign direct investment exports, was down by 40%, a colossal reduction.  That is the real barometer of the slide in economic activity, with 13.7% of the population on the live register, even with the slight adjustment for September, when there is always a seasonal improvement.In the past two years, 100,000 people have emigrated, bringing us back to the 1980s and the 1950s.  Those leaving are the ones we would expect to provide the impetus in the smart economy about which the Government is forever talking.  Instead they will go to the four corners of the earth, to Australia, the USA, Britain and some of them to Asia where they will have job opportunities in economies that recognise the value of their education and talent.  That is not the way forward.The first thing the Government must do is decide its priorities.  Does it want to bail out a failed banking system with an unlimited guarantee or to focus the resources of the country and skills of its people on trying to get the economy running again?  The Minister should realise that there is only one priority — the small and medium enterprise sector.  Half of all employment in the country is in that sector, with 65% of private employment in it, yet it is crying out for credit.  SMEs cannot secure loans, even overdrafts are few and far between.There is an almost unlimited pot of money in the European Investment Bank, €30 billion, for our banks to invest in new small and medium enterprises but it is not happening.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13811	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	763	On 9 August, when the Dáil was in recess, HIQA announced an investigation into ongoing services at Mallow General Hospital.  Tonight I want to put forward the views of those I represent who have a particular interest in the investigation and who felt strongly that it was spurious and unnecessary.The investigation was announced on the basis of a specific complaint about procedures from someone at the hospital.  We now know that was not the case, and know there was no specific incident related to the treatment of a person.  We also know the investigation arose from the fact that in April 2009, HIQA published the report of the investigation into the quality and safety or services in Ennis, that there would be recommendations arising from that, and that a report would follow for Mallow, which was a similar hospital but that had never been put forward by the HSE.  It was on foot of that alone that HIQA decided to go into Mallow General Hospital.The process at present is that HIQA has met representatives of the hospital and the staff and is continuing its investigations.  The staff at the hospital operate in constrained circumstances and are punching above their weight.  In June, after many years of campaigning, an executive management board was finally put in place.  The hospital is under the auspices of CUH but for years it was left on its own, devoid of support from the larger hospital.I will bet money that when the report is published, it will clearly show that the staff and personnel at the hospital have delivered, in spite of the HSE bearing down on them while refusing to put in place adequate funding.  This report will vindicate the doctors, nurses and other staff in the hospital by showing they are in no way negligent and are doing more than they should to deliver services.  It will also show that management structures were inadequate and the HSE never properly resourced the administrative function at the hospital, which led to inadequacies in terms of reporting procedures.  It will also show that CUH never adequately recognised Mallow for the facility it is as part of its operation.I want to point out that the staff support the hospital and maintain that services can be modified.  They are willing to work with the HSE to achieve that and doctors, nurses and staff will buy into the change management process.  We do not want to see a reduced service facility, however, or to see the hospital's capacity being sacrificed on the HSE's altar of cost efficiency.  This is key because we will modify services but we must not reduce capacity.  We can deliver the services within the hospital but we must be given the opportunity to do so.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising the question.Patient safety is central to the delivery of health services and people must have confidence in the care they receive and have the best possible outcomes.  The overwhelming consensus among clinical experts, as seen in cancer care, is that patients have demonstrably better outcomes where complex care is delivered with the necessary staff and equipment and with sufficient volumes of activity.  The evidence also emphasises the need to provide timely emergency care to patients in an appropriate setting.Achieving better outcomes for patients will require hospitals to change the services they deliver to their communities and how those are delivered.  Reconfiguration of acute services in the Cork and Kerry area will produce improved services.  The clinical benefits for patients will be significant and the treatment offered will be of the highest standard.  The Minister and the HSE recognise the importance of Mallow General Hospital and the contribution it has made, and will continue to make, to the provision of hospital services in the region.The HSE has not yet finalised its proposals for the future reconfiguration of the region's hospitals.  In August 2010, HIQA announced an investigation into the quality and safety of services in Mallow General Hospital.  The authority had identified concerns about the types of patients being treated, centred on major surgery, emergency and critical care services.The purpose of the investigation is to ascertain whether safe, quality services and practices are in place and to ensure that, where there may be a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving a service, such risks are identified and recommendations made with a view to eliminating or reducing risks for patients.  In line with the terms of reference, the authority's review will include measures at local, regional, corporate and national level to implement the national recommendations in the authority's 2009 Ennis report; current arrangements for management and provision of clinical services in Mallow to minimize risks to patient safety, including critical and acute care and anaesthetic, surgical and emergency services; and local, regional, corporate and national clinical and managerial governance arrangements for safe care and transition to new service provision models.  The authority will publish its report and recommendations following the completion of the investigation.Finally, the Minister wishes to emphasise that she rejects any claim that the HIQA investigation is spurious as suggested in the text of the Deputy's question.  HIQA is an independent statutory body that makes its own decisions about what investigations to carry out and in what way.  The process will be entirely independent and there will be no pre-judgment of the outcome.  The investigation will deal not solely with Mallow, but will also look at the wider context of acute hospital services in the region.  The Minister supports the decision by HIQA to carry out an investigation and she believes that it will be to the benefit of service quality for patients.  I am satisfied that the outcome of these processes will lead to a strengthening of the quality and safety of acute hospital services for people in the Cork and Kerry region and will ensure that they have access to health services that comply with best practice in the right facilities and in a timely manner.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	765	Kerry Airport is one of the main drivers of the County Kerry economy.  Some 148 people are employed at the airport, 66 of whom are employed directly, a further 84 in car hire and taxi services and the bar and restaurant franchise and a further 30 are Ryanair staff.  It also supports thousands of jobs in the county where the live register for August shows unemployment at 16,029 or 17% of the workforce.  Last Thursday the people of Kerry were shocked when Ryanair announced its withdrawal of the PSO contractual obligation it entered into with the Minister and the reduction in flights from Kerry to Dublin from three to one.  If the current PSO payment of €1.75 million, which goes directly into the running of the airport, is withdrawn the airport's future viability will be seriously compromised.According to a comprehensive response to the Department of Transport on the operation of the PSO at Kerry airport by Dr. Sean Barrett, if the airport was to close the social welfare payments per year for the staff made redundant would be €2.585 million, which is 48% more than the PSO payment of €1.75 million per year.  Dr. Barrett also pointed out that 432,000 passengers who use Kerry Airport currently pay €1.9 million to €2 million in airport tax.  The €10 tax is paid by 148,000 departing passengers to the United Kingdom, Germany, sun destinations and ad hoc overseas charters, resulting in Exchequer revenues of €1.48 million.  The passengers on the Dublin-Kerry route pay €2 departure tax at both Kerry and Dublin, yielding Exchequer revenues in excess of €500,000.  The airport taxes paid on Kerry trips are thus 14% greater than the amount paid in the PSO to Kerry Airport.The value for money report carried out by the Department of Transport on regional airports in regard to PSOs, which I am aware will be considered by the Government shortly, will show that Kerry Airport is in a very good position as regards value for money.  In 2009, outbound flights from Kerry to Dublin facilitated 56,000 passengers.  The new arrangement proposed by Ryanair would result in just one flight from Kerry to Dublin each day, leaving Kerry at 9.45 a.m and returning at 4.45 p.m.  If one wants to travel from Dublin to Kerry to do business or for any other purpose by air it could result in two overnights in Kerry unless one has an early morning meeting at the airport.The possible closure of Kerry Airport reduces its connectivity, not just on the United Kingdom and German routes but to Dublin and onward connections through Dublin.  From Dublin and the connecting points Kerry would become a significantly more remote place, with enhanced accessibility costs.  When people decide to stay away from Kerry and relocate their business and tourism elsewhere, output in the Kerry economy will be drastically affected and unemployment and emigration will rise.In conclusion, I call on the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that every pressure must be put on Ryanair at this stage to fulfil its contractual obligation with the Government to complete its PSO arrangement, which ends next July.  If that does not happen it must select another airline, and I understand Aer Arann is now in a position to take on this task in the very near future.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	766	Deputy Deenihan has outlined the facts in regard to Kerry Airport eloquently and there is no need for me to reiterate them.  However, this much must be added.  There are salutary lessons to be learned from the behaviour and performance of Ryanair at Kerry Airport.  In 2008 Ryanair made a bid for the PSO contract at the airport in order to run flights three times a day from Dublin to Kerry and back again.  It did so by undercutting the price of Aer Arann, which was then operational and successful at the airport.  It removed Aer Arann from the route by an old method which is known as predatory pricing.  It resulted in Aer Arann getting out of the marketplace in so far as the Dublin-Kerry route was concerned and being replaced by Ryanair.  Ryanair replaced Aer Arann with three enormous aeroplanes on the route comprising 189 passengers per plane.  I doubt if it filled the aeroplane on any day.  In any event, we are into the third year and Ryanair is to pull the plug on Kerry Airport and says it will not fly the route three times a day any more, but only once a day.It is very clear what has happened.  Aer Arann went into examinership.  Ryanair saw that the coast was clear and decided that it would then leave Kerry Airport for the most part and retain one flight per day, and do so on a commercial basis without the aid of the PSO.    Interestingly, in its statement to the press Ryanair said that it did not believe the public service obligation should exist any longer.  So much for Ryanair's commitment to regionalisation.  It was, I suppose, a purely commercial decision but the predatory nature of it is something of which all governments should take heed.Monopolies in dominant positions in the marketplace are always undesirable.  They are always dangerous, and they always end up with a sad tale.  This is a particularly sad tale, as Deputy Deenihan has outlined, because of the serious adverse consequences it has on tourism and commerce for the people of County Kerry.  Ryanair did not simply walk out of County Kerry.  It did leave a commercial route, as it stated, to Dublin each day and operates international flights from the airport.  In the interest of balance I will say that much of the work done by Mr. O'Leary and Ryanair in this country has been fairly laudable.  However, I find some of their practices to be despicable and in this particular instance it cannot be described as anything other than despicable.The company was obliged to give the Government three months' notice of its intention to leave Kerry County Airport.  It decided to give no notice whatsoever.  It waited until the contract was beginning to run out — next July — and when it saw that it could possibly get away with it without perhaps being sued, it simply upped and left.  That is not good enough and it is not acceptable.As an island nation we must think very deeply about the way we are going to deal with aviation and the kind of policies we will keep and implement for the future because if we are going to allow monopolies in dominant positions in the marketplace decide the future of our people, in so far as aviation is concerned, the future of our people, particularly in the regions of this country, and more particularly in the peripheral regions, is fairly bleak.

This service is operated under the current public service obligation, PSO, contracts for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West in Knock, Galway and Kerry.These contracts commenced on 22 July 2008 and are due to expire on 21 July 2011.  Exchequer subvention is paid in respect of these services on the basis that they would not be provided by the airlines on a fully commercial basis.In the case of the Kerry route, following an EU public tendering process, a bid submitted by Ryanair emerged as the winner.  The bid met the requirement in terms of proposed operating timetables as set out in the specifications published in the EU Official Journal, which stipulated that three return flights per day would be provided.  The bid from Ryanair also set out the compensation it required to operate the service.  Based on that bid, Ryanair was awarded the contract to provide the scheduled air services over the three year contract period and are receiving payments in accordance with the contract.The Minister for Transport refutes recent claims by Ryanair in regard to the PSO contract and states that he has met his obligations under the terms of that contract.  The Minister is currently considering the company's notification to reduce frequencies on the route from three daily return services to one daily return service with effect from 1 November 2010 on a commercial basis outside the PSO arrangement.  A response will issue to Ryanair once all options have been examined, having regard to the terms of the contract, the obligations on Ryanair to provide a service under that contract and EU legislation.  I will convey the views of the Deputies who spoke on this important issue to the Minister.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	768	A boundary extension into County Clare is unnecessary, inappropriate and seeks to resolve a problem that does not exist.  Such action will divide people of a common heritage, alienate them from their roots and undermine the foundation of their identity.  Those citizens of County Clare whose identity is immersed in the history, heritage and community of County Clare would be dealt an unwarranted and unwelcome injustice if a boundary extension was granted for no obvious gain or mitigating benefit.  In essence, these people would be robbed of their identity to resolve a bureaucratic impasse that has arisen in the minds of some.  The governance of an area, region, county or parish should exist to serve the people and not to serve the bureaucracy.I reject without reservation the proposal to extend the city of Limerick into County Clare.  I reject the assertion that those people who live in that area have not got a real connection with County Clare and can, at the stroke of a pen, find themselves reclassified as Limerick people.  The bedrock of our society is based on parish and county boundaries, and one's identity is intrinsically linked to this structure.I reject the notion that this move will somehow improve the prospects of attracting foreign investment to the region and, consequently, improve the job prospects of those who so tragically occupy the jobseekers' queue.  The report has not outlined in any material way how one job will be created or the life of one resident improved by this hostile act.A smoke screen has been created by some in the region who have had a land grab on their minds for many decades.  I appeal to those in control of Limerick City Council, namely, the Labour and Fine Gael members, to withdraw their stated desire to extend the boundary of Limerick city into County Clare.  Since this issue is being debated in the House I ask the leadership of Fine Gael and Labour to bring to bear on the councillors in Limerick city the views and wishes of the people of the county I represent.  They must make a clear signal of their views on this matter.I reject the public utterances of the chairman of the boundary committee in which he implies that this is just the beginning of the process and that if Clare County Council does not do as he says, more land will be taken.  That sounds like an individual who is used to getting his own way.  The last time I checked, this is still a democracy and that individual was not elected to any public office.  His role is in an advisory capacity and only an advisory capacity.While the Minister must take the advice that emanates from people like that I ask that he would listen also to the advice and views coming from this House.  In my short time in the Dáil I have demonstrated a capacity to support tough and unpopular decisions where I have adjudged them to be in the best interest of the country, county or region.  If I thought for one minute that the movement of the boundary was the right thing to do, I would support it, but it is not, and I will not support any moves to alter the boundary between Limerick and Clare.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	769	This is a very serious issue in County Clare and the fact that it has cross-party support from Deputy Dooley and myself and from the other Oireachtas Members also is an indication of the strength of support it has in the county.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me with this debate.  The Limerick local government authority, which was established by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to prepare a report into the most appropriate arrangements for local government for Limerick city and county, has recommended the setting up of a single authority to manage Limerick city and county.  That is fine but, unfortunately, the report also proposes that this expanded authority would include parts of County Clare which runs from Larkins Cross into Limerick city, taking in the housing estates of Shannon Banks and Westbury.Approximately 3,000 people currently live in that area south of east Clare.  The committee under Mr. Brosnan concluded that change is necessary and is motivated solely by the need to create coherent areas which will facilitate more effective governance structures.  I suggest that extending the remit of a new Limerick authority into sections of County Clare is misplaced and misguided.This report is a Limerick solution to a Limerick problem.  It is not a regional solution to a regional problem, which is what is required in this case.  If we are to break the cycle of unemployment and fuel an economic recovery in our region, all of our energies must be focused on working together.I want to make it clear on behalf of the people of County Clare, and I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not present, that we do not want a boundary change.  The spirit of people in County Clare is best displayed in all aspects of the sporting and cultural life in our county.  The Minister of State need only cast his mind back to Croke Park and 1995, when Clare hurlers bridged an 81 year gap to win the All-Ireland Hurling Final, to understand the importance and pride in County Clare and in the County Clare jersey.The people of County Clare have a deep sense of identifying and belonging to their county and that is no more evident than in the parishes of Meelick, Parteen, Ardnacrusha and Clonlara.If the Minister starts to tamper with the Clare boundary where will it stop?  Will Limerick demand to extend as far as Shannon Airport in a few years time?I appeal to the Minister of State to give serious consideration to alternative proposals which would deliver greater co-operation between the local authorities in both counties, while at the same time respecting the wishes of the people of County Clare.  The divide and conquer strategy has always failed so I appeal to the Minister of State to bin the proposal to extend the Limerick boundary into Clare.  The development of our region will be best served by respectful understanding of our differences.  Working together in a spirit of co-operation is the only way forward to restore the fortunes of the region.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	770	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government asked me to convey his apologies on not being able to attend the Dáil tonight to the two Deputies who raised this very important matter from their point of view.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government established the Limerick local government committee in February of this year under Part V of the Local Government Act 1991 to prepare a report into the most appropriate arrangements for local government for the city and county of Limerick.  The committee was specifically tasked with making recommendations for improved arrangements, to help inform Government decision making.  Mr. Denis Brosnan chaired the committee.  Mr. Brosnan is also chair of the mid-west task force, and his personal achievements in the business world lend additional weight to the independent perspective of the committee.In noting the decline in particular of Limerick's urban core, the high levels of unemployment and the significant deprivation, the committee concluded that the multiplicity of authorities in the area had led to unhelpful competition, policy fragmentation and a lack of coherence.  The report, published earlier this month, contains the committee's recommendations on the current structures of local government in Limerick.  These are directed at renewing local government with the objective of addressing the social and economic difficulties in Limerick.The committee's principal recommendations include the incorporation of the contiguous urban areas of Limerick within an expanded city area.  Such a city area would have a population of almost 100,000, including approximately five square kilometres of land with a population of approximately 3,000 which is currently part of Clare, and would, therefore, be the third largest city in the State.  It also recommends the establishment of a new unified Limerick local authority to represent, manage and administer the city and county of Limerick, replacing Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  The new authority would service a population of approximately 187,000 people.The committee considered that there is a compelling case for the proposed change with regard to the hinterland of Limerick city in southern Clare.  The committee pointed out that this change will not affect divisions used for purposes other than local government, for example, by sporting associations.  There is a very proud sporting tradition in Clare and we in Cork fully appreciate that.  All stakeholders should examine the report carefully and consider the recommendations it contains with a view to determining the benefits for the mid-west region as a whole.  A strong city is a crucial component of a strong region.It is significant that the business community in Limerick has called for the implementation of the report's recommendations as soon as possible.  The Limerick Chamber of Commerce is unequivocal in its support.  Shannon Development has also welcomed the report and has given all of the recommendations its strong support, stating that, "the long-term economic development prospects of the Shannon Region are best served by having Limerick City as a strong, vibrant metropolitan core fulfilling its potential as the economic driving force of the Region".  Greater local government coherence in Limerick is necessary for many reasons, including to help support regional development, improve the business environment and to play its role in the major regeneration efforts currently under way.The strength of county identities and the attachment people have to their counties is acknowledged.  The Minister notes that the committee took the position that the need to create coherent areas to facilitate more effective governance structures should not be overridden by such attachments, however strong.It is important that we act on Limerick, and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will soon bring proposals to Government for discussion with a view to early implementation of the Government's decisions.  In the meantime, pending Government consideration, comment by the Minister in any further detail on the report's recommendations would be inappropriate, other than to observe that the detailed analysis presented in the committee's report presents an extremely strong argument for action on the current structures of local government in Limerick.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for the opportunity to raise this matter and I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, who will reply to the debate but I am disappointed, given the fact that I met him in the public corridors five minutes ago, that the Minister with responsibility for this matter, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has not turned up in the Chamber.Today, this month's live register figures were published and almost 450,000 people are unemployed.  I will not dwell on the Government's lack of a jobs policy.  I am here to try to assist in problem solving because for thousands of people getting their statutory entitlement to a redundancy payment is proving to be an extraordinary endurance course.  I raised this matter some weeks ago with the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who seemed to take some comfort in the fact that the waiting list for redundancy payments had been cut from 43,000 last November to 33,000 in August this year.  On that basis of progress, we will be waiting several years before the list will be cleared, given the fact that thousands more come onto the list every month.To me, the State should aspire to pay statutory entitlement to people going through a very traumatic time in the shortest period possible, and an eight-week period should be the target for the Government to set itself.  That is not an excessively burdensome target.  The basis for achieving this is in the Croke Park agreement, which states:In view of the major economic challenges facing the country the Government are committed to obtaining maximum efficiencies from, and reducing the size of, the Public Service.  The Government and the public service unions confirm that in the context of a reduction in numbers serving in the public service:(i) it will from time to time be necessary to increase staffing in certain designated priority areas in accordance with Government policyIt also states that the Minister reserves the right to redeploy civil servants as may be required and appropriate between Departments to meet priority needs.The question that the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, has to answer, and that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, might attempt to answer, is what priority is attached by the Government to paying people their statutory redundancy when they lose their jobs.  I understand it is a cumbersome process if a former employer does not co-operate and a recommendation is required from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  However, in the majority of cases it should be straightforward.  I am sure the Minister of State accepts that seven or eight months is an unacceptable delay.The genesis of the solution to the problem is the Croke Park agreement and I wish the Minister would get on with it.  Perhaps he is unable to exert sufficient influence around the Cabinet table — I am loathe to indicate he might be the weakest link in Cabinet — to get the necessary resources.The subject matter of many parliamentary questions today is when the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will pay individuals named in those questions their entitlement to statutory redundancy.  The Minister of State can head off this issue by obtaining sufficient resources.  People ring up and are referred to the National Employment Rights Authority; the Department will not even answer the phone.  I could understand that if we were making progress in payments but there is a seven or eight month waiting list for people for their statutory entitlement and that is simply not acceptable.  I urge the Minister of State to problem solve and obtain more staff resources.  In many areas in the public and Civil Service there is not the same demand now that there is a reduction of activity in our economy, and human resources need to be directed to where we have problems.  I implore the Minister of State to address the issue.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	772	I thank Deputy Creed for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  Without starting a political debate on the issue, the Croke Park agreement is a critical component in the overall restructuring of public services and the delivery of services to the public.  At the time, we were criticised quite a lot by some Members opposite for spending too much time engaged in discussions with the unions trying to reach an agreement.  That is an aside but it is important to point out that the Croke Park agreement is an integral part of reform of the public services.Unfortunately, the economic downturn has left employers with little choice other than to radically reorganise and rationalise their business models, unfortunately leading, in the worst case scenario, to making employees redundant.Fortunately, in the first eight months of this year, there is concrete evidence of a levelling off of redundancy levels.  In 2009, the monthly level of redundancy claims lodged with my Department averaged almost 6,500 a month and, to date this has reduced to an average of just under 5,500.The Department administers the Social Insurance Fund in redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection and makes two types of payment from the fund — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership or liquidation.The Department is currently processing redundancy claims including rebates and lump sums dating from February and March of this year so that the waiting time is approximately six or seven months.  In some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.The Department has made significant efforts to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for individual employees and for the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the payments area include: almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full-time equivalents; establishment of a special call-handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from individuals and businesses concerned about their payments; better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website; and engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I was there for a period as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs.  It is the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs who is statutorily functionally responsible for the redundancy section.  This was something that was becoming very evident, and we started to move resources and tried to put in place mechanisms that would facilitate and expedite payments.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	774	I accept that the backlog and waiting times remain at an unacceptably high level.  However, improvements are evident and the waiting times are reducing.  I should point out that my Department has, in the eight-month period up to the end of August 2010, processed 51,800 claims, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 when the level of claims processed was 26,405.  The number processed in that period also outstrips the total number of claims processed for the whole of 2009 when the level of claims processed was 50,664.Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding eight-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.  Indicative figures for September, with one further day to go, are promising and point to a significant levelling off of new claims.  If this trend continues, it will be very welcome.The claims backlog, which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009, has been reduced considerably to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.  I understand that when the September figures are finalised over the next day or so, the backlog will show a further significant reduction to about 30,000.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.The 52 full-time staff work exceptionally hard.  They work well and beyond the call of duty.  They are flexible and they are conscious that behind these statistics are employees and employers who have faced a difficult turbulence in their lives due to the difficult economic circumstances and those who have lost their jobs.

In addition 78 schools are connected under the joint initiative with the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources to provide post primary schools with 100Mbp/s and 7 schools are connected under the NCTE Hermes project which links participating primary schools to a central server and network which controls the ICT infrastructure in each school utilising  broadband connectivity and thin client architecture.Forty-six schools are due to be connected shortly and these are made up of new  schools, schools where building works may have delayed the install or schools  that have moved location and need to be installed in the new location.Seventy-one schools have declined a connection from the Department, while I do not have a break down of their reasons, I understand that schools may have made their own internet connection arrangements. There is no obligation on schools to  avail of a connection provided by the Department and schools are free to source  their broadband from the market should they so chose.  All of these schools are  also free to avail of a connection provided by the Department anytime in the  future.However I would encourage schools to avail of an internet service under the  Schools Broadband Programme, as under the Programme connectivity to the  internet is routed through a National Broadband Network, which has been  developed by HEAnet — the National Education and Research Network provider.  HEAnet has established a Network Operations Centre to channel and control the  broadband access to schools, and it provides centrally managed services for  schools such as security, anti-spam/anti-virus and content filtering.  Access to  resources such as on-line versions of Britannica and World Book are also only  available through the Schools Broadband Network.A national helpdesk has been established to interface between the network, the  Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the schools, and to provide schools with  on-going advice and assistance.  This helpdesk is managed by the NCTE.  Schools who use a service provider not contracted to the Department do not have access to these services, protections and support.  Those schools not on the network are still free to contact the service desk for general advice.The roll out of the new broadband contracts is nearing completion and as a  result the number of schools on satellite is being reduced by over 50%.The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the name and  roll number for each school in the programme will be forwarded shortly.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	776	Following an internal audit report, which found irregularities in the delivery of its contracted training FÁS has been reviewing the training that it  contracts for the unemployed.  A number of issues of concern have arisen and  FÁS is dealing with them in order to ensure that learners get the training and  certification that they deserve while minimising the costs to the agency.FÁS has identified a total of 54 training courses, all delivered in its  North-East region, involving 968 course participants and 1719 certificates  where certain issues remain outstanding before final certification can  proceed.  FÁS is working with the contractors concerned to resolve these  matters and I understand from FÁS that these certificates will be issued  shortly.  No costs to date have been incurred to FÁS as a result of these  certification matters and FÁS does not anticipate bearing any further costs.The new Board of FÁS, together with the Director General, who also serves on  the Board as an ex-officio member, are putting in place new procedures and  practices to ensure that instances like this should not recur.  These include:A new system to upgrade training standards is being rolled out with an  emphasis on more robust and frequent monitoring of FÁS training and assessment systems.New contracted training procedures and revised contracts including more  robust sanctions for non-compliance have been developed and agreed which are  due to commence this month.A revised tender framework with the aim of raising the quality of the  training offered to FÁS clients is being introduced.A new assessment marking scheme will be introduced in the first half of 2011  which will align FÁS's marking and grading criteria with FETAC requirements.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	777	I am very aware of the challenges we face in dealing with the kinds of basic skills needs which were identified in the NALA survey referred to by the  Deputy.  The provision of numeracy to children and adults is already a key  feature of measures to address educational disadvantage and it also forms a key  element of second chance and further education and training programmes,  especially for those with low levels of skills.VECs delivery numeracy tuition as part of the adult literacy and community  education scheme.  Funding for adult literacy has increased from €1 million in  1997 to €30 million in 2010 and the number of participants increased from 5,000  to 50,000 in the same period. Overall, in 2009, over 130,000 participants took  part in a range of part-time further education programmes at Levels 1-4 on  the NFQ, where core skills like literacy, numeracy and ICT are a fundamental  part of the courses.  New awards in this area have also been developed at  Levels 1 and 2 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).Within the Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education (ITABE) programme,  numeracy is specifically referenced as part of the curriculum and assessment  system.  My Department funded NALA to produce a "curriculum guide" for ITABE  which includes a numeracy section and my Department also provides funds to the Literacy Development Centre in Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) to  develop courses for literacy practitioners, including a specific numeracy  module.At second level, my Department is implementing Project Maths, a major programme of reform designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics.  In 2010, the first cohort of students in Project Maths pilot schools sat the Leaving Certificate and the results were very encouraging and it is currently being rolled out to all schools.  Some €3m was provided for Project Maths in 2009 and of the order €4m is being invested in professional development of teachers in 2010.In the junior cycle itself, a more investigative approach is used to build on  and extend students' experience of mathematics.  In primary schools, a bridging  framework that links mathematics to topics in the Junior Certificate  mathematics syllabuses is being developed.  Promoting proficiency in numeracy  is also a core objective of a range of measures under the DEIS Action Plan.All of this shows that my Department is very engaged with addressing issues  around numeracy and I will continue to work to address these issues.

The report covers income and expenditure associated with the charge, internal allocation processes for same, arrangements for accounting for the charge additional charges that are levied on students outside the charge.Officials from my Department are following up with the HEA in relation to  aspects of the report and its findings in more detail.  It is envisaged the  outcome of the review will lead to the adoption of accounting policies that can  be applied in a consistent manner across the sectors and between institutions  and to an examination and updating of the HEA's Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services.Subject to its detailed consideration, it will be my intention to make the  report available more generally in due course.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	779	On 23 March, 2010, the Taoiseach announced to the Dáil a number of Ministerial and Departmental changes designed to ensure closer alignment of the Government's economic objectives to the administrative functions of its  departments and agencies.  As part of these changes the Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order of 2010, which came into force on 1 May 2010, reallocated responsibility for FÁS as an Agency and its funding related to training and skills from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation to the Department of Education and Skills.  Responsibility for the employment service and community service activities of FÁS and its related funding has also transferred to my Department. However, following the enactment of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 in late July, the Department of Social Protection will, following commencement of the relevant sections, assume overall responsibility for the policy and funding of FÁS employment programmes and employment services.I understand that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection intends to  bring forward more detailed legislative proposals at an early date to provide  for the full integration of the FÁS employment programmes and employment  services with his Department.The Board of FÁS is currently working on its strategy for the FÁS organisation  for the future and will present it to my Department shortly.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	780	I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 126 together.The process of paying third level or further education grants is a matter for  the relevant local authority or VEC.The timing of payment varies between the 66 awarding bodies depending on a  number of variables including the volume of applications received, staffing  resources and whether or not properly completed application forms have been  received.This year's student grant schemes include a number of significant  administrative and service improvements aimed at addressing the issue of delays  which include an initial roll-out of a new on-line grant application system. The  new system, introduced in both Irish and English, is already now operating in  11 grant awarding authorities.  Building on this initial phase for the current  academic year, the ultimate aim will be to make it available to all applicants  nationally.The on-line system is part of a package of administrative and service  improvements brought to the Student Grant Schemes this year. Key among the  other changes are a complete overhaul of the grant application form,  streamlined administrative processes, advance payments to awarding authorities  and, most importantly, the publication of the grant schemes some two months  earlier than last year.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	781	I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 131 together.The Government will consider all proposals relating to public expenditure in  the context of the forthcoming Budget. The Government has already made it clear in this regard that difficult decisions will be necessary across the broad  spectrum of expenditure in order to secure the significant level of savings  required.  The components of the Education budget are currently being examined  as part of this process.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	782	The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains information relating to class size in primary schools for the 2009-2010 school year. The information includes the number of pupils in each class and the number of pupils in each class size range.The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published  annually on my Department's website. In terms of the position at individual  school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by  my Department for the current school year is the pupil enrolment at 30  September 2009. While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an  average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its  classes.Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and  this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the  foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the difficult budgetary climate the  Government has tried, as best as possible, to protect the front line services  in the education sector through continuing to allow schools to recruit  additional teachers notwithstanding the general moratorium on public sector  recruitment. The Deputy will be aware that the renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government and also the provision of 500 additional teaching posts between primary and second  levels over a three year period.

Of this number, 2,363 were primary schools, 588 post-primary schools and 107 were special schools.Of 2,363 primary schools reviewed 1,261 schools had no change in their SNA  level, 704 had a decrease in SNA level, and 398 schools had an increase in  their SNA level.Of 588 primary schools reviewed 304 schools had no change in their SNA level,  158 had a decrease in SNA level, and 126 schools had an increase in their SNA  level.Of 107 special schools reviewed 57 schools had no change in their SNA level, 29 had a decrease in SNA level, and 21 schools had an increase in their SNA level.There are currently in excess of 10,000 SNAs in schools compared with just 300 in 1997.SNA posts may be reduced in schools, on review, where the pupils for whom SNA posts were originally allocated had left the school or because the pupils' care needs had diminished over time.However, I wish to emphasise that the criteria governing the allocation of SNA  posts has not changed, and that SNA posts continue to be retained, and new  posts sanctioned, where the care needs of pupils meet the criteria for the  scheme.The full updated report will be published by the NCSE shortly on its website  www.ncse.ie.A small number of schools remain to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed early in the 2010/11 academic year.I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the  SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful  integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream  education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and  special classes. The SNA scheme will continue to be supported and the NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and resources will continue to be allocated to schools to meet children's needs in line with my  Department's policy.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	784	For the 2009/2010 academic year the number of approved PLC places available nationwide was increased by 1,500 to 31,688 and this level of provision is being maintained for the current academic year (2010/2011).  In 2009/2010, VECs enrolled over 38,600 learners which is a commendable achievement and one which I hope can be maintained for the current academic year.The overall number of approved PLC places is set at its current level because  there is a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers and to manage  expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	785	My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The DEIS plan was launched in 2005 and currently includes some 879 Schools serving the most disadvantaged communities in the Country.The School Completion Programme (SCP) is an important component of my  Department's strategy to target children and young people who are at risk of  early school leaving.  The programme currently targets approximately 36,000  young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years and supports 468 primary and  223 post-primary schools in 124 Programme sites across 26 counties.  The  programme is designed to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the  education system and favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral  approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum  participation levels in the education process.The main aims of the School Completion Programme are:To retain young people in the formal education system, or equivalent, to  successful completion of the Senior Cycle;To improve the quality of participation and educational attainment of  targeted children and young people in the educational process;To bring together all local stakeholders (home, school, youth and community/statutory and voluntary) to tackle early school leaving;To offer positive supports in primary and post-primary schools towards the  alleviation of educational disadvantage;To influence in a positive way policies relating to the alleviation of early  school leaving in the school system.€31 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme in 2010.   Funding is provided to projects to devise and implement strategies for the  whole-school, for individual students and those who are already outside of the  formal system.  Provision includes in-school, after-school, out-of-school and  holiday time supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from  education.Since September, 2009, the remit of the National Educational Welfare Board  (NEWB) has been extended to bring together the School Completion Programme  (SCP), the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL), the National  Educational Welfare Service (EWS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for  Travellers (VTST) under one common management team.  The underlying rationale for this new single strategic approach, acknowledging and utilising the  combined strengths and capacities of the four services, is to deliver better  outcomes for children, families and schools.  Combining these four services to  deliver a composite service at national, regional and local levels is a  positive development and one that will in time realise significant benefits.My Department has asked the NEWB to bring forward recommendations for a "single strategic approach" to delivery of all services to establish improvements in  identifying children at risk of early school leaving or of developing poor  attendance profiles.  This will lead to earlier response rates.  The new  approach should also provide improvements in developing local and national  responses to tackling attendance and early school leaving.My Department makes alternative provision for young people in the 15-20 age  group who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational  training. The Youthreach programme, which is operated by the VECs, is an  integrated programme of education, training and work experience introduced  jointly with FÁS in 1989.While the problem of early school leaving continues to be a major concern,  improvements in the numbers of students leaving school early have been recorded in recent years.  The latest Retention Report published by my Department last November shows yearly improvements in retention rates — rising from an estimated 81% to 85% for entrants to second level in 1996 and 2001  respectively.  Retention rates of pupils in Second-Level School Cohort can be  found on my Department's website — www.education.ieI will continue to prioritise spending in favour of those from marginalised and  disadvantaged communities and I will sustain the commitment to improve the  delivery of services to schools and communities to enable them to enhance the  educational experience for all of their pupils.

In this context, the  review also looked at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and  catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money  in the Scheme.The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is  currently being finalised.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 343 together.The Deputy will be aware that the 2007 Programme for Government committed to the long-term funding for the centres in the ABA pilot scheme subject to  agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.Agreement on transitional arrangements for the pilot centres was reached  following a long process of discussions and engagement with the representative  body of the pilot centres.  Each of the centres has now applied for special  school status.  I am pleased to advise you that I have been able to respond  positively to applications and all, but one, of the centres have now been  granted recognition as special schools for children with autism. The  application from the remaining centre is currently being processed.I fully appreciate that change in any organisation can cause concern and  anxiety.  This is particularly true when the organisation is a centre catering  for children with special educational needs.  However, I understand that each  of the centres engaged with parents and staff before applying for special  school status.Managers have been appointed by the schools to manage the transitional  process.  As part of this process, my Department is arranging for training in a  range of autism-specific interventions for the new Principals and Teachers once  they have been appointed.  In addition, training is being provided for the  Managers and the new Boards of Management.  It is my intention to continue to  support the transitional process.My Department's Inspectorate carried out an evaluation of educational provision  for children with autistic spectrum disorders some years ago.  A copy of this  report is available on my Department's website www.education.gov.ie. Part of  this review evaluated the centres funded under my Department's ABA Pilot  Scheme.

At the conclusion of this meeting, we agreed  to continue our discussions on funding issues pertaining to Protestant  fee-charging schools.I am committed to continuing this engagement with members of the Protestant  community, as I believe that these issues are best resolved collaboratively.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	789	It is the policy of my Department that only qualified personnel should be  employed by schools. Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in  exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting  qualified personnel have been exhausted and only for quite limited time periods.This is now reflected in Circular 40/2010 which my Department issued earlier  this year.  Under its terms, schools are directed to ensure that teachers  proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the  Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable  to the post for which they are proposed.  Where an employer can satisfactorily  demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an  appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified and/or  unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an  appropriately qualified and registered teacher and this provision must be  inserted in the employment contract.  The employer must repeat the process to  recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of  any such contract and in any event within the school year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	790	I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 199 together.My Department is in receipt of a major capital application for an extension  from the school to which the Deputy refers. The application has been assessed  in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale  building projects and assigned a Band 2.2 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is  available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published  prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the  Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of  which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching  to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my  Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project,  from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.The Department has received the proposal from the school and officials in my  Department will contact the school shortly in this regard.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	791	The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published  annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level  of staffing resources provided at individual school level for the current  school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009.Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and  this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the  foreseeable future. The Deputy will be aware that the renewed Programme for  Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher  ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  The renewed Programme for Government also provides for 500 teaching posts to  schools over the next three years over and above additional posts that will  arise due to demographic increases.  The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools who are dissatisfied with their staffing allocation. The appeals criteria are outlined in the published staffing schedule which is available on my Department's website.The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until  the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for  mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards  will have been considered. The appellate process is particularly relevant at  post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned  are considered.Extensive statistical information is available on my Department's website in  relation to class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios. It is early to speculate at  this stage on the pupil-teacher ratio trend for the 2010-2011 school year.  However I would not expect it to be significantly different from recent years  because, notwithstanding the general moratorium on public sector recruitment,  the Government has agreed to allow schools to increase their teacher numbers to cater for demographic growth.It is also important to note that from an educational perspective numerous  influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the  single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving  educational outcomes for children.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	792	I have not met the Children's Mental Health Coalition, but my colleague Mr. Barry Andrews T.D Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and officials of my  Department have done so. I am aware of the manifesto of the Children's Mental  Health Coalition, which recommends the provision of guidelines to schools on  mental health, the expansion of the Social Personal and Health Education  support team, and the delivery of SPHE in every school year.The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle since 2003 and is  designed to promote positive mental health. It is already supported by  comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services which provide  training and advice for schools and a resource directory. Its aim is to foster  personal development, health and well being of children, to help them create  and maintain supportive relationships, and develop the skills and attitudes for  responsible citizenship. SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of  a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care  structures in schools.The implementation of the SPHE curriculum has been supported by national  programmes of professional development for teachers at primary and post primary level provided by the curriculum support services. These services continue to be maintained, but my Department is not in a position to expand them at the present time.Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a  module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate  Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.All post-primary schools also provide a guidance and counselling service for  their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this  provision. The service includes the provision of individual guidance and  counselling for students either at critical stages in their education or at  times of personal crisis.The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) operating within my  Department provides a range of services both direct and indirect which support  the personal, social and educational development of all children in primary and  post-primary schools. NEPS also liaises with HSE services as appropriate in its  service to schools.My Department's commitment to the NEPS service has been recently reiterated  within the Renewed Programme for Government which commits to an overall  expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210. Through these initiatives, our  school system works hard to promote positive mental health among students.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I set out below for the Deputies information:Table (A) outlining the number of rented prefabs in place in 2010, and those  that were in place in 2009 in primary and  post primary schools and the annual  rental costs involved on a county by county basis. The information for 2008 is  not readily available.Table (B) outlining prefabricated structures purchased for schools since 2008  and the costs involved on a county by county basis. My Department does not  currently hold information on purchased prefabs  in situ in schools pre 2008.   A  new inventory of accommodation, both temporary and permanent, has gone live on the Esinet portal and data collection has commenced.  The data obtained will  supplement the information held on the Department’s existing databases,  particularly with regard to purchased prefabricated accommodation that was in  place prior to January 2008 and create a more complete picture of the use of  prefabricated accommodation in schools.Table (C) outlining the number of rented prefabs sanctioned for each of the  past 3 years.  Please note that numbers of prefabs listed refer to  prefabricated "units" and may consist of one or more classrooms.The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the highest standard of  permanent accommodation for all schools.  However, in the context of a rapidly  increasing school population and competing pressure on the capital budget  available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary  accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.  This  temporary accommodation is suitable for use as classroom accommodation.  It is  important, when additional teacher posts are sanctioned by my Department, that  schools are facilitated to appoint and accommodate them as soon as possible.With regard to consideration being given to the provision of permanent  structures to replace such buildings, a change in policy implemented by my  Department is to provide devolved grant aid for the purchase (rather than  rental) of additional  accommodation where the need for such accommodation is  likely to exist for more than 3 years. Furthermore, since July 2008, it is also  policy to offer schools being approved for devolved grant aid for additional  accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent  classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab. These policies will reduce the  usage of prefabricated accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of  long-term rental of prefabs.My Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and  systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving  best value for money. The review is well under way and incorporates the  development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the  development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation  options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect  the interests of the Department and school authorities.Rented Prefabs  by County as at September 2010CountyPrimaryPost-PrimaryAnnual Rental2010Prefab No’sPrefab No’sB + C For 2010€Carlow136292,482.30Cavan272395,589.68Clare640710,364.52Cork22793,146,740.91Dublin268215,592,530.83Donegal525783,984.87Galway132141,731,927.10Kerry320348,877.44Kilkenny210210,945.91Kildare11601,568,533.20Laois350537,244.81Leitrim100141,360.24Limerick610625,137.56Longford120186,025.04Louth8381,370,775.72Mayo524527,575.39Meath12411,993,870.82Monaghan134210,341.66Offaly166322,255.58Roscommon140123,580.55Sligo250260,713.05Tipperary400488,216.67Waterford5012712,073.42Westmeath300387,420.58Wexford741773,498.57Wicklow588756,996.14Total No. of Prefab Units1,64910124,199,062.56CountyPrimaryPost-PrimaryAnnual Rental2009Prefab No’sPrefab No’sB + C For 2009€Carlow186340,870.90Cavan292429,064.32Clare700799,620.39Cork22493,136,775.72Dublin300195,092,708.37Donegal7151,098,023.05Galway139141,845,426.22Kerry330394,186.77Kilkenny220243,892.63Kildare13581,903,481.59Laois380581,795.54Leitrim100167,000.48Limerick630660,114.50Longford130199,343.04Louth7711,180,085.31Mayo604582,006.68Meath13412,105,972.20Monaghan144223,340.76Offaly223414,060.88Roscommon142153,216.46Sligo260295,063.23Tipperary430524,773.61Waterford5112790,620.14Westmeath310436,683.09Wexford821890,695.26Wicklow618758,427.54Total No. of Prefab Units1,7809925,247,248.68CountyPrimaryPost-PrimaryCombined Cost2008No. of PrefabsNo. of PrefabsFor B + C€Carlow30360,000.00Cavan60692,725.00Clare1501,316,912.00Cork24113,102,914.00Donegal481,430,480.00Dublin4334,367,633.00Galway1252,268,768.00Kerry41591,673.00Kildare952,484,723.00Kilkenny50520,000.00Laois80589,557.00Leitrim000.00Limerick53746,270.00Longford30360,000.00Louth1111,509,594.00Mayo31420,000.00Meath3034,227,265.00Monaghan12270,000.00Offaly62696,828.00Roscommon20250,944.00Sligo34598,573.00Tipperary43636,625.00Waterford491,086,599.00Westmeath871,367,466.00Wexford60612,667.00Wicklow30306,800.00Total No. of Prefab Units2226830,815,016.00CountyPrimaryPost-PrimaryCombined Cost2009No. of PrefabsNo. of PrefabsFor B + C€Carlow1050,000.00Cavan2073,060.00Clare20199,361.00Cork1181,416,399.00Donegal64629,372.00Dublin17162,492,570.00Galway871,090,984.00Kerry03119,437.00Kildare30243,822.00Kilkenny28851,793.00Laois140774,581.00Leitrim0141,701.00Limerick41265,734.00Longford30190,750.00Louth20198,745.00Mayo20119,000.00Meath72670,000.00Monaghan44440,666.00Offaly30300,000.00Roscommon000.00Sligo15140,261.00Tipperary20108,091.00Waterford40346,987.00Westmeath21230,208.00Wexford06198,141.00Wicklow20109,874.00Total No. of Prefab Units1026611,301,537.00CountyPrimaryPost-PrimaryCombined Cost2010–To Sept 2010No. of PrefabsNo. of PrefabsFor B + C€Carlow1052,665.00Cavan10130,000.00Clare000.00Cork76949,704.00Donegal12107,211.00Dublin1661,714,479.00Galway60682,452.00Kerry50324,732.00Kildare000.00Kilkenny000.00Laois1038,952.00Leitrim12127,382.00Limerick40364,109.00Longford70371,382.00Louth32440,000.00Mayo04280,000.00Meath64624,207.00Monaghan40206,557.00Offaly000.00Roscommon000.00Sligo01111,336.00Tipperary000.00Waterford000.00Westmeath000.00Wexford20150,000.00Wicklow000.00Total No. of Prefab Units65276,675,168.00Primary And Post-Primary SchoolsYearNumber of PrefabAnnual RentalRentals SanctionedCost For Prefabs Sanctioned€201023347,566.69200949632,462.9220082465,388,618.33

The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their  technical and personal skills.Within current budgetary constraints, the number of places on CE have been  increased to 23,300 in 2010. In delivering these places, FÁS will continue to  operate flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise  progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the  support of community services.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The ICT in Schools Programme commenced in 1998 and since then €243m has been invested in the Programme. The Programme has addressed four broad areas.Firstly, the provision of essential ICT infrastructure and networking within  schools. Secondly, the provision of access to broadband connectivity to  schools.  Thirdly, up-skilling teachers' ICT skills and finally, integrating  ICT within the curriculum and providing curriculum relevant digital content and  software.In November 2009, the "Smart Schools = Smart Economy" Report was published.   This report builds on the 2008 strategy group report, and contains relevant  recommendations in the context of how best to realise the potential of ICT use  in schools. A Steering Group was established to oversee and advise on the  implementation of the recommendations. Following the publication of the Smart  Schools Report, €22m in ICT grants was provided to primary schools.  A similar  amount will issue shortly to post primary schools.  In addition to the  provision of ICT hardware there are significant developments on all aspects of  the ICT in Schools Programme. The National Centre for Technology in Education  contributes to the ICT in Schools Programme in several key respects. Under its  Teaching Skills Initiative, the NCTE offers a range of ICT related training  programmes. An estimated 12,000 training places were provided in 2009.   Scoilnet, the national portal for digital content in Irish Education provides a  central resource to teachers, pupils and parents, offering access to a growing  repository of advice and information.In relation to Broadband for schools, since the commencement of the rollout of  phase II in 2009 there has already been over a 50% increase in aggregate  bandwidth usage, this is due to improved bandwidth speeds being made available to schools and the substantial reduction in the number of schools who are connected via satellite.My Department is working with the Department of Communications, Energy and  Natural Resources in a pilot project to roll out 100 megabits broadband  connectivity to 78 post primary schools.  All 78 schools are now connected.  The  availability of 100 megabits will enable students to learn and collaborate  on-line and will provide potential for new forms of collaboration between  schools.My Department will continue to implement the ambitious ICT in Schools Programme which will ensure that our schools are making the best use of ICT in teaching and learning.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	796	The Report of the Innovation Task Force recommended that bonus points for  Higher Level Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate should be announced now,  for implementation from 2012 onwards, so that students beginning their Leaving  certificate can make informed decisions about subject and level choice.  I   indicated my own view at the time of the desirability of sending a clear signal  to our second level students about the introduction of CAO bonus points for  achievement in Leaving Certificate mathematics at higher level.Legally, the criteria for admission to higher education institutions are  matters for decision by the institutions themselves. The Academic Councils of  these institutions determine the admission arrangements for students.I wrote to the President of the Irish Universities Association, the Chairman of  Institutes of Technology Ireland and the President of the Dublin Institute of  Technology asking them to give early and favourable consideration to the  matter in the context of a suitably devised bonus points system which will  successfully encourage more students to study higher level maths.The Council of Registrars of IOTs has since indicated it is in favour of bonus  points for Maths provided they are implemented across the system. Many, but not all of the universities, have also indicated their support for this. The Irish  Universities Association is working to promote a co-ordinated approach to the  issue across the sector, and will keep me informed of developments.In the meantime, I have indicated in my Press Statement of 18 August that   students who are entering senior cycle in September should be aware of the  possibility of additional benefits of taking mathematics at higher level in  terms of CAO applications from 2012 onwards and should take this possibility  into account in making their Leaving Certificate subject choices.

The group normally used for these comparisons is adults aged 25-64 years inclusive.  Those aged under 25 years are not included as large numbers of people aged under 25 will not have completed their full-time education and thus cannot be meaningfully compared.The EU Commission (Eurostat) collate data from the different EU surveys and regularly publish estimates.Table 1 below presents the percentage of those aged 25-64 whose highest level of education attained is a third level qualification (ISCED 5-6).  Table 2 presents the percentage of those aged 25-64 whose highest level of education attained is lower secondary level or lower (ISCED 0-2) which is the lowest level of education for which comparable EU data has been published.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 to 141, inclusive, 143, 150, 166 and 167, inclusive, together.In June 2010 the Government sought nominations to the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) from the social partners in line with long-established practice.Ireland has nine places on the EESC and our nominations are divided equally between the three constituent Groups of the EESC: Employers; Employees; and Various Interests.  The nominations were forwarded by the Government to the Secretariat of the European Council.The Various Interests Group on the EESC comprises representatives of a wide variety of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, farmers' organisations, co-operatives and non-profit associations, and environmental organisations.  The EESC is mandated to consider environmental issues and environmental sustainability is a key focus of European policy.  Other countries have long had environmental organisation representatives among their nominees.For the first time, Ireland's nominees to the Various Interests Group of the EESC included a representative from the Environmental Pillar.  This change reflects the decision which was taken by Government last year to create a fifth Pillar of Social Partnership to represent Environmental concerns and was not in response to representations received.The Environmental Pillar of Social Partnership consists of twenty seven organisations with a diverse range of interests.  The Environmental Pillar selected an employee of BirdWatch Ireland as its nominee on the Committee.  She is therefore a representative of the twenty seven organisations in the Environmental Pillar and environmental interests more generally.  The Environmental Pillar representative will be able to draw on the combined capacity for economic, social and environmental research and analysis of the constituent members of the Pillar and its secretariat.  Information on the membership of BirdWatch Ireland and its objectives may be obtained directly from that organisation.Given that there is an overall limit of nine Irish places, it was necessary to reduce the nominations from the Farming Pillar from two to one.  This change to the composition of the Irish representation on the EESC does not reflect any diminution of the Government's commitment to the agricultural industry. The farming sector is an extremely important part of the Irish economy and the Government continues to strongly support its development at national and EU level.  The Food Harvest 2020 Strategy sets out a roadmap for the agricultural industry and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is chairing a high level group to oversee its implementation.It is also important to note that the Farming Pillar of social partnership and farming interests continue to be represented on the EESC through a representative of the Irish Farmers' Association.

The table below shows the number of persons employed in quarter 2 of each year from 2005 to 2010 and the overall change over the period classified by NACE sector as published by the CSO.Tourism related employment would be spread across sectors (primarily Accommodation and food service activities and Arts, entertainment, recreation and other service activities) while energy employment (Industry), communications employment (Information and communication) and sports employment (Arts, entertainment, recreation and other service activities) would in the main be sub-sectors of sectors for which estimates are currently published.It must also be noted that the table shows the overall number of persons employed at the given points in time. Changes in this stock level cannot be directly interpreted as being a number of jobs created as it is the net change occurring which will be impacted by both new jobs created and jobs lost in the sector in question.

Unemployed graduates  who are not receiving a social welfare payment will also be eligible to apply.Graduates must have attained a full award at level 7 or above on the National  Framework of Qualifications.Stream 2 (non-graduates)This stream will be open to all individuals who do not possess a full award at  level 7 or above on the National Framework of Qualifications.Unemployed individuals who are not receiving a social welfare payment are  eligible to apply.250 places will be ring-fenced for under 34s.Other Participant Criteria applying to participants irrespective of Stream  Individuals in receipt of a Jobseekers Benefit (JB) payment will now be  eligible to apply and participate on the Work Placement Programme (WPP).  Where  a person exhausts their entitlement to JB while participating on a WPP they can  apply for a Jobseekers Allowance (JA) payment, which is subject to satisfying a  means test. It should be noted that a participant who is not eligible for a  Jobseekers Allowance and has exhausted their entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit  would then not receive a social welfare payment.Individuals in receipt of other Social welfare allowances/payments will be  eligible to participate in the Programme, in accordance with existing  arrangements.

This may involve a doctor certifying that the work  placement will be rehabilitative.Individuals in these categories will be directed by FÁS to the Department of  Social Protection in the first instance and then once approval has been granted  they will be eligible to participate in the programme.The period for which participants have to be in receipt of a Social welfare  payment in order to be eligible has been reduced to 3 months. Periods spent on  FÁS training programmes for individuals who were in receipt of Social Welfare  payments prior to the commencement of the training will count in relation to  the Work Placement Programme's qualifying period.The placement will be for a maximum nine-month period.Local FÁS offices will be the first point of contact for those interested in  the Programme.FÁS will refer potential participants to providers. On referral from FÁS, the  provider of the work experience may interview potential participants.The Department of Social Protection will continue to pay social welfare  entitlements to participants on the Programme for the duration that their  entitlement exists.Criteria for Providers of Placements:The Work Placement Programme will be open to all sectors of the economy  including:The private sector,The public sector,The community and voluntary sector.Firms that have had redundancies in the last three months are not eligible to  participate.

However, in order to qualify providers must  employ at least one employee. The number of places a provider can avail of is  dependent on the number of employees they have.Number of Employees Number of WPP Placements1-10 employees: 1 Place.11-20 employees: 2 Places.21-30 employees: 3 Places.30 + employees: 10% of their workforce to a maximum of 25 places whichever is the smaller.The placement will be for a maximum nine-month period.Prospective providers shall register with FÁS.On referral from FÁS, the provider of the work experience may interview  potential participants.The placement will not be provided to fill an existing vacancy.The placement will not be provided to displace an existing employee.Providers must have Public and Employers' liability insurance and this must  cover the participant on the work placement.Providers must confirm that their company is fully compliant with current  workplace health and safety and all other legal requirements.The following table provides a breakdown of the posts approved, and currently  being advertised under the Programme as at 23rd September 2010.FÁS RegionAreas/CountiesGraduate Posts (WPP1)Non-Graduate Posts (WPP2)Total PostsDublin CentralBaggot Court, D’Olier House, Parnell Street, Ballyfermot, Cabra9465159Dublin SouthRathfarnham, Crumlin, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Dun Laoghaire, Loughlinstown6781148Dublin NorthBaldoyle, Balbriggan, Swords, Blanchardstown, Coolock, Finglas5168119MidlandsKildare, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath5267119Mid-WestClare, Limerick, Tipperary543286North-EastCavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan474693North-WestDonegal, Leitrim, Sligo113445South-EastCarlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow5580135South-WestCork, Kerry8174155WestGalway, Mayo, Roscommon314172Total5435881,131
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	819	Following a review of how FÁS might better support those in receipt of One  Parent Family payments, barriers to employment were identified in a number of  areas.  In addition, a FÁS internal cross-divisional review group in 2008  determined that persons in receipt of a One Parent Family Payment should be  able to access FÁS services in a seamless way so that they can avail of access,  transfer and progression options through, and across programmes as their  training needs dictate.Towards this end a Social Inclusion Model has been developed and approved for  testing by the Board of FÁS following consultations with relevant stakeholders  including the Department of Social Protection and the Irish Vocational  Education Association.   The Social Inclusion Model was tested in 2009 with  four groups of lone parents and a final evaluation is pending.In regard to child care in particular, it is anticipated that the new Child care  Employment and Training Support (CETS) Scheme recently introduced by the Office  of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will help to further remove a  significant barrier to the participation of lone parents in employment and  learning through the provision of almost 3,000 full-time equivalent child care  places for FÁS and VEC clients.The aim of the Community Employment Programme remains as an active labour  market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or  further education and training.  The programme is funded and managed within  this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs  of participants and the community.

The Programme is open to all  sectors of the economy, including the private and public sectors, as well as  the community and voluntary sectors.  The programme is voluntary and unpaid,  while participants on the programme may be able retain their existing social  welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement subject to the rules  of the Department of Social Protection.As of 16th September 1,860 people had commenced a placement under the Work  Placement Programme.  918 had taken up graduate placements and 942 commenced  non-graduate placements.The Work Placement Programme will continue to provide a vital opportunity for  the unemployed, including unemployed graduates to gain valuable work experience  that will keep them closer to the labour market and will assist them in  securing employment in the future.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	821	The Job Initiative (JI) programme was launched in July 1996 and continues to  provide full-time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, who  were unemployed for five years or more, and in receipt of social welfare  payments over that qualifying period before entering the programme.The main purpose of JI is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for  work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and  development opportunities.  FÁS operates the programme with a dedicated budget  of €34.5 million for 2010.  There are currently 1,329 participants, with this  number decreasing annually due to retirement and other reasons.Following changes introduced in 2004 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and  Employment, contracts for existing JI participants are renewed, allowing them  the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  There is no recruitment  to the programme due to this change.JI participants are involved in a wide range of useful community services,  including after-school care, breakfast clubs, homework clubs, gardening and  security services. In addition, JI projects provide jobs in the social economy  in administration and maintenance.  The areas supported by these workers include  community centres, creches, enterprise centres and parish properties.

The  Forfás  report, entitled A Review of Labour Market Programmes, was  published in February, 2010.On 23 March, 2010, the Taoiseach announced to the Dáil a number of Ministerial  and Departmental changes designed to ensure closer alignment of the  Government's economic objectives to the administrative functions of its  departments and agencies.   Following the enactment of the Social Welfare  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 in late July, the Department of Social  Protection will, after commencement of the relevant sections, assume overall  responsibility for the policy and funding of FÁS employment programmes  including Community Employment.I understand that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection intends to  bring forward more detailed legislative proposals at an early date to provide  for the full integration of the FÁS employment programmes and employment  services with his Department.

As a result of the discussions, agreement has been reached to  enable delivery of the training course in question which I understand will  commence very shortly.Agreement was also reached by all parties on the need to carry out a full  review of the training course.  I understand that the review will be carried  out with a view to its completion by the end of this year.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	824	On 22nd September 2010 the European Commission announced its approval of an  application from Ireland for European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF)  co-financing assistance in support of redundant workers formerly employed at  the S R Technics aircraft maintenance facility at Dublin airport.The EGF application is for a total of €11.46m of which the EU contribution  sought is €7.45m. The application remains to be approved by the Council of  Ministers and the European Parliament.In the interim national funding, in anticipation of subsequent EU reimbursement  up to specified limits, is being provided for the continued roll-out of  measures across a wide range of service providers currently which  former S R  Technics workers may avail of. These measures include occupational guidance,  training, educational opportunities and enterprise supports.For example, last week the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Lifelong  Learning, announced a new programme which commenced earlier this week to  facilitate former S R Technics apprentices to complete the on-the-job phases of  their apprenticeships with the Air Corps which will be co-financed with EGF  support.Tenders have been received under a public tendering exercise for a national  coordinator for EGF implementation and this process will be brought to  completion shortly. In the interim all State agencies and relevant educational  bodies involved in service provision for redundant S R Technics workers have  met to discuss how the current measures available can be intensified for the  remaining period of anticipated EGF funding.It is intended that an information event, such as was previously run last   December, will be run in the next few weeks to fully inform redundant S R  Technics workers of the services being made available. All eligible redundant  workers will be contacted individually in this regard.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The formal decision of the European budgetary authorities stipulates that the  financial contribution from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund approved  in support of redundant workers at the Dell plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick and  ancillary enterprises must be spent before 29th June 2011. The Fund, including  national contributions, may finance measures put in place to assist eligible  redundant workers since the announcement of their redundancy in early 2009.The emphasis in implementing measures supported by the Fund remains focused on  the continued provision of supports to individual redundant workers in the  areas of upskilling, retraining, educational opportunities and enterprise  supports rather than on a total expenditure figure.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	826	As of 27th September 2010 there are 4,676 people registered as lone parents on Community Employment (CE) schemes.  Since it is not relevant to their CE  participation, FÁS does not record information concerning participants in receipt of a Medical Card.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	827	Currently, 7,681 of a total of 18,494 apprentices are registered by FÁS as  being redundant.  Of this number, 4,392 can progress in their apprenticeship  having reached the minimum qualifying standard while 3,289 must first  successfully pass their outstanding assessment(s).FÁS has introduced a number of measures to date which have assisted over 4,000  redundant apprentices with on and off-the-job training.The rules for off-the-job training have been amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training phases. To date, 2,454 have completed off-the-job training and 1,133 are currently attending off-the-job training.  It is currently estimated that 3,587 redundant apprentices will benefit in 2010.The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme was introduced in April 2010 to provide opportunities to redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training at Phase 3, 5 and 7.  The scheme provides a weekly subsidy of €250 to the employer towards employment costs.  To date 240 have commenced their on-the-job training phase, of whom 14 have completed the relevant phase.ESB Networks are providing on-the-job training to 252 eligible redundant electrical and motor mechanics apprentices in 2010.  To date, 189 redundant apprentices have completed the training with 63 currently in training with ESB Networks.FÁS has also developed Phase 7 Equivalent off-the-job assessments for redundant apprentices for the trades of Carpentry & Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick & Stonelaying and Cabinet Making, where Phase 7 assessments cannot be undertaken on-the-job. Currently, 87 redundant apprentices have completed the assessments and a further 46 are scheduled to take the assessments.Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses and evening courses available at FÁS Training Centres to enhance their employable skills. Some 1,133 programmes have been availed of by redundant apprentices so far this year.Under the EU Leonardo Da Vinci III Life Long Learning Programme, Léargas in collaboration with FÁS, has supported 25 redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training overseas.  18 redundant apprentices are currently in on-the-job training overseas and 17 redundant apprentices will be scheduled for on-the-job training in the first half of 2011.FÁS, in consultation with the Department, continues to examine further  potential measures to facilitate the progression and completion of  apprenticeships. One such innovative approach was the taking on of a number of  former S.R. Technics apprentices by the Air Corps on a programme commencing  earlier this week, to enable them to complete Phases 5 and 7 of their  specialist on-the-job training.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 340 together.The number of mainstream class teachers appropriate to a school for the current  school year is determined by reference to the school's valid enrolment on 30  September, 2009 in accordance with the staffing schedule (Primary Circular  0021/2010) which is available on my Department's website. The additional posts  in the renewed Programme for Government enabled some improvement to be made to  the staffing schedule. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring  that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is  provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be  assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school  year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned  provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school  year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure  is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is also open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain  criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are  contained in the staffing schedule (Primary Circular 0021/2010).
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following table.As the figures show there has been a reduction in staffing across the  institutions since the introduction of the Government's recruitment and  promotion moratorium. The total number of whole time equivalent staff employed  in the third level institutions in question has decreased from 20,545 at 31  December, 2008 to 19,469 at 31 March, 2010 — a reduction of 1,076 (5.2%) in  whole-time equivalents.The purpose of the recruitment and promotion moratorium is to facilitate a  permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving and to  contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer.  In applying this  moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector  have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public  expenditure.  Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to  contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment  control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium  arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued  oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of  Finance. The Government is anxious to continue to work with the publicly funded  higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public  expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary  strategy.  The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing  a greater flexibility around recruitment in the filling of posts.  The current  framework, covering the period up to 31 December, 2010, requires the higher  education institutions to achieve a minimum 6% reduction in the number of  overall core staff by the end of 2010 as compared with the numbers in place at  31 December 2008.  Arrangements to apply thereafter will be communicated in due  course.It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions to manage their  staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework.UCDUCCNUIGNUIMTCDULDCUMICSPDNCADMDISt AngTotal

In reaching this decision, my Department considered the costs  associated with a relocation together with the fact that a building project is  being advanced which will provide a permanent solution to the long-term  accommodation needs of the school.  The school has since indicated to my  Department that it intends appealing this decision and will be seeking an  improved rental quotation from the landlord of the property in question.  Any  further correspondence received from the school will be considered by my  Department.I am pleased to confirm to the Deputies that the school was one of the school  building projects announced by the then Minister for Education and Science in  February 2010 to begin the design process and appoint design teams in the last  quarter of 2010.  My Department has advised the school authority that it will be  in contact with the school in due course regarding the appointment of a design  team.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	833	The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected  enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment  (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700  pupils by the year 2016.  Meeting this level of significant increased demand  for education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is  in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the  level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post  primary level up to 2017.  Overall post-primary requirements in the Carrigaline  area, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary  school will be considered in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework  in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their  patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage  Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in  relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views  and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward  Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my  Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.

Where buses over 20 years are in use, it is an  exceptional short-term measure and the buses involved are checked to ensure  that they continue to meet all statutory requirements and are also subject to  independent vehicle checks conducted by external experts on behalf of Bus  Éireann.Bus Éireann has advised that there are currently less than twenty buses over 20  years under contract nationally.In County Louth there are two buses over twenty years under contract and there  is an understanding that both these vehicles will be replaced by younger buses  by the end of this year.In addition to the 3,000 vehicles engaged under contract, Bus Éireann uses  approximately 600 of its own buses to provide school transport services. Of  these, five buses are over 20 years.

All students who are eligible under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge. The charge is paid on their behalf under my Department's student grant schemes by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to.The position is that the Higher Education institutions are autonomous institutions and my Department does not have any function in their day to day operational affairs, for which the Governing Bodies and the management staff of the institutions are responsible. The arrangements for the collection of the charge are a matter for each individual institution and accordingly I do not have a role in this matter.  However, I am confident that higher education institutions are dealing with students on this matter in a sensitive and compassionate manner.Students in need of help due to particular financial hardship may apply to the Access Officer in their institution for support from the Student Assistance Fund.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	836	The Department of Education and Science issued a circular to Irish-medium schools in 2007 stating that the teaching of English could not be delayed beyond the end of the first term in Junior Infants. The circular was the subject of an application for judicial review by An Foras Pátrúnachta and two Gaelscoileanna.Having considered submissions regarding proposals to prescribe the primary school curriculum by regulation and following discussions with Irish language interests, the Department is proposing to proceed by introducing a regulation that will prescribe the primary curriculum. The regulation will stipulate that the teaching of English may be delayed in Irish-medium schools up to the end of the first term of senior infants, subject to the approval of the school's board of management and following consultation with the patron, teachers and parents' association. The Minister intends to provide a copy of the draft regulation to the education partners and Irish language organisations shortly, prior to laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This will be done when legal work on the preparation of the regulation is completed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations including the payment of examiners and superintendents.Persons engaged by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) on contract work in the conduct of the examinations (such as superintendents, examiners, etc) are liable to the Pension Related Deduction (PRD) if they meet the conditions of eligibility as set down in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Therefore if they are public servants and members of public service pension schemes or if they are in receipt of pension or in receipt of benefit in lieu of membership of a public service pension scheme, they are liable to have PRD applied to their examinations earnings.  The treatment of PRD by the State Examinations Commissions is in line with the legislation and instructions from the Department of Finance.The thresholds for application of the different rates of PRD are calculated on an individual's overall reckonable earnings. The instructions issued by the Department of Finance to Departments and agencies in 2009 indicate that eligible persons in subsidiary public service employment should have the top rate of PRD applied to those subsidiary earnings.I understand that a PRD deduction is not made by SEC where an examiner is not a public servant or eligible to benefit from a public service pension scheme or a benefit in lieu.  However, the majority of examiners are either serving or retired teachers to whom a PRD deduction applies under the Act. The fact that examination earnings are not pensionable does not alter this position under the Acts.The application of PRD to examinations contract earnings reflects the reality that most persons engaged on examinations contract work are members of the teaching profession.  While the sums that they receive from the SEC may be under the PRD minimum threshold of €15,000 per annum, their overall public service earnings would be far in excess of this amount.  In order to ensure that the Exchequer receives the correct benefit of this deduction the SEC generally applies PRD at the top rate of 10.5% to examinations contract work.All contract personnel have been provided with clear information on how the deduction applies and have had an opportunity to notify the SEC that they are exempt from the deduction or that a lower rate of PRD should apply.  For example a retired teacher already in receipt of a teacher's pension has the option of nominating the SEC as their main employer in which case PRD applies only to their examinations earnings.The majority of those employed on contract work on the certificate examinations are members of the teaching profession.  While their examinations earnings may not be pensionable, they will receive a public service pension on retirement, and accordingly, the PRD deduction applies to their subsidiary public service employment earnings under the Act.

However, a number of projects based elsewhere in the country are providing multi-region programmes that include course places for unemployed people in Cork.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.In the course of the 2009/10 school year a number of parents residing in the Brownstown area contacted my Department regarding the availability of seats on the bus servicing the area and the route travelled by this bus.During the summer break, Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department reviewed the school transport services for the Brownstown area. Part of this review included an assessment of the number and location of eligible pupils and the routing and time tabling of the existing service.A service has now been established to cater for eligible pupils and the families in question have been notified.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. The study indicated that the requirement for additional primary provision in the short to medium term is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. Knocklyon was not included in these initial identified areas.The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at primary level increase from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 563,300 pupils by the year 2016.  Meeting this level of significant increased demand for education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department will continue to analyse demographic trends to determine the level of additional provision which will be required into the future. Overall requirements in the Knocklyon area will be considered in this context.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.The Deputy may be aware that a Common Application System was agreed between the Patrons/Trustees and principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City.  This system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre with support from my Department. This administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.The National Educational Welfare Board is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place or temporary educational provision for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

Under the terms of these Acts, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institutes are matters for which the Governing Bodies and the management of the institutes are responsible.  Accordingly my Department does not collect details of travel and subsistence payments to members of the Governing Bodies.

Department circular M10/94 applies to post primary schools funded by my Department and sets out the conditions under which an exemption from the study of Irish may be granted to post primary pupils.  Under the terms of this circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, is vested in school management.With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the position is that the pupil's parents/guardians should make a written application to the management of the school in which the pupil is enrolled, clearly stating the grounds on which they are seeking an exemption from the study of Irish.

Donegal projects referred to by him, is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.For the Deputy's convenience, a list of applications for major capital projects for Co.

Students should apply to their local authority or VEC to establish their eligibility.Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.The assessment of means under my Department's third level student grant schemes is based on gross income from all sources, with specified social welfare and health service executive payments being excluded from the calculation.  In the case of applicants classed as independent mature students, their own earnings and those of their spouse are normally subject to assessment.Where students do not qualify to have tuition fees paid on their behalf, tax relief is available at the standard rate of tax for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges and universities. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.

The scheme is operated by a number of higher education institutions and not by my Department.  Admissions to the institutions are regulated by the institutions themselves.  The Deputy may wish to contact the Irish Universities Association in this instance.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	852	I propose to take Questions Nos. 204, 295 and 296 together.The Review of Labour Market Programmes, carried out by FORFÁS on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and published in February this year, made several recommendations aimed at ensuring that labour market programmes run by FÁS and Skillnets will better deliver on labour market objectives.  The programmes examined by FORFÁS were developed at various times to respond to identified needs for training or skills in the labour market. As such they are subject to ongoing review and modification. Where applicable the recommendations are being taken on board by both organisations in formulating their strategy and provision of programmes, within the context of their own specific remits.The Government has also made several decisions, which have had a direct impact on the programmes being provided to the unemployed. In Budget 2010, the Government announced that FÁS training allowances would be aligned to a person's entitlement to supports for jobseekers and Department of Social and Family Affairs rules.In addition, in order to minimise the drift into very long-term unemployment and in response to concerns that certain individuals who, without special attention, are likely to be most at risk of becoming distant from the labour market, the Government decided to prioritise four cohorts of the unemployed for support. These are as follows:People with low skills or education levels,People who are on the Live Register for over one year;People who are under 35 years of age,People who were previously employed in sectors that have been most affected by restructuring and where recovery to near previous levels is not in prospect in the short to medium term (mainly construction, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade).As a result of this decision, my Department instructed FÁS that at least 80% of its training and work experience places for the unemployed must be offered to an individual from one of the priority cohorts. As of the end of June 2010, over 90% of FÁS trainees come from the priority cohorts and the overall target is being exceed for each individual programme.  This decision has resulted in FÁS placing an enhanced focus on delivering training to those on the Live Register to improve their chances of securing employment. In addition FÁS training provision continues to be updated so that it meets employers skills requirements at a local and a national level.In 2010 Skillnets has been providing for the inclusion in its training networks programme (TNP) of limited numbers of unemployed persons with the emphasis, where possible, on the priority cohorts on the live register. To date, the numbers of unemployed persons participating under the TNP have been limited to ensure the focus on enterprise-led training is maintained to the benefit of both employed and unemployed participants.

Such programmes would also have academic accreditation from an awarding body such as a university or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC).  While academic and professional bodies work together to co-ordinate their accreditation activities, it is common for there to be some divergence in requirements.HETAC accredits a number of programmes offered by the provider in question.  All providers offering HETAC awards are subject to external quality assurance review of their institutions.  The college in question was recently the subject of an Institutional Review carried out by HETAC, and the report published following this review made several recommendations to the college. The implementation of these recommendations will be monitored by HETAC.The CAO is a private body and receives no State funding. The higher education institutions have delegated to the CAO the task of processing centrally applications for admission to their first year undergraduate courses. Neither my Department nor HETAC has any role to play in relation to the operation of the CAO.As the provider in question receives no state funding, my Department does not have a direct role in this matter.  I understand that HETAC has played a key role in making alternative arrangements available to the students involved.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	854	My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and my predecessor Minister Hanafin announced in March 2007 that a support and development initiative for the Irish language under the aegis of An Chomhaire um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta would be located at Coláiste Íosagáin in Baile Bhúirne and that four additional staff would be assigned to An Chomairle for this purpose.  The intention was to provide a key resource that will support and contribute to a national strategy for Irish at all levels of the education system. The capital costs were to be funded by Udaras na Gaeltachta. The commitment to proceed with the centre has been reiterated in the context of the 20 year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.My Department is not in a position to proceed with this initiative in the current budgetary climate. However, the matter will be kept under review, and it is the intention that the project will proceed as soon as resources allow.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	855	From September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  The decision was taken to discontinue the practice of allowing students progressing to a new course to hold both the BTEA and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments. This measure was recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes. However, the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges for the students concerned will continue to be met for these students by the Exchequer, subject to the means test and other grant eligibility requirements.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.This means that, where an applicant enrolled on two-year course in the 2009/2010 academic year, the student in question will continue to be eligible for consideration for both the BTEA or VTOS allowance and the student maintenance grant for the 2010/11 academic year.  If the student enrolled on a one-year course in the 2009/2010 academic year and is commencing a further one-year course in 2010/11, the applicant will be ineligible to hold both payments as he/she will be moving to a new course.The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant's local authority or VEC. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining clearly the grounds for the appeal.Individual local authorities and VECs have been issued with detailed advice by my Department on the operation of the aspects of the schemes referred to by the Deputy.  In addition, comprehensive information for students on financial support for further and higher education in 2010/11 for those on social welfare or BTEA has been made available on the studentfinance.ie website, including detailed case studies.  This information was developed by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection, the National Access Office of the HEA, AMA — the third level Access Officers' network, Citizens Information and USI, the Union of Students in Ireland.

The OMCYA has now formally agreed to the transfer of 21 of the projects to the OMCYA as they are considered to be more appropriately related to the specific youth work activities of that Office.In relation to a number of other projects it has been decided, following consideration, to integrate them with local School Completion Programme projects which are funded under the provision for Social Inclusion measures and supports.Decisions on the future location of the administration of the remaining small number of projects have not, as yet, been taken.  These are currently under review.

In turn, arrangements are being put in place to facilitate implementation in each sector including the Education sector.Officials of my Department have had engagements with a number of unions about the specific commitments contained in the Agreement.  Not all unions have accepted the Public Service Agreement, and this poses particular difficulties in the Education sector.Officials of my Department met recently with the Public Service Agreement Implementation Body to discuss the strategy for implementation of the Agreement in the Education sector.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.There are four band ratings under the prioritisation criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's  website.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all  assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.

These figures are net of income from fees. The 2010 allocation is €54.510m.The outturn figure for the National Educational Welfare Board in 2008 was €10.085m, the 2009 figure was €9.630m. The 2010 allocation is €9.575m.The Education Finance Board is funded from the contribution provided by the 18 religious congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement with €12.7m  specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families.  For the Deputy's information grants amounting to €1.811m for 2008  and €1.637m for 2009 respectively were paid from this fund. The balance in the  fund available to the Board as of end 2009 was €5.35m.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected  enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700  pupils by the year 2016. Meeting this level of significant increased demand for education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is  in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the  level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017.  Overall post-primary requirements in the Midleton  and Carrigtwohill areas and the remainder of East Cork area, will be considered  in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework  in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	861	Notwithstanding the difficult budgetary climate the Government has tried, as best as possible, to protect the front line services in the education sector.  Unlike other areas of the public service teaching vacancies continue to be filled. Indeed the number of teaching posts is increasing due to demographics and the allocation of the additional posts in the renewed Programme for Government.When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at Assistant Principal and Special Duties level arise due to retirements in these specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts. What the  school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher. The position whereby just over 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.Some further limited alleviation was announced in July for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level.  The alleviation arrangements are set out in the published Department Circular  42/2010. It provides some delegated sanction for post-primary schools to fill  Assistant Principal vacancies if they fall below certain minimum thresholds.The filling of these posts will be notified by the relevant post-primary  schools to the Department over the coming weeks. Applications for alleviation  have also been received from over 110 primary schools and these are currently  being examined and prioritised and the schools will be advised of the outcome  in the coming weeks.

The administration of individual cases is  a day-to-day matter for FÁS as part of its responsibility under the Labour  Services Act 1987.Eligibility to participate on a CE scheme is linked to the length of time a  person is in receipt of Social Welfare benefits. However, the local FÁS office  assists all jobseekers who wish to attend a training course.

The appeal has been  considered and I am happy to inform the Deputy that the school has been  approved funding towards external works. A letter dated 19th July 2010 was  issued to the school authority informing them of the decision.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	864	The Programme, referred to by the Deputy, is operated by the Northside  Partnership and encourages the participation of young people from the Dublin 17  area in education to the highest levels possible.Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central  elements of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) — the Action  Plan for Educational Inclusion. Targeted interventions include Home School  Community Liaison services, additional funding for pupils at risk of early  school leaving, alternative curricular options and the School Completion  Programme. The School Completion Programme is an initiative with a broad-based approach which my Department has adopted to tackle early school leaving.My Department currently targets the Dublin 17 area through the School Completion Programme. This programme aims to have a positive impact on levels of pupil retention in primary and second level schools and on the number of pupils who successfully complete the Senior Cycle, or equivalent.  The  Programme entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both  in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  In Dublin 17 five primary schools and one post-primary school participate in the School Completion Programme (SCP).  An allocation of €316,340 was made to this SCP in 2009/10.This funding allocation is additional to regular funding. A second SCP in Dublin 17 is a targeted education initiative for teenage Travellers who do not enrol in mainstream second-level education.  The funding allocation for this initiative in 2009/10 was €97,670.The National Educational Welfare Board was established under the Education  Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to  school.  The remit of the Board was expanded in 2009 to include responsibility  for the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team. The new integrated approach will provide for better targeting of children who are not benefiting from education. It will ensure that these children are properly supported to maximise their educational potential through improved attendance at and participation in school. It also provides new  opportunities for enhanced support for parents and families.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	865	The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been progressing the  development of a new subject "Politics and Society", which is proposed as an  optional examinable full subject in the Leaving Certificate. A draft syllabus  has been developed by the Council and was published for consultation. The  syllabus is currently being revised in the light of the feedback. After this process has been completed, the Council's formal proposals on the matter will be submitted to me, and will be considered in the light of overall system needs and priorities.It should be noted that education for citizenship is covered extensively in the  curriculum for primary schools as part of Social Personal and Health Education,  and History, Geography and Science. At second level, these themes are continued, and Civic Social and Political Education is a mandatory subject  for all pupils in the junior cycle. It is examined in the Junior Certificate by means of a written terminal examination and an innovative action project which is designed to give students a practical experience of active citizenship.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	866	Student grants are payable to eligible students at either what is known as an adjacent or a non-adjacent rate.  These rates of grant take into consideration that additional expenses may accrue for students whose home address is a significant distance from the institution they attend.The adjacent rate of grant, which ranges from €330 to €2,680 depending on  individual circumstances, is payable where a student's normal residence is 24  Kilometres or less from the college which he/she is attending.  The non-adjacent rate of grant, which ranges from €810 to €6,355 again, depending on individual circumstances, is payable in all other cases.Students in need of extra help due to particular financial circumstances may  apply to the Access Officer in their institution for support from the Student  Assistance Fund.In the last Budget, a decision was taken to discontinue the practice of  allowing students progressing to a new course to hold both the BTEA and a  student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of  income support payments.  This measure was recommended in the Report of the  Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  However, the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges for the students concerned will continue to be met for these students by the Exchequer, subject to the means test and other grant eligibility requirements.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA and the maintenance grant will  continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes.The BTEA is a Department of Social Protection second-chance education  opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain  social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce. Eligibility for, and the payment structure of the BTEA is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social protection.

Due to commercial sensitivities pertaining to site  acquisitions generally it is not the Department's policy to provide details of  the purchase cost of sites so recently acquired or any information in respect  of sites acquired in 2010 as this information could prejudice ongoing negotiations for school sites.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The new entry process for admission to medical schools arose from a recommendation of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education &  Training (the Fottrell report). This report formed the basis for a programme of reform and expansion of medical education and training in Ireland that was approved by the Government in 2006. Following this a group of representatives  from the Medical Schools and University Admissions Offices was established to  examine the implementation of revised entry criteria, having regard to the Fottrell recommendation that entry to undergraduate medical education programmes should not be exclusively coupled with Leaving Cert. performance. It was ultimately decided by the medical schools that from 2009 entry to the undergraduate medical programme would be based on combination of Leaving Cert results and performance in an independent admissions test (HPAT) designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills.As this is only the second year of operation of the new entry mechanism, it  would be premature to seek to form any firm conclusions in relation to its impact. I understand that a research group comprising representation from the Council of Deans of Faculties with Medical Schools of Ireland (CDFMSI), admission officers, the Central Applications Office, Irish medical education experts and international advisers has been convened for the purpose of ongoing evaluation of the entry process. This group will examine the concurrent and predictive validity of the new entry mechanisms as well as the impact on the socio-demographic composition of successful medical school entrants. The work of this group will inform a review of the new mechanism which will be undertaken within 3 years of its introduction.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I propose to take Questions Nos. 235 and 242 together.A project to provide permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the  Deputies involves the acquisition of a site. I am pleased to advise the Deputies that contracts for the provision of a site are now being exchanged and my Department understands that the Chief State Solicitor's Office are in contact with their counterparts to close the exchange of the contracts.The progression of a building project for the school from initial design stage through to construction phase will then be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital  budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project for the school at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	872	Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the  case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and  second-level schools are taken at school level, and I have no plans to regulate  this area.Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to  textbooks, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date. School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.The Deputy will be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government provides for funding to be made available to allow schools to provide grant assistance for books. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that €14.65m for grant assistance for books is being made available in 2010 for schools at primary and second level.  Schools are encouraged to put in place book rental schemes, as this is the most  effective means of reducing costs for all parents.Given the range of subjects, programmes, class groups and levels across the  education system, and the wide variety of sources from which educational  materials can be drawn in the Information Society, it is not feasible for my  Department to assume a central tendering function for each textbook.  To do so  would stifle choice for schools and the opportunity to ensure that they can access the most suitable resources to meet their respective needs.

The broadband connections are broken down as follows:ADSL: 79;Wireless: 7;Satellite: 32.100Mbit/s pilot project — post primary schools: 2 (this is out of a total of 78  schools nationwide)
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The Deputy may be aware that under the Area Development Plan for the N4/M4  corridor, published by the Commission on School Accommodation in May 2005,  provision of a new post primary school for Enfield is recommended post 2011.The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected  enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment  (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700  pupils by the year 2016. Meeting this level of significant increased demand for  education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is  in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the  level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017.Overall post-primary requirements in the Enfield area, including the case for  the provision of a new post-primary school will be considered in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework  in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward  Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.The NCSE is committed to exercising its role in relation to the allocation of  teaching hours and Special Needs Assistants to schools to support the education  of children with special educational needs in a way that is fair, consistent  and transparent. The NCSE has introduced an appeals procedure which can now be viewed in full on its website — www.ncse.ie.It is open to a school to appeal a SENO's decision under this appeals process.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	880	Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are allocated to schools to enable them to  support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. The  National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its  network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource  teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational  needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such  support.The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on  a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs  leaving, the number of new pupils and the changing needs of the pupils. While  SNA posts may be allocated to schools in line with my Department's criteria,  SNA posts may also be suppressed where a child may leave or move school, or may achieve a greater level of independence.A Special Needs Assistant whose post is surplus to the approved allocation to  the school may be entitled to a redundancy payment under the terms of circular  58/2006 — titled Redundancy Arrangements for Special Need Assistants. Support  to SNAs who may have been made redundant is provided for within the terms of  this scheme.

Depending on the nature of the course to be pursued,  this will be either a student's local authority or VEC.As a decision on grant entitlement can only be taken on foot of a fully  completed application form and the necessary supporting documentation, it is in  the student's best interests to submit these to the relevant grant awarding  authority immediately.  It may be helpful to the student to access the  studentfinance.ie website to ascertain which grant awarding authority is  appropriate to her situation.  Application forms are also available on this  website.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	882	It is the policy of my Department that only qualified personnel should be  employed by schools. Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in  exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting  qualified personnel have been exhausted and only for quite limited time periods.This is now reflected in Circular 40/2010 which my Department issued earlier  this year.  Under its terms, schools are directed to ensure that teachers  proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the  Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable  to the post for which they are proposed.  Where an employer can satisfactorily  demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an  appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified and/or  unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an  appropriately qualified and registered teacher and this provision must be  inserted in the employment contract. The employer shall repeat the process to  recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of  any such contract and in any event within the school year. The person recruited  will be remunerated at the unqualified rate.As the Deputy is aware, the Teaching Council was established under the Teaching Council Act 2001, in March 2006 to promote teaching as a profession and the professional development of teachers, to maintain and improve the quality of teaching in the State, to provide for the establishment of standards, policies and procedures for the education and training of teachers, and to provide for the registration and regulation of teachers and to enhance professional  standards and competence.As it is desirable that there be a fully trained professional body of teachers  the Teaching Council aims to promote and maintain the highest standards of  teaching, learning and professional conduct in our schools.In common with most self-regulated professions, the Teaching Council has  established and maintains a register of its members, as provided for under Part  3 of the Teaching Council Act 2001. The register of teachers is intended to  function as the main regulatory instrument of the Teaching Council. It stands  as a verifiable expression of the standard of teaching, knowledge, skill and  competence that teachers aspire to have and maintain. To be registered, a  teacher must have attained a satisfactory level of professional qualification  and training. Thus, the register is intended to act as a statement of the  standards required of teachers. Only persons who reach these standards will be  able to work as teachers in State funded positions, except in limited time  bound circumstances.In recent years the supply of qualified teachers has increased thus reducing  the need for schools to employ unqualified teachers.Persons who were not qualified but were employed as a teacher in a recognised  school, and paid out of  moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or eligible to be  so employed on establishment of the Teaching Council were allowed to become  registered under Section 31(2) of the Teaching Council Act 2001.For these persons, and others who may have worked as substitute teachers on a temporary basis, it is possible to become formally qualified through a  Postgraduate Diploma in Education held in the four publicly-funded Colleges of  Education, and the private college, Hibernia, for the purpose of enabling third  level graduates to qualify as primary teachers. Persons who successfully  complete this course may be registered by the Teaching Council as qualified for  service in the State's primary schools.Under the primary school teachers pension scheme the service of persons  employed in primary schools in an untrained capacity is pensionable on an  ongoing basis where that service is given from 1 September 2001, subject to  payment of appropriate pension contributions. In addition persons giving  service on or after that date, may also reckon service given prior to 1  September 2001 for pension purposes subject to satisfying certain thresholds,  terms and conditions including verification of the service and payment of  appropriate pension contributions.

The information  includes the number of pupils in each class and the number of pupils in each  class size range.The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published  annually on my Department's website. In terms of the position at individual  school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by  my Department for the 2009-2010 school year was the pupil enrolment at 30  September 2008. While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an  average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its  classes.The Deputy will be aware that the renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government. The renewed Programme for Government also provides for 500 teaching posts to schools over the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	886	The Deputy will be aware that the current difficult economic circumstances have  necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure  sustainability in the long run. In these circumstances, from September 2010, as  announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to  Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC  courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants. The cost of the  student services charge and tuition fees payable to colleges will continue to  be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both  the BTEA or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.  This measure was  recommended by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure  Programmes, with an estimated saving for the 2010 financial year of €4m and a  full financial year saving of some €35m.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the  maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the  duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and  conditions of the relevant grant schemes. Students progressing to a new course  with effect from 2010/11 will no longer be eligible for student maintenance  grants but can continue to apply for assistance towards the cost of the student  services charge and any fees payable.

Meeting this level of significant increased demand for  education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is  in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the  level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post  primary level up to 2017. Overall post-primary requirements in the Dublin 16  area, which includes the school to which the Deputy refers, will be considered  in this context.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward  Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my  Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

In addition, the Provider is to be a  certified approved provider under the NFQ.Should a training intervention be identified that is not within the NFQ, this  may be approved by the local FÁS Employment Services Manager.  Grants for  programmes not on the NFQ will only be approved for other ‘legitimately'  certified or ‘approved' programmes.In 2009 in excess of 12,000 grants were approved and at the end of August 2010, 11,291 grants have been approved.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	891	The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the  managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to  intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main  responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater  for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not  obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement  an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard  a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children  from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis  of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on  which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in  respect of all applicants.The Deputy may be aware that a Common Application System was agreed between the Patrons / Trustees and principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City.  This system has been facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre with  support from my Department. This administrative system ensures that a  coordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process  where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the  Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil,  the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the  Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational  Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. An appeal  under Section 29, for the person mentioned in the question, has been taken to  my Department, however, the appeal was not upheld.The National Educational Welfare Board is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place or temporary educational provision for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.

The school management  authorities were advised that they could utilise this grant to purchase  temporary accommodation or to build a permanent structure. I understand that  the school authorities have decided to provide a permanent structure.Additional funding has been allocated to the school authorities to provide a  pedestrian ramp at the school.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	893	In 2004, agreement was reached to amalgamate the school referred to by the  Deputy and one other primary school in the town. An application was made for  capital funding towards the amalgamation project. It was assessed and the  project was assigned a band rating of 1.4.A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to  determine which would be suitable to facilitate the amalgamated school. The  report produced following this inspection concluded that the most suitable  building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girls' school. It also  found that an additional portion of land would be required from the Sisters of  Mercy to facilitate the development. The Sisters of Mercy have indicated that  they would, in principle, be disposed to selling land to the Department to  facilitate the proposed works.The progression of this building project and the acquisition of the additional  land required to facilitate the amalgamation, will be considered in the context  of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my  Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.

As the Deputy may be aware, a new national strategy for higher education  has been under development by a high level group chaired by Dr Colin Hunt.    The question of how Ireland's higher education system should be configured to  best meet the  challenges of the next two decades has been under consideration  as part of this work.  I have now been presented with the Group's report and  will be consulting with my Government colleagues in relation to its findings in  the coming weeks.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	896	I propose to take Questions Nos. 262, 301 and 307 together.The Deputies will be aware that the National Council for Special Education  (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the  appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special  educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.The Deputies will also be aware that the enrolment of a child in a school is a  matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of  Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing  applications for enrolment in schools.The NCSE has advised my Department that the school concerned had sufficient  teaching resources in place to cater for the special educational needs of all  of the pupils proposed for enrolment at the beginning of the school year. I  understand that the NCSE is actively engaging with the school authorities to  ensure that any outstanding applications for support will be processed once the  appropriate information has been provided to the school's assigned Special  Educational Needs Organiser (SENO).I can confirm that my Department has been in contact with the school in  question, by letter of 3rd September, to clarify issues raised by them in  relation to the school's enrolment policy and also to advise of the role of the  NCSE regarding the determination of support levels for pupils with special  educational needs in special schools.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special  educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.I wish to assure the Deputies that supports will continue to be made available  to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support and children  with special educational needs will continue to have access to an appropriate  education in line with my Department's policy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	897	I wish to advise the Deputy that I have consistently encouraged schools to put  in place book rental schemes as the most effective means of lowering costs for  all parents.In accordance with the Renewed Programme for Government, my Department issued funding to schools in June to enable them to provide assistance for school  books.Details of the funding were notified to schools by circulars 0041/2010 (second  level) and 0043/2010 (first level), which are available on my Department's  website.  In these circulars, schools were urged to use this funding to  establish book rental schemes.In total, €14.6 Million issued to schools.  Funding was allocated as follows:€11 per pupil in primary schools;€21 per pupil in primary schools within the Delivering Equality in Schools  (DEIS) scheme;€24 per pupil in post-primary; or€39 per pupil in post-primary schools within the DEIS scheme.In the majority of cases, my Department does not have a role in recommending,  endorsing or approving textbooks.  Apart from a small number of prescribed  texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on  which textbooks to use are taken at school level.Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes,  primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. School  authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent  that is absolutely necessary.

FÁS does not deliver any programmes in shotfiring or explosives supervision. These programmes can only be delivered by approved training organisations which are registered on the FÁS/Enterprise Ireland National Register of Trainers.FÁS does not certify these programmes but does, in accordance with its quality  assurance arrangements with FETAC, process requests from approved training  organizations for FETAC certification.Under these schemes, FÁS is required to issue registration cards for specified  tasks following successful completion of the relevant training, assessment and  certification.  Registration cards are issued on the basis of the relevant  FETAC award or a recognised equivalent to the FETAC award including a  recognised equivalent award in another Member State of the European  Communities.

In 2009 in excess of 12,000 grants were approved and at the end of August 2010, 11,291 grants have been approved.The Technical Employment Support Grant (TESG) is used where a FÁS Employment Services Officer, during the course of a guidance interview, identifies that a particular category of jobseeker has a support need in order to enter/re-enter the labour market, and that this need cannot be met by FÁS directly or any other state provider within a reasonable period of time or location.  A fund of up to €500 per jobseeker or 100% of the cost of the programme, whichever is the lesser amount, may be available for qualifying jobseekers.  The TESG grant should not be combined with Department of Social Protection grants and/or the Local Employment Service Mediator Fund grants.The programme should be accredited up to and including FETAC level 6 or equivalent awards on Ireland's National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and the Provider is to be a certified approved provider under the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  Should a training intervention be identified that is not within the NFQ, this may be approved by the local FÁS Employment Services Manager.  Grants for programmes not on the NFQ will only be approved for other ‘legitimately' certified or ‘approved' programmes.The administration of individual cases is a day-to-day matter for FÁS as part of its responsibility under the Labour Services Act 1987.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	909	I propose to take Questions Nos. 275, and 318 to 320, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.I wish to clarify for the Deputy that there has been no change to the policies which underpin the allocation of SNA support to schools.  SNA posts continue to be retained, and new posts sanctioned, where the care needs of pupils meet the criteria for the scheme.  However, there is no question of posts being left in schools where they are deemed to be surplus to pupils' care needs.  At a time of constrained resources it is essential that we ensure that public resources, both staff and resources, are deployed as effectively as possible.  Resources left in an area that are not in accordance with criteria mean public resources are not available for another deserving area.I am providing information to the Deputy in relation to the number of SNAs as at the end of December in each of the years in question.  The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of SNA posts in September of each year is not readily available.  I can confirm for the Deputy that there were 9,824 whole-time equivalent SNAs employed in schools at end-December 2007; 10,442 at end-December 2008 and 10,342 at end-December 2009.  There were 10,348 whole-time equivalent SNAs employed in schools at end-June 2010.I have arranged for the details requested by the Deputy in relation to pupils in receipt of SNA support to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

With this in mind my Department is engaged in the process of acquiring a site and to this end has applied for planning permission as part of the exchange of contracts.  The future Patronage of any schools constructed on this property will be in the context of the educational demand in the area and the outcome of the application for planning permission.  When the acquisition of a suitable site is concluded, the proposed building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	915	The Residential Institutions Redress Scheme was introduced in 2002 as an exceptional measure to address a very particular circumstance, namely abuse in residential care and was never intended to be a panacea for every injustice committed on children.  The issue of including the Bethany Home in the scheme was considered previously when it was decided not to include it.  Following the publication of the Ryan Report in May 2009, there were a range of demands for the redress scheme to be extended to include specific institutions, including the Bethany Home. as well as specific categories of institutions.  The Government considered these demands and in its statement of 15th April last noted that it did not propose to revise the arrangements.Recent media attention has focussed on the certification of Bethany House as a place of detention by the Minister for Justice in 1945 under section 108 of the Children Act, 1908.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform has advised that it has not received any allegations of abuse from any female committed to Bethany House pursuant to the 1908 Children Act and that it would be happy to deal with any such cases on an individual basis.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	916	As part of Budget 2010, it was announced that the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) would explore, with my Department and FÁS,  the potential to rationalise child care support schemes with the objective of delivering improved supports in a more efficient, transparent and equitable way.Following discussions, the OMCYA established the Childcare Education and Training Scheme (CETS).  The CETS commenced in September 2010 and is designed to provide free child care places to participants in a range of full-time and part-time VEC further education and FÁS training programmes.  Under the previous child care support schemes, parents received a partial subsidy of child care costs.In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, officials in my Department have been in contact with the relevant VEC and the OMCYA in order to resolve this issue.  I should note that the CETS is open to participants on the same range of programmes that the previous schemes had provided for, which includes participants in the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS).The operation of the CETS will be kept under review by the OMCYA and my Department.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	923	The Short Time Working Training Programme was introduced in May 2009.  FÁS administered the programme, which provided training to people on systematic short time for the days they were not working.  The programme aimed to provide two days training a week for up to 277 workers.  The Department of Social Protection continued to pay participants social welfare entitlements whilst they received this training.  A total of 236 people participated on the programme and a further 20 currently remain on it.Valuable experience and lessons have been learned during the operation of the Short Time Working Programme and this has facilitated Skillnets and has assisted them in their preparations for including unemployed people in their Training Networks Programme.  It is intended that this will also include provision for some people on reduced working weeks.  Skillnets are now providing training to approximately 10,000 unemployed persons.

The programme includes the provision to ring-fence 250 places for under 25s.  Participation on the programme is voluntary and unpaid while participants on the programme may be entitled to maintain their social welfare entitlements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.  This Programme is designed to address an identified gap in policy provision for those unemployed people who need more experience to make them more attractive to employers.  This will assist them in securing paid employment in the future.As of 16th September 1,860 people had commenced a placement under the Work Placement Programme.  918 had taken up graduate placements and 942 commenced non-graduate placements.The total number of places filled by young persons under 25 years old on the programme is 563.  This includes 294 on the graduate stream and 269 on the non-graduate stream.

The design team submitted an application for planning permission for the new school during the summer and are currently dealing with a request for further information from the Local Authority.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The proposed building project for Clifden Community School, Co. Galway will continue to be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2011 and subsequent years.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	929	I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has submitted an application for major capital funding for a new 16 classroom school.  The application was assessed and assigned a Band rating of 1.1.  The proposed project was subsequently announced to commence Architectural Planning in November 2006.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.My Department has been in ongoing communication with officials in Galway County Council in relation to acquiring a suitable site for Gaelscoil de hÍde and has recently met with senior officials from the local authority to agree on the best approach to acquiring this site subject to planning permission.  To this end my Department will now commence the preparation of a planning application in respect of the site negotiated by the Local Authority.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.  However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	930	The Deputy may be aware that under the Area Development Plan for South Galway 2007-2012, published by the Commission on School Accommodation in January 2008, provision of a new post primary school for Claregalway is recommended by circa 2016.The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700 pupils by the year 2016.  Meeting this level of significant increased demand for education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017.  Overall post-primary requirements in the Claregalway area, will be considered in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	931	The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant's local authority or VEC.  An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining clearly the grounds for the appeal.No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy.Under the student maintenance grant schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for financial assistance where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, age, nationality and previous academic attainment.For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students.  A mature student is defined as a person of not less than 23 years of age in the year of entry to an approved course.  An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account.  Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income.  The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate for different classes of applicants.  This power would enable me, if there were compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider the circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental income.  The Deputy will appreciate that any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent mature student would have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very specific circumstances where students could demonstrate that they have been genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a period before the commencement of their studies.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.Schools apply to their local SENO for SNA resources as new pupils who would qualify for such support are enrolled or as the changing care needs of existing pupils emerge.  The allocation for any school, and any adjustments to that allocation, depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply in this regard.The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of SNAs in schools in County Mayo is not readily available.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	933	Under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Initiative the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved institution.  The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  Students with official refugee status in the State who meet the criteria of the scheme may also be considered under the Free Fees Initiative.  Any such amendment to the residency rule as requested by the Deputy could not apply in isolation to returning Irish emigrants as the scheme must be applied to all EU/EEA/Swiss nationals on the same basis.The assessment of eligibility under the Free Fees Initiative in individual cases is a matter for each higher education institution to determine within the terms of the scheme.  I have no plans to amend the residency rule of the scheme.Where undergraduate students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees initiative such students must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution.  However, tax relief, can be claimed for tuition fees paid in respect of approved undergraduate courses at approved colleges of higher education in the State and any other E.U. Member State.

Of these, 1936 were considered eligible for the probationary process.  Of those eligible, 489 were in permanent positions.  Of the eligible 489, 477 were assigned to an inspector who would have completed the probationary process unless unforeseen circumstances arose.  Those cases not assigned in 2009/10 will, following application for probation in 2010/11, be prioritised for inspection.  In respect of the 477 cases assigned in 2009/10, the position is that, to date, 342 have been deemed satisfactory, 7 have been deemed unsatisfactory and reports are awaited in the remaining cases.Figures on the number of schools with unprobated teachers in temporary or substitute roles are being compiled and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 1 rating.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.In the meantime, the school has been provided with temporary accommodation to meet its needs.

Registered with the Teaching Council in accordance with Section 31 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001and2. Have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which s/he is proposed.The Circular allows for two exceptions to apply:a) Where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified and/or unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher and this provision must be inserted in the employment contract.  The employer shall repeat the process to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of any such contract and in any event within the school year.  The person recruited will be remunerated at the unqualified rate.b) In the case of an appointee who has applied to the Teaching Council, remuneration will be at the rate for unqualified persons pending the decision of the Council.  This provision must be inserted in the employment contract.  When registration for the sector and recognition of qualifications for the purpose of the post is achieved then incremental salary will be allowed from the date of registration.  Otherwise the employer shall repeat the recruitment process within the school year.  (A copy of the full Circular Letter is attached for the information of the Deputy).In the 2009/10 school year 129 primary and 33 post-primary unqualified staff were employed on contract for the school year.

Unqualified personnel should not be appointed except in exceptional circumstances and then only when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted and even then only for quite limited time periods.  It is for this reason that Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 is to be amended.  These amendments are contained in the Education (Amendment) Bill which was published yesterday.  The amendment of the section will include provision for it to be regulated that a school may only employ unregistered personnel on a time limited basis in exceptional circumstances.

Cycle to Work Scheme

For 2011 and Subsequent Years 

1 INTRODUCTION
The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform CEOs of the Cycle to Work Scheme for 2011 and subsequent years. The scheme will apply to all staff employed by VECs.Legislation was introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 which allows an employer to incur the expense of providing an employee with a new bicycle1 without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation.  The legislation also permits the benefit-in-kind tax exemption to apply in the context of salary sacrifice, that is, where an employee agreed to forego or sacrifice part of his/her salary in lieu of the provision of new bicycle by the employer. The employee will not pay tax, PRSI, income levy or pension related deduction on the remuneration sacrificed.The scheme allows an employer to purchase a new bicycle and/or bicycle safety equipment up to a value of €1,000 once every 5 years on behalf of an employee.A guidance note on the scheme including a series of Questions and Answers provided by the Revenue Commissioners can be found at:

http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/bik-exemption-for-bicycles.pdf

The scheme applies only to new bicycles and bicycle safety equipment purchased from approved suppliers. [A list of suppliers is available on the OPW web site at:

The alteration must not be retrospective and must be evidenced in writing.3. There must be no entitlement to exchange the benefit for cash;4. The choice exercised (i.e. benefit instead of cash) cannot be made more frequently than once in a five-year period5. The choice exercised must be irrevocable for the relevant year for which it is made.The salary sacrifice will have no impact on pension contributions or on pension benefits.

EN14781:2006 — racing bicycles.More information on these matters can be accessed at http://www.nsai.ie5. The employee will not be able to cease his or her participation in the scheme prior to the expiry of the salary sacrifice arrangement, except in cases of termination of employment. Where employment is terminated before the expiration of the salary sacrifice arrangement, the employee must pay the balance due to the Department of Education and Skills, which may be deducted from any outstanding payment due in termination of the employment. Where this is not possible, it may be then necessary for the Department of Education and Skills to recover the balance due from the employee under the terms of Circular: Pay 045/2010: Policy and Procedures for dealing with Overpayment of Salary/Allowances.6. Participation in the scheme is limited to once in each five year period. Accordingly any person who availed of the scheme in 2010 under the terms of Circular 54/2009 cannot re-apply in 2011.7. The scheme applies only to new bicycle/cycle safety equipment purchased from approved providers. A full list of providers is available from the OPW website:http://www.opw.ie/en/OurBusinessUnits/GovernmentSuppliesAgency/Cycle-to-WorkScheme/.8. The payment for the bicycle/cycle safety equipment will be made to the supplier by the Department. It will be a requirement of the scheme for participating suppliers that all warranties relating to the bicycle/bicycle safety equipment will be for the benefit of the employee and all issues arising in relation to the warranties will remain between the employee and the supplier.9. The processing of applications will only commence after the closing date for each application option At the time of purchasing the bicycle or safety equipment the supplier should be advised that payment will only issue subsequent to the  closing date.10. The employee acknowledges that the Department of Education and Skills is not responsible or liable for the security, disposal, maintenance, repair and use of the bicycle or bicycle safety equipment.11. The Department of Education and Skills accepts no responsibility for misuse of bicycles or equipment by the employees and asserts that bicycles and bicycle safety equipment acquired by virtue of the scheme are strictly non transferable.

The Council of  Europe offers member States assistance in carrying out analyses of their  language education policies with the assistance of a team of international  experts. The Profile was published in 2007. It recommended that Ireland should  develop a national languages strategy. Its remit would cover such areas as: the  place and role of languages in society; possible scenarios for the integration  of languages in the education system and the implications for curriculum  development, teacher education etc.; language provision at second level;  structures or measures to provide ongoing advice on language policy.A Working Group has developed a draft languages policy for internal submission to the Department preparatory to a wider consultation phase.

Teacher Recruitment

Registration and Qualifications
The Minister for Education and Skills, in accordance with the authority conferred by section 24 of the Education Act 1998, directs that school authorities, as employers, ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to teaching posts for which salary grant is being sought must be:
1. Registered with the Teaching Council in accordance with Section 31 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001

And

2. Have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which s/he is proposed
The following exceptions will apply:a) Where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified and/or unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher and this provision must be inserted in the employment contract. The employer shall repeat the process to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of any such contract and in any event within the school year. The person recruited will be remunerated at the unqualified rate.b) In the case of an appointee who has applied to the Teaching Council, remuneration will be at the rate for unqualified persons pending the decision of the Council. This provision must be inserted in the employment contract. When registration for the sector and recognition of qualifications for the purpose of the post is achieved then incremental salary will be allowed from the date of registration. Otherwise the employer shall repeat the recruitment process within the school year.
Special Schools
The position remains that special schools must recruit teachers qualified to teach in primary schools except in the case of special schools that cater for pupils of post-primary age where it is sanctioned by this Department as being appropriate to appoint teachers with other qualifications.
Conditional Registration
A teacher conditionally registered with the Teaching Council will be remunerated on the teachers incremental salary scale. This is conditional on continued compliance with the terms of registration within the period prescribed by the Teaching Council and this condition must be inserted in the employment contract. In the event that conditional registration lapses then from that date, remuneration will be at the rate for unqualified persons and the employer shall repeat the recruitment process within the school year.
Application
The terms of this circular are applicable to all new appointments from 1st September, 2010.This circular supersedes all previous circulars, memoranda, rules and regulations in relation to this area including Circular 24/00.Matters relating to registration of teachers are appropriate to the Teaching Council, Block A, Maynooth Business Campus, Maynooth, Co.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	961	Strands 1 and 2 (1 — Statistics and Probability and 2 — Geometry & Trigonometry) of the Project Maths syllabus are being implemented in 1st and 5th year in post-primary schools from this September.  In advance of the implementation of these Strands, two full day workshops were offered to all post-primary teachers of mathematics in the school year 2009/2010.  Over 4,700 teachers received in-service for Strand 1 with extra workshops having being run for teachers who were unable to attend the original round of Strand 1 workshops.  For Strand 2, over 4,400 teachers have received in-service.  In the 2010/11 school year a further 2 days in-service will be offered.  Invitations have issued for teachers to attend Workshop 3 on Strand 3 — Number & Problem Solving, which is commencing this week.  Further Workshops will be rolled out as further Strands of the syllabus are implemented, and it is envisaged that the programme of support will continue until at least 2013.Other facets of the professional development programme will also continue to be developed.  These include evening courses in ICT for the teaching of mathematics and in relation to areas of syllabus content.The Project Maths Development Team continues to develop its services and provides a wide range of resources which aim to support teachers and students in the teaching and learning of mathematics.  The team, in conjunction with  Department officials and industry representatives, will shortly be examining ways to progress some of the recommendations made in the Report of the Project  Maths Implementation Support Group (published in June 2009).
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	962	Project Maths began in all second level schools from September 2010.  The Project Maths initiative is designed to encourage better understanding of Maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle.  A key objective is to improve attainment levels in maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.The initiative started in 2008 in 24 schools, and the experience in the project schools is informing the national mainstreaming of the initiative.  A national programme of professional development for all teachers began in 2009, and will continue to at least 2013.The NCCA website www.ncca.ie. sets out the draft syllabus for Strands 1, 2, 3 and 4 at junior and senior cycle, a draft common Mathematics course for the first year in junior cycle, and a Geometry course.  The website www.ProjectMaths.ie sets out additional supports in the form of teaching and learning plans, a forum for teachers, and additional resources.  These resources will expand over time.  Overall, the changes will be implemented in 5 strands of mathematics over a 3  year period.Project Maths is being supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers, with some €5m being invested in this area in 2010.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	963	In July 2009 my predecessor gave notice that, with effect from the start of the 2010/11 academic year, a number of changes to the student grant schemes would be introduced.  These included:Some social welfare allowances, including the Back to Education Allowance which had been excluded in the means-testing process, will be included as reckonable income in assessing eligibility for student grants;The income tax adjustment for farm stock relief will be disregarded in calculating reckonable income for means-testing purposes;The residency requirement in the State for grant eligibility will be increased from one year to three out of the past five years for the student — a move that's in line with provisions already outlined in the Student Support Bill;The duration of the break in studies required for re-entry as an independently assessed mature student will be increased from one year to three years.In addition, from September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance for all schemes and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met, for eligible students, by the Exchequer on their behalf.  They should apply to their assessing authority to have their eligibility assessed.Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course, provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the scheme.  Students progressing to a new course, with effect from 2010/11, will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.These changes are applicable to all students, including postgraduate students. Students should apply to their local authority or VEC to establish their eligibility.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	966	As the Deputy will be aware, applications were invited under the Summer Works Scheme 2010 for specified water conservation measures. In excess of 1,800 applications were received.I hope to announce details of the successful applicants later this year.The specific water conservation measures were: urinal controls; cistern displacement devices; variable flushing devices; push type percussion spray taps and thermostatic mixing valves.  Rain water harvesting was not a category under the Summer Works Scheme in 2010.  Therefore, applications for funding for rainwater harvesting facilities were not approved.Rainwater harvesting systems were first introduced for major school building projects in 2008.  Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through installing push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc.

The application  has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for  large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.5 rating.There are four band ratings under the prioritisation criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents  explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's  website.Information in respect of the current school building programme along with assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred  to by the Deputy, are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design through to construction phase will be considered in the  context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation  Programme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	981	The most recent projections used by my Department would see the projected enrolments at post-primary level increase from the current total enrolment (excluding PLCs) of circa 312,200 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 328,700  pupils by the year 2016. Meeting this level of significant increased demand for  education services will be a major challenge.It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the  level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post  primary level up to 2017.   Overall post-primary requirements in the area in  Co. Louth referred to by the Deputy, including the case for the provision of a  new second level all Irish language school will be considered in this context.In addition to this I have recently announced the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their  patronage, whereby an expert Group to be known as the Second-Level Patronage  Advisory Group will consider applications for new schools and advise me in  relation to those applications, having undertaken survey work of parental views  and using the criteria to be set down.The progression of all large scale building projects arising from Forward Planning Section's analysis will be considered in the context of my  Department's School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	982	I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 380 together.A detailed follow up to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 89 and 90 of 11 March 2010, is currently being finalised and it will be issued shortly to the Deputy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	983	As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a  permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public  sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the  Exchequer.  In the higher education sector, the Government agreed that an  employment control framework (ECF) be put in place to provide for the  application of the moratorium arrangements in the sector, subject to the  continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the  Department of Finance.  The ECF aims to provide institutions with a greater  flexibility around recruitment in the filling of posts, on the basis of meeting  a required overall reduction in posts.  All such institutions have confirmed to  the HEA that the targeted reductions in staff numbers to end December 2010 will  be achieved.It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, including the institution referred to by the Deputy, to manage their staffing resources in  the context of implementing the framework.  In this regard, my Department and  the HEA are aware of a specific operational issue in the institution, referred  to by the Deputy, relating to the decision by the Board in the University to  promote a number of academic staff.  The University concerned has indicated  that the promotions are in title only for the duration of the current  Employment Control Framework. This decision apparently was made in the context  of recommendations from an internal promotions process that commenced in  November 2008 before the moratorium was implemented in April 2009.The HEA has written to the University concerned  to notify them that these appointments amounted to a breach of the terms of the current ECF, to request  the withdrawal of the award of these promotions until further notice and to  notify them that if this was not possible due to contractual or other issues,  the imposition of appropriate penalties would be considered further.  A  response from the university concerned will be considered at a forthcoming  meeting of the Employment Control Framework Monitoring Committee which consists  of representatives of the HEA, the Department  of Education and Skills and the  Department of Finance.  I understand from the HEA that they are not aware of  any other academic promotions of this nature that have been made under the  moratorium/ECF.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	985	The Deputy will be aware of my Department's commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with special needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.Children with special educational needs, including the specific conditions mentioned by the Deputy, have a range of placement options available to them.  Many pupils with special needs, including those mentioned by the Deputy, attend mainstream schools alongside their peers. Depending on the extent of their special educational need, these pupils may receive support from the school's Learning Support teacher and/or additional tuition hours provided by a Resource teacher.  In addition, schools with pupils enrolled who have significant care needs, can apply for additional support through the Special Needs Assistant scheme.Other pupils with special educational needs attend a special class attached to a mainstream school while some pupils attend a special school. These pupils are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios and, where necessary, special needs assistants.  The Deputy will be aware that the expansion in the network of autism-specific special classes in schools has been a key priority in recent years. My Department also funds assistive technology and/or specialist equipment and special school transport arrangements for pupils with special educational needs.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating supports to schools to support children with special educational needs. Schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs that are eligible for such support, apply to the NCSE for the allocation of the necessary resources.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	986	As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the undertaking within the Renewed Programme for Government to an overall expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210, currently NEPS staffing numbers stand at 157. While 11 new recruits have been brought into the NEPS service in the past year a similar number have been lost to the service in that time due to resignation or retirement.However I can inform the Deputy that my Department and the Public Appointments Service (PAS), following the organisation of a competition and interview process earlier this year, has put in place a new recruitment panel for NEPS.  PAS is currently poling candidates for an initial intake of 20 psychologists which it is hoped will, following the required Garda vetting process, be available for intake into NEPS by years end or early in the new year.  It is also envisaged that the remainder of the required intake, to the level of that committed to in the Renewed Programme for Government, will receive similar offers shortly thereafter.This targeted expansion will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to all primary and post-primary schools and pupils nationally.

In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department for the current school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009. While the staffing schedule allocates on the basis of an average number of pupils each individual school decides on how to arrange its classes.Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the foreseeable future. The Deputy will be aware that the renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government and also the provision of 500 additional teaching posts between primary and second levels over a three year period.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	988	The overall policy goal of my Department is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.  This temporary accommodation is suitable for use as classroom accommodation.  It is important, when additional teacher posts are sanctioned by my Department, that schools are facilitated to appoint and accommodate them as soon as possible.The policy of my Department on utilising temporary or prefabricated structures to accommodate students depends on a number of factors including:Whether the school has permanent recognition or is provisionally recognised.  Many schools, when first established, are given provisional recognition and only obtain permanent recognition when they have proved that they are viable.If the need is deemed short term, the policy is generally to approve temporary rental of accommodation. For example, a school may require a temporary building while it is awaiting the completion of construction of a permanent building.Immediacy of requirement. In some cases, a school needs accommodation at very short notice and this can only be provided through temporary or prefabricated accommodation, due to the length of time required to design, obtain statutory approvals and construct a permanent structure.As the Deputy may be aware, where a need for additional accommodation is likely to exist for three years or more, it is my Department's practice to offer schools grant aid which can be used to construct a permanent structure, rather than using the grant aid to purchase or rent temporary accommodation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	989	In general, my Department approves the purchase or rental of prefabricated classrooms based on need at the time of application. My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who currently occupy temporary accommodation, this depends on the organisation of class groups by the school management within available accommodation and may vary from year to year.A change in policy that has been implemented by my Department is to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than 3 years. Furthermore, since July 2008, it is also policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab. These policies are reducing the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs.In addition, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money. The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	990	I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 to 391, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The NCSE is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools. Additional teaching and SNA supports are allocated as necessary by the NCSE in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs.  Schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs that are eligible for such support, apply to the NCSE for the allocation of the necessary resources. The NCSE has outlined the processes involved in the consideration of applications for special needs supports in its Circular 01/05 which is available on www.ncse.ie.Such resources are allocated by the NCSE, in accordance with my Departments policy, on a demand driven basis.  Therefore, schools which have enrolled students who qualify for additional special educational support are not denied such resources due to any overall budgetary or staffing number ceiling.  In addition to resource teaching support, each school has access to learning support.  My Department does not retain information on the numbers of children who require learning support, resource or special needs teaching. There are currently over 9,000 resource and learning support teachers employed in mainstream schools, over 500 teachers in special classes and over 1,100 special school teachers.In total there are over 20,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs, including approximately 10,000 Special Needs Assistants — compared with just 300 in 1997.This commitment reflects my Departments policy in relation to providing for a continuum of educational provision that promotes the maximum level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, within their locality, or where necessary to support students in special classes or schools. As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, assistive technology and specialist equipment.I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years, which has seen a huge increase in resources for pupil's with special educational needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers. Along with all other areas of expenditure, provision is dependent on the resources available to the Government.

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection and with reference to recent schools' enrolment data.School accommodation requirements in the Midleton/Carrigtwohill area have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified areas, which indicates that in the range of 38 additional primary classrooms may be required across that area to cater for increased enrolments up to the school year 2014/15.My Department is considering options to meet the deficit identified.  As part of this approach, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department is engaged in the process of acquiring a site subject to planning for a proposed educational campus of two 16-classroom schools.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	999	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on the introduction of vehicle registration tax (VRT) on 1 January 1993, there was a requirement for all vehicles to be presented for examination prior to registration.  However, by the early years of this decade, the Revenue Commissioners had adopted a risk-based approach to the registration of vehicles, thus eliminating the need for all vehicles, save those that posed a serious risk of loss to the Exchequer, to be examined prior to registration.  While this risk-based approach proved satisfactory to protect the VRT yield, it meant that a significant number of the used vehicles entering the State were being registered in the State without prior examination.The Deputy will be aware that Revenue, as the registration authority for the State, also has a responsibility to ensure that all vehicles presented for registration are registered correctly.  This responsibility became more onerous with the transposition into Irish law in March 2009 of EU Directive 2007/46/EC, which laid down minimum European vehicle standards as a pre-condition for registration.  While the Directive impacts only on new passenger cars at present, its scope will be extended to all vehicles by 2014.  Additionally, other EU Directives will extend obligations on the registration authorities of all Member States to examine all vehicles prior to registration.In addition to the EU vehicle inspection requirements mentioned above, concerns were raised by members of the Oireachtas and stakeholders in the National Fleet Management Group (namely, An Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Transport and the Revenue Commissioners) regarding the provenance and safety of some of the used vehicles presented for registration.Taking the above factors into account, and bearing in mind that examination of vehicles is by no means the optimum use of the Revenue Commissioners' scarce resources whose core work is the assessment and collection of taxes and duties, the Government decided to make legislative provision to allow for the appointment of a competent person to carry out a pre-registration examination on all vehicles presented for registration.  The intention of the relevant law is to ensure that all the conditions necessary for the registration of a vehicle and the proper administration of VRT are complied with before a vehicle may be registered in the State.Thus, section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by section 104 of the Finance Act 2010) provided for the appointment of a "competent person” to carry out certain functions relating to the registration of vehicles in the State on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, while section 109 of the Finance Act 2010 provided for the authorisation of such competent person in respect of the collection and payment of the tax to the Revenue Commissioners.Following a competitive procurement process carried out during 2008, in accordance with the public sector procurement rules, Applus Car Testing Limited (who also have responsibility for the operation of the National Car Testing Service (NCTS)) were appointed and authorised to carry out specified registration functions in relation to the operation of VRT and have been performing those functions in the State since 1 September 2010.The requirement to present personal identification at an NCTS centre when registering a vehicle ensures that the person presenting a vehicle for registration is accountable for the vehicle.  It also ensures that the registration and ownership details for the register of the national fleet of vehicles are as accurate as possible at the time of first registration in the State.  It should be noted that a clause regarding taxpayer confidentiality was included in the letter of appointment issued by the Revenue Commissioners to Applus Car Testing Limited.  Accordingly, details relating to taxpayers held by that company may not be used for any purpose other than one relating to the registration of vehicles.

The availability of tax relief at 33% to all taxpayers regardless of their marginal rate would result in a reduction in the tax relief on pension contributions available to higher rate taxpayers and an additional incentive to pension savings for standard rate taxpayers.In the revised Programme for Government, the Government has committed to the introduction of a new pension savings incentive will be set at a rate equivalent to 33% tax relief rather than the existing marginal rate relief. This commitment is also included in the National Pensions Framework. The Framework also makes clear that PRSI and Health Levy relief on pension contributions will be in addition to the 33% rate of tax relief and the mechanism for delivering this relief will be developed during the implementation phase of the Framework.

This is a major project in nature and scale, all the more so given that such a nationwide exercise has not been undertaken since the mid-1800's.The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Valuation Act 2001, which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed last year and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will be completed this year (2010). In the next phase, it is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas in the coming months and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway in Dublin City and in the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.The Commissioner is confident that the national revaluation programme can be delivered in a ten-year period, which accords with relevant provisions of the Act, but is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for delivery within a shorter timeframe.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1003	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on the introduction of vehicle registration tax (VRT) on 1 January 1993, there was a requirement for all vehicles to be presented for examination prior to registration.  However, by the early years of this decade, the Revenue Commissioners had adopted a risk-based approach to the registration of vehicles, thus eliminating the need for all vehicles, save those that posed a serious risk of loss to the Exchequer, to be examined prior to registration.  While this risk-based approach proved satisfactory to protect the VRT yield, it meant that a significant number of the used vehicles entering the State were being registered in the State without prior examination.The Deputy will be aware that Revenue, as the registration authority for the State, also has a responsibility to ensure that all vehicles presented for registration are registered correctly.  This responsibility became more onerous with the transposition into Irish law in March 2009 of EU Directive 2007/46/EC, which laid down minimum European vehicle standards as a pre-condition for registration.  While the Directive impacts only on new passenger cars at present, its scope will be extended to all vehicles by 2014.  Additionally, other EU Directives will extend obligations on the registration authorities of all Member States to examine all vehicles prior to registration.In addition to the EU vehicle inspection requirements mentioned above, concerns were raised by members of the Oireachtas and stakeholders in the National Fleet Management Group (namely, An Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage & Local Government, the Department of Transport and the Revenue Commissioners) regarding the provenance and safety of some of the used vehicles presented for registration.Taking the above factors into account, and bearing in mind that examination of vehicles is by no means the optimum use of the Revenue Commissioners' scarce resources whose core work is the assessment and collection of taxes and duties, the Government decided to make legislative provision to allow for the appointment of a competent person to carry out a pre-registration examination on all vehicles presented for registration.  The intention of the relevant law is to ensure that all the conditions necessary for the registration of a vehicle and the proper administration of VRT are complied with before a vehicle may be registered in the State.Thus, section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by section 104 of the Finance Act 2010) provided for the appointment of a "competent person” to carry out certain functions relating to the registration of vehicles in the State on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, while section 109 of the Finance Act 2010 provided for the authorisation of such competent person in respect of the collection and payment of the tax to the Revenue Commissioners.Following a competitive procurement process carried out during 2008, in accordance with the public sector procurement rules, Applus Car Testing Limited (who also have responsibility for the operation of the National Car Testing Service (NCTS)) were appointed and authorised to carry out specified registration functions in relation to the operation of VRT and have been performing those functions in the State since 1 September 2010.With regard to the acquisition of open market selling prices of vehicles prior to registration, the VRT calculator facility on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie  currently provides an estimate of VRT liability for over 20,000 vehicle models and allows the vast majority of users to ascertain an estimated vehicle valuation and VRT liability prior to registration. However, due to the larger and more varied supply of vehicle models available in the UK (where most used vehicles acquired outside the State are sourced), it is not possible for Revenue to have a valuation for all models with different specifications that have not been previously registered in the State. Revenue is obliged to focus its resources on areas of greatest risk and is unable, currently, to allocate resources to conduct research and to provide a telephone consultancy for all vehicle models prior to registration particularly as the vast majority of such requests in the past, have proven speculative in nature.It should be noted in the limited number of instances where Revenue are not in a position to provide a vehicle valuation on the VRT calculator prior to registration, persons can consult with the numerous professional car valuations services that are currently available. In this regard, car sales guides, car sales websites and vehicle dealerships in the State and in other jurisdictions represent a reliable source of information based on current values of vehicles.Finally, all vehicle valuations whether sourced through the Revenue VRT Calculator or by other means are subject to the presentation of the vehicle at a NCTS centre, where the final valuation and VRT liability specific to the particular model will be confirmed by Revenue at the time of registration.The Deputy will appreciate that an internet-based valuation system provides an efficient, fast and user-friendly facility which is accessible to a large proportion of the population of the State (either directly or indirectly).Revenue have also confirmed that an enhanced VRT Calculator facility will be available from the end of November 2010.

Finalisation of Revenue audits includes the calculation of tax, interest and penalties, in accordance with criteria set out in the Code.The Code of Practice for Revenue Auditors also outlines the factors generally considered before a decision to investigate a case with a view to prosecution is taken.Finally the Commissioners have advised me that following a period of consultation with tax practitioners, a revised edition of the Code has been finalised and recently been published on www.revenue.ie shortly.

This is an important support to the Irish banking system, facilitating its access to both short and longer term funding to help maintain the overall stability of the banking sector and complements the broad Government Strategy to restore fully the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.With regard to the situation beyond end 2010, my Department and the relevant state authorities along with the EU Commission will continue to monitor market developments over the coming months so as to confirm that the Guarantee continues to underpin the core principles of financial stability and funding access for the financial institutions. Approval for the continued provision of financial support under this Scheme must be sought from the European Commission every six months in accordance with EU State aid requirements.

Given the current band structures, major issues would need to be resolved as to how, in practice, such a new rate could be integrated into the current system and how this would affect the relative position of different types of income earners.This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.

This estimate assumes no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers.CGT is very dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield. In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution. The realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy. In addition, increasing the rate could, in theory, lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.

In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.

If relief for these deductions and reliefs was confined to the standard rate of income tax the saving to the Exchequer could be of the order of €1,100 million.This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a change or the economic effect of such a change.

Based on an estimate of around €150 million of bets having been placed with on-course bookmakers at race meetings over the twelve month period to September 2010, it is estimated that applying the 5% betting duty to such bets would have yielded the Exchequer approximately €7.5 million.The on-course duty was reduced from 5% to zero in 1999 in the context of the reduction in the off-course duty at that time and the importance of supporting attendances at race meetings.

If a cap of €120,000 was imposed on both a Minister and Minister of State's salary the savings in a full year on the Office Holder's element only would be €0.9m.Section 2 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009 provides, inter alia, that long service increments will not be paid to any member of the Houses of the Oireachtas after the next general election. This would reduce the estimated annual savings arising from a similar capping of the salaries of TDs and Senators to €2.1m and €0.3m respectively based on full membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas.

The yield includes the effect of increasing the standard rate for manufacturing companies from 12.5% to 13.5%, with the termination of the 10% rate of Corporation Tax for these companies with effect from 31st December 2010.This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such an increase.However, it should also be noted that Ireland's low Corporation Tax (CT) rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland thereby increasing employment here. We also must consider Ireland's place in the new enlarged EU where CT rates are low in some new member states.  Ireland must continue to remain competitive in this environment. For these reasons there are no plans to increase our present low CT rate.

Moneylenders are required to assist consumers to understand the products on offer.  They must provide the following information to their clients: * the method of repayment of the loan, and * details of all fees, related interest payments, charges and the cost per 100 euros borrowed.They must also indicate prominently the high-cost nature of the loan on all loan documentation where the APR is 23% or higher. This disclosure must take the following form: ‘ Warning: This is a high-cost loan’
These requirements are set out in the Financial Regulator's ‘Consumer  Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders’.  This Code came into full effect on 30 September 2009.I should add that one of the conclusions of the report on the ‘Licensed Moneylending Industry', published by the Financial Regulator in March 2007, was that the introduction of an interest ceiling for moneylenders may not achieve the objectives of lowering the cost of credit for consumers.I would encourage consumers to shop around and consider all the different sources of loans that are available to them.  I would also encourage them to avail of the personal finance information that is available from the National Consumer Agency.  This information can be found on the website www.itsyourmoney.ie.  In addition, to the information provided on this website, people who are in debt or in danger of getting into debt may avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS). MABS works with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future. It is a national, free, confidential and independent service.

This policy is fully aligned and is developing in tandem with market and regulatory developments at EU level, including the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the introduction of the Payment Services Directive from November 2009 and the introduction of the revised Electronic Money Directive from April 2011.  In promoting this policy objective, the Government has reduced stamp duty on combined ATM cards from €10 to €5 in Budget 2009, building upon changes in the previous year's Budget. Stamp duty on cheques was also increased from 30 cent to 50 cent per cheque, to act as a further disincentive to cheque usage.I indicated the need to establish new governance arrangements to further promote the development of electronic payments in our economy in Budget 2009.  As part of this process, the National Payments Implementation Programme Advisory Group provided recommendations in a report submitted to me in July 2009 on the possible mechanisms and mandate to further promote the development of electronic payments.The report presents a clear analysis of the current situation in Ireland concerning the use of different payments instruments.  Part of the report addresses the continuing problem of the non-participation of a sizeable portion of the population in mainstream financial services.  It found that approximately 10% of people still do not have access to an account that can make or receive payments and this situation has to be addressed to support financial inclusion.  The report therefore recommends that a key part of a new National Payments Plan should be the implementation of a specific strategy to deal with all those who currently do not have any facility to make and receive electronic payments.  I agree with this conclusion of the report.By way of updating the Deputy on progress on the report of the National Payments Implementation Programme Advisory Group, there are ongoing discussions within my Department and with external stakeholders such as the Irish Payment Services Organisation (IPSO) on how the recommendations of the report can be successfully brought to fruition.  Following the conclusion of these discussions, I would intend to bring proposals to Government on the priorities for a new national payments plan.  At that point, I would also propose to publish the report.In addition, discussions between my Department and the European Commission on a package of horizontal or sector measures to support the maintenance of competition in the banking market in Ireland will also impact on how this recommendation of the report will be implemented.  One of the commitments agreed with the European Commission as part of the bank restructuring process is that the domestic banking sector will be required to support and promote the availability of a basic bank account.

The Commission is solely responsible for the control, management and investment of the assets of the Fund (other than assets which the Minister for Finance has directed the Commission to invest in a listed credit institution under the provisions of the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009) and for determining the investment strategy for the Fund in accordance with Fund investment policy.  The Commission is required to invest the assets of the Fund so as to secure the optimal total financial return, having regard to the purpose of the Fund and the eventual requirements on the Fund to make payments to the Exchequer, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission.As set out in its Annual Report 2009, the NPRF Commission has made some changes to its strategic asset allocation following a scheduled review of its long-term investment strategy during the second half of 2009 and in early 2010. The Commission's revised asset allocation strategy remains focused on investment in real assets and on maximising return within acceptable risk levels over the long term. The revised strategic asset allocation includes a 5% allocation to absolute return investments.  Such investments seek an absolute return in all market conditions rather than seeking to outperform a market index.  In general, absolute return funds seek to insulate themselves from market movements and, for example, to profit from mispricings of securities or asset classes.  The attraction of absolute return funds is that, by allowing the Fund to diversify away from equity and credit market movements, they are expected to reduce the Fund's overall volatility.  The Commission's first new investments in this absolute return investments are expected to consist of a small number of funds of hedge funds.I understand that the NPRF Commission has appointed Aksia, a New York-based fund of hedge funds consultant, to provide consultancy services for the selection of a portfolio of funds of hedge funds.

However, the table below, which is extracted from the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume, published in February 2010, sets out the "functional classification" of Gross Current Voted Expenditure as a proportion of Gross National Product (which is a more appropriate indicator than Gross Domestic Product in Ireland's case) for each of the years 2006 to 2010.  The table shows that expenditure on "Social Services" category — mainly Social Welfare, Health and Education — has increased from 22.1% of GNP in 2006 to an estimated 35% of GNP in 2010.My Department does not maintain statistics on other EU countries, but I would direct the Deputy to the website of Eurostat, the EU statistics agency at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat, which provides access to a large amount of EU wide information in this area.Functional Classification20062007200820092010Economic ServicesIndustry and Labour (including NTF expenditure)0.9%0.9%1.0%1.1%1.2%Agriculture0.9%0.8%0.9%1.1%1.0%Fisheries and Forestry0.0%0.0%0.1%0.1%0.1%Tourism0.1%0.1%0.1%0.2%0.2%Subtotal1.9%1.9%2.1%2.4%2.5%Social ServicesHealth8.2%8.9%9.9%11.4%11.4%Education4.8%4.9%5.5%6.4%6.3%Social Welfare (including SIF expenditure)8.9%9.6%11.5%15.6%16.3%Housing0.1%0.1%0.1%0.2%0.3%Subsidies0.2%0.2%0.2%0.2%0.2%Subtotal22.1%23.7%27.3%33.9%35.0%SecurityDefence0.6%0.6%0.7%0.8%0.7%Garda0.8%0.9%1.0%1.2%1.1%Prisons0.2%0.2%0.3%0.3%0.3%Legal, etc.0.4%0.4%0.5%0.4%0.4%Subtotal2.0%2.2%2.4%2.6%2.5%Other2.4%2.4%2.7%2.9%2.8%Gross Current Expenditure on Services28.4%30.1%34.5%41.8%42.4%

It is estimated that an increase in the general, non-aged, income levy threshold from €15,028 per annum to €18,304 per annum would cost in the region of €55 million in a full year.This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011.  It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.A Pre-Budget 2011 Income Tax Ready Reckoner is now available on my Department's website, www.finance.gov.ie.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1028	All taxes and potential taxation measures are constantly reviewed in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill.Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are levied on an individual or company on the disposal of an asset (CGT) or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance (CAT).  However, they are not annual taxes on an individual's wealth, which is presumably what the Deputy has in mind.  The rate of both of these taxes was increased to 25% in Supplementary Budget 2009.The Deputy will be aware that I announced the introduction of a Domicile Levy in Budget 2010, the legislative provisions for which were contained in Finance Act 2010.  The Levy is charged on an individual who is Irish-domiciled and an Irish citizen whose world-wide income exceeds €1m, whose Irish-located property is greater than €5m, and whose liability to Irish income tax was less than €200,000.  The Levy applies for the tax year 2010 and is payable on a self-assessment basis on or before 31st October in the year, following the valuation date which is 31st December of each year.  The amount of the levy is €200,000.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as they have no statistical basis for compiling estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax, it is therefore not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.

Anglo Irish Bank
The Annual Report and accounts for the 15 months ended 31 December 2009 was received in the Department of Finance on 31 March 2010.  The Annual Report and Accounts the year ended 30 September 2008 was received in the Department on 19 February 2009.  The Department does not approve the Annual Report of the Bank.  The Bank was nationalised on 15 January 2009.
National Lottery
The Annual Report and accounts for 2009 was received by the Department of Finance on 5 May 2010 and presented by me as Minister for Finance to Government on 7 May 2010.  The Annual Report and Accounts for 2008 were received by the Department of Finance on 6 March 2009 and presented to Government on 23 March 2009.

Funding was allocated on the basis of an assessment of the applications submitted by the Council as regards the eligibility criteria of the scheme.  The commencement and progression of the works in each case will be a matter for the Council.In addition, Ennis Town Council have been provided with funds totalling €339,402 to date to carry out flood protection works in the Aughanteeroe and Fior Uisce areas of the town.  Progression of the works is a matter for the Council.A major Flood Relief Scheme, managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW), is also underway in Ennis.  Phase One of the scheme (Ennis Upper), with a spend of €5,627,000 to date, is practically complete and tenders for construction of Phase Two (Ennis Lower) are due to be submitted to OPW by mid-October.

Following the transfer of an individual's loans to NAMA, each borrower is requested to complete a realistic and concise business plan.  I am informed by NAMA that this business plan should set out their current situation including their levels of indebtedness to non-NAMA institutions, a full list of assets and liabilities and the borrower's short, medium and long-term objectives.The business plan of each major borrower is assessed by NAMA to assess its viability. Where viability cannot be demonstrated or where a borrower is not co-operating with the process NAMA will take enforcement action against the borrower concerned.The NAMA Board has stated clearly in its recent Business Plan that it will enforce personal guarantees to the greatest extent feasible, that it will secure all unencumbered assets and that it will pursue any assets transferred to third parties.  Where NAMA does engage in any type of enforcement, it will have to go through the courts in the normal way and information on such cases will be in the public domain.  I am informed that NAMA has already commenced proceedings in the Commercial Court in respect of one developer and that further actions can be expected.

These developments are ongoing, more recently with significant capital investment in conference and banqueting facilities and upgrading of the landscape funded by Fáilte Ireland.  This investment recognises the potential Castletown holds both as a museum and as a venue for a range of cultural, state and social activities.In recent time, there has been a significant increase in anti-social behaviour on the estate.  Examples included fires being lit, irreparable damage done to trees, and expensive machinery set on fire.  Native habitats have been destroyed with consequent loss of wildlife.  The anti-social behaviour occurs mainly at night-time.  The impact of these activities, on the protection of the House and Demesne, and the continued development of the property and the amenity value for all visitors, is most worrying.  OPW is very concerned about late-night activities and vandalism to the grounds.  Two recent and very serious incidents may leave the State open for claims.  In the interest of safety and enjoyment of visitors and the protection of the national historic demesne, the OPW is now obliged to review its current policy of allowing local access to the estate outside of normal dawn to dusk hours.With regard to the specific issues, raised in question 463, regarding a boundary fence, I am advised that the Office of Public Works is anxious to have clearly defined, delineated and protected boundaries between privately and publicly owned lands at Castletown Demesne.By and large, Kildare County Council, rather than the Office of Public Works, owns most of the property along a line between the Castletown Demesne and private households.  The OPW encourages the Council and local groups to agree all issues in relation to securing their common boundary and the erection of appropriate fencing.  As a practical gesture and encouragement to these efforts, the OPW has indicated its willingness to contribute towards the cost of erecting an agreed boundary fence.  The Office of Public Works would not interfere with any established rights of way.

However, there are a number of occasions where an exemption from the payment of VRT tax may apply.  One such exemption in respect of VRT and VAT, subject to certain conditions, is provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations. Statutory Instrument No. 353 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (Regulation 12) provides the requirements for Organisations to apply under this Scheme.The named organisation may wish to examine whether it may be eligible under this Scheme.  In that regard, it should contact the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Central Repayments Office, Freepost, M: TEK II Building, Armagh Road, Monaghan (Telephone 047 62100).I have no plans at present to review the current VRT system, which has been in place since 1st July 2008.

We have discussed matters of mutual interest, including NAMA and the significant economic and public finance challenges facing both jurisdictions.The NSMC meets regularly in Plenary and SEUPB Sectoral formats with the next Plenary and the SEUPB Sectoral scheduled for end November/December (dates to be confirmed).In addition, the Government is in regular contact with its British counterparts including the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Irish Government is fully committed to restoring order to the public finances and is actively examining the next phase of its consolidation framework in the context of the ongoing Budget preparations. My Department will publish the Pre-Budget Outlook next month, which will provide an update on the economic and fiscal outlook. Budget 2011 will be presented to the Dáil on Tuesday, 7th December.The Irish Government, of course, remains strongly committed to practical and mutual beneficial North/South cooperation and we continue to explore ways to advance our common interests.

The Statement also indicated that the Central Bank would determine the capital needs of the two institutions and announce its findings by October.  As indicated above the detailed development of this broad outline is underway and it is intended to submit a detailed plan to the EU Commission for approval.Until the detailed plan is further developed the Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to indicate the numbers of staff in each of the proposed banks or specific staff costs at this time.  The staff costs will be determined by the number of staff required for each entity, the necessary skill sets and the appropriate market rates for such skills.

I have no role in the setting or monitoring of bank charges.

No refund was found to be due and a Balancing Statement was issued to this effect on 1 April 2010.An application form for refund of Income Levy was issued to the individual by Limerick Revenue District in June 2010.  This form has not been returned to date.  It is therefore not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to determine that person's current entitlement to such a refund.An application form for a refund of PRSI has also issued to the individual from the Department of Social Protection.When these are returned to the relevant areas they will be processed and any refund due will be forwarded to the taxpayer.If the person in question has any further queries they should contact Mr Enda Malone, Limerick Revenue District, River House, Limerick.

That requirement is a commercial decision for each individual institution.  In deciding on the amount of deposits that they require, I expect the lenders to act responsibly.My role, as Minister for Finance, is to prepare draft legislation for the approval of the Oireachtas to provide an appropriate legislative framework for the regulation of the financial services sector with a particular focus on the consumer.Both the Financial Regulator and the Financial Services Ombudsman play an important role in Consumer Protection.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code (the Code) is applicable to all entities which the Financial Regulator regulates.  Under the General Principles of the Code, all regulated firms are required to:Act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of the customer;Make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer; andSeek to avoid conflicts of interest.In addition, there are provisions in the Code, for the protection of those persons which are classified as ‘consumers' under the Code, which set specific requirements with which the regulated entity must comply in areas such as its terms of business, provision of information to the consumer, knowing the consumer and suitability.Regulated entities are required to comply with the Code and the Financial Regulator will investigate any matter brought to its attention where it appears that these, or any other regulatory requirement, may have been breached by an entity.The Deputy may wish to note that where a consumer has a complaint regarding his/her treatment which has not been resolved through the internal complaint resolutions systems of a regulated entity, the consumer may bring the matter to the attention of the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation.

A total of € 11.434m has been allocated under the scheme in 2010 to date on foot of applications from Local Authorities, most of which relate to locations affected by flooding last winter. Details of the locations and the types of measures involved are given as follows.  A small number of other applications are being considered, and further applications are being received on an ongoing basis.  It is a matter for the Local Authorities to progress the mitigation measures in each case.In addition, the OPW has recently initiated the process of undertaking major flood relief schemes on the Dunkellin and Clare Rivers in County Galway which are estimated to cost €4m and €8m respectively and have initiated a feasibility study at Bandon in County Cork.  This is in addition to a number of major flood relief schemes in progress across the country, where in many cases the initial phase has already been completed with positive benefits.Local AuthorityProject LocationProject Details2010 Funding Allocation€Carlow County CouncilBallymurphy, TullowConstruct berms, retaining walls and drainage works31,500Cavan County CouncilCrosskeys BridgeReplace Bridge72,000Clare County CouncilGort Road Industrial Park, EnnisInstall culvert300,000Ranaghan, RuanFlood mitigation works36,000RuanFlood mitigation works90,000CloonbonyUpgrade Culvert36,000Elm Park / Watery RoadUpgrade embankment and storm drain135,000Cork City CouncilCork City — WallsRepairs and upgrading of quay walls900,000Cork County CouncilSkibbereenStudy120,000ClonakilityChannel capacity improvements350,000The Glen, Glenbrook, Passage WestStudy & remedial works99,000CrookstownInstall flood walls & embankments318,600Donegal County CouncilEastend, BundoranUpgrading pipes27,000Meenaniller, L-1363-2Upgrading of pipes/culvert73,044MeenanillerStudy7,200An Seascann Beag, L-1263Replacement of bridge36,135An Seascann Beag, L-1263Replacement of bridge42,300DerrybegBunding27,000DerrybegBunding31,500Ard na gCeapairi, R257Install culvert29,700CladyknitStudy3,600Burnfoot RiverConstruct embankment, upgrade underground drainage67,500Galway County CouncilAhascraghChannel cleaning45,000BallygluninChannel widening, upgrading culverts60,000Crowe St., GortChannel maintenance and camera survey36,000

For reasons of commercial confidentiality, NAMA is not permitted to disclose information on any of the borrowers whose loans have been acquired from participating institutions. Where property remains in the control of the borrower, the setting of rents is entirely a matter for the borrower and tenant.I would also remind the Deputy that a ban on upward only rent review clauses came into effect on 28 February 2010 under a Ministerial Order signed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1061	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the exact information sought for indirect taxation on a county basis is not available. However, Revenue sheriffs, county registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt within certain geographical boundaries known as a "bailiwick" which equates geographically with "county". Data on the net receipts of some taxes can be linked to bailiwicks to provide an estimated breakdown of receipts on a county basis.This data is available only on the basis of a full calendar year.

They are detailed in the following appendix.In relation to petroleum, there are allowances available for capital expenditure in respect of exploration activities, abandonment and decommissioning of petroleum fields, and production and development of petroleum extraction facilities for the purposes of a petroleum trade.Details of the various allowances available are outlined in the Appendix.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information from Corporation Tax returns is not recorded in such a way as to enable an estimate of the cost of the specific tax reliefs for mining and petroleum exploration companies to be compiled. In any event, it should be borne in mind that any potential cost should be viewed in the context of the overall purpose of these allowances, which taken together are aimed at encouraging economic activity in the mining and petroleum sectors.I should add that profits from a trade of working minerals and profits from a trade in petroleum activities are each subject to Corporation Tax at the higher rate of 25% under section 21A TCA 1997. Provision is also made under section 683 TCA 1997 for a 25% tax charge under Case IV of Schedule D on the net proceeds of the sale of any deposit of scheduled minerals, including land comprising such a deposit.Furthermore, the Finance Act 2008 introduced an additional Profit Resource Rent Tax in respect of any petroleum lease entered into by a petroleum company following on from an exploration licence awarded by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The new tax, which is applicable to petroleum profits which exceed certain defined levels and ranges from 5% to 15%, is in addition to the Corporation Tax rate of 25%.
APPENDIX

Capital Allowances for Mining and Petroleum Exploration

Allowances for mineral exploration expenditure
Under section 673 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, a company may claim an allowance for the amount of exploration expenditure incurred in an accounting period and the allowance may be claimed whether or not a deposit of scheduled minerals is found as a result of the exploration expenditure. The allowance may be offset in full against profits of a mining trade in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred and any unused allowance may be carried forward for offset against future profits of the trade. An exploration company which is not carrying on a trade of working a qualifying mine may, by virtue of section 679, offset exploration expenditure against other profits of the company. A company incurring exploration expenditure may, under section 675, surrender any unused exploration allowances to an associate company within a group thereby enabling the associate company to claim the allowances against its profits from mining activities. Also, section 676 provides that where a company incurs exploration expenditure resulting in a finding of a scheduled mineral deposit and, without having worked the deposit and claimed any exploration allowance, sells the assets to another company, that other company may claim the allowance instead when it commences to work the mineral deposit.Section 677 TCA 1997 provides that a company engaged in petroleum exploration activities may claim an additional investment allowance of 20% of exploration expenditure incurred by it in an accounting period. This means, in effect, that a company can obtain total allowances of 120% of the amount of exploration expenditure incurred.  Unlike the allowance for exploration expenditure under section 673, the 20% investment allowance may not be surrendered to another group company.
Allowance for acquired scheduled mineral deposits
Section 680 TCA 1997 enables a company carrying on a mining trade to obtain a mineral depletion allowance in respect of capital expenditure incurred in acquiring deposits of scheduled minerals or land containing such deposits for the purposes of engaging in a mining trade. The allowance is spread, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated life of the mine subject to a maximum of 20 years. The amount of the allowance is equal to the total capital expenditure incurred in acquiring the deposits less the estimated residual value of the assets at the end of the useful life of the mine.
Allowance for mine development expenditure
Under section 673 TCA 1997, a company carrying on a mining trade can claim an allowance for capital expenditure on the development and construction of a qualifying mine. The allowance may be offset in full against profits of a mining trade in the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred and any unused allowance may be carried forward for offset against future profits of the trade. The amount of the allowance is equal to the total capital expenditure incurred less the estimated residual value of the assets representing that expenditure when the mineral deposits are exhausted.
Allowances for Plant and Machinery
Companies carrying on a mining trade are entitled to the normal wear and tear allowances for plant and machinery under which expenditure is written off on a straight-line basis over 8 years. Also, under section 678 TCA 1997, there is an additional investment allowance available of 20% of expenditure on new plant and machinery (other than certain motor vehicles) acquired for the purposes of a mining trade. The allowance is made for the accounting period in which the expenditure is incurred and means, in effect, that a mining company can obtain total allowances of 120% of expenditure on such new plant and machinery.
Allowance for mine rehabilitation
Section 681 TCA 1997 provides relief for expenditure incurred in connection with the closure of a mine and the rehabilitation of the mine site in accordance with environmental planning requirements. Where such expenditure is incurred after the mine has closed it is treated as incurred on the date of closure so that it is allowable in the final accounting period of trading and, where the allowance generates a terminal loss, the excess allowance may be carried back and offset against trading profits of the previous three years. Alternatively, to facilitate a mining company making advance provision for mine closure costs while working a qualifying mine, an allowance is available for payments made by the company to a mine rehabilitation fund approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Subject to certain conditions, the allowance is computed on the basis of the total amount of scheduled payments spread over the estimated life of the mine.Where any of the allowances referred to above are not used or fully used by a mining company in an accounting period, the unused amount may be carried forward and offset against profits of the company's mining trade in subsequent accounting periods.
Petroleum exploration allowances
Section 693 TCA 1997 provides for a 100% allowance for petroleum exploration expenditure against the profits of a petroleum trade and for recovery of such an allowance by way of a balancing charge where an asset representing such expenditure is realised. Section 694 allows a petroleum exploration company to surrender any unused exploration allowances to an associated company within a group thereby enabling the associate company to claim the allowances instead. This facility is similar to that available for the mining industry.Section 695 provides for a 100% deduction for tax purposes in respect of expenditure in connection with the abandonment and decommissioning of a petroleum field in respect of which a licence has been granted by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The allowance is made for the accounting period in which the company incurred the expenditure. Provision is also made for a 3 year carry back of losses for tax purposes attributable to abandonment expenditure and for the carry forward to a new petroleum trade of any unused allowances for abandonment expenditure incurred in connection with a permanently discontinued trade.There is also provision for an allowance of 100% of capital expenditure on production and development work in connection with a trade of working a relevant petroleum field under a lease granted by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources following on from an exploration licence.Where any of the petroleum allowances referred to above are not used or fully used by a petroleum company in an accounting period, the unused amount may be carried forward and offset against profits of the company's petroleum trade in subsequent accounting periods.

This would include facilities for banking, insurance, grants, loans, credit or financing.Differences in treatment on the grounds of age are permitted in annuities, pensions, insurance policies and other matters relating to risk assessments, but only if the differences are based on actuarial or statistical data or other relevant underwriting or commercial factors and are reasonable, having regard to the data or other relevant factors.A person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on the grounds of age in accessing financial services, contrary to the Equal Status Acts, may seek redress by referring the matter to the Equality Tribunal, at 3 Clonmel Street, Dublin 2. Information, advice and assistance in making a complaint may also be sought from the Equality Authority, through its Public Information Centre, Birchgrove House, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary.

The scheme came into operation in late 2008 for a 3 year period and does not apply to expenditure by private individuals. The accelerated capital allowances scheme is only available to companies.Data on the use of the scheme was requested  from companies in the Corporate Tax return (CT1) for the first time in respect of accounting periods ending in 2009. Statistical data for 2009 is not available as all the returns for that year have not yet been filed and processed. For example, companies with an accounting period ending on 31 December 2009 are not required to submit their CT1 return until end-September 2010. Data will be available some time later after the returns are processed.

The total amount of corporation tax foregone as a result of this scheme is estimated at close on €10.4 million since inception to end 2008, the latest year for which figures are available.

This change would reduce the Stamp Duty payable on higher value properties but would increase it on lower value properties.  It would also mean that first time buyers would pay Stamp Duty.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on the forecast residential Stamp Duty receipts for 2010, there would be a cost to the Exchequer by applying a 2% Stamp Duty rate or a 3% rate to all residential property transfers. In comparison, there would be an additional yield from applying a 3.5% rate.The estimated full year cost of applying a 2% Stamp Duty to all residential property transfers would be €39 million; the full year cost from applying a 3% rate to all such transfers would be €2 million; and the full year additional yield from applying a 3.5% rate to all such transfers would be €16 million.It is noted that this would reduce the Stamp Duty payable on higher value properties but would increase it on lower value properties.  It would also involve first.As Stamp Duty is very dependent on individual behaviour, any change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  Also, in current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution.

The latest full historical data currently available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2007.A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are not required for each individual employee and are aggregated at employer level.There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing  full definitive figures.

There are increases for qualified children.Rent relief for persons over 65 years.  Relief of €4,000 per annum at the standard rate is available for a single person or €8,000 for a married couple or widowed person.An income levy exemption applies for persons aged over 65 years whose aggregate income for the year of assessment is less than €20,000 or €40,000 in the case of a married couple where either is over 65 years.DIRT exemption for persons aged 65 years and over.Where agricultural land is leased by a person aged over 40 years then income up to a limit between €12,000 and €20,000 is exempt from tax.Age-related tax credit (ARTC) in relation to private health insurance premiums.The table below sets out the costs to the Exchequer of the aged-related tax reliefs to the extent that they are available for the years indicated.Tax Relief for Aged Persons over 65Estimated cost to the Exchequer€mAge tax credit34 (2007)Age exemption77 (2011)*Rent relief4.4 (2007)Income levy exemption7.5 (2011)*DIRT exemptionNot availableLeasing of farm land27 (2005)Medical Insurance Premia216 (2009)*Provisional and subject to revision.The costs for 2011 are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.The medical insurance premia tax credit is part of a scheme designed to address the issues covered by the Supreme Court judgment of 2008 that found against the risk equalisation scheme for the provision of private health insurance.The scheme is two-fold, an age-related tax credit to compensate for the higher cost of insurance for older persons, which is funded by a levy on health insurance companies based on the number of people covered by policies underwritten by them. This scheme is a temporary measure for three years from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. It is intended that it will be revenue-neutral over its duration. Part of the cost of contributions to permanent health benefit schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April, 2001.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1075	I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 and 483 together.It is assumed that the levy proposed by the Deputy, would be chargeable on the same income definition to which Income Levy currently applies and on income over €100 and €200 per week, taken to mean €5,200 and €10,400 per annum respectively.  It is also assumed that there are no other exemptions, thresholds or ceilings to reduce the yield.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated yields in respect of the levy proposed by the Deputy on incomes, earned and unearned, over €100 and over €200 per week and at the rates of 4%, 5% and 6% are set out in the table below.Income per weekEstimated Full Year Yield@4%@5%@6%Over €100€2,680m€3,350m€4,025mOver €200€2,240m€2,800m€3,360mThese figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data from the 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011.  They are therefore provisional and are likely to be revised.As regards the application of such a charge to social welfare payments, I have been informed by the Department of Social Protection that without further clarification in relation to the question, it would be difficult to answer accurately.  It is not clear, for example, whether the proposed charge would apply equally to a single individual in receipt of a personal rate social welfare payment or a person claiming and receiving a personal rate of payment and an additional allowance on behalf of a dependent. It is also not clear whether it would apply to secondary payments (e.g. rent supplement or fuel allowance). If the Deputy is willing to clarify the possible application of the levy to social welfare payments directly to the Department of Social Protection, I am informed that it may be possible to provide an answer.

Employers must seek and retain a signed declaration from each employee availing of the exemption to the effect that the bicycle is for his or her own use and will be used for qualifying journeys.There is no threshold on the number of days a bicycle must be used for qualifying journeys and the legislation recognises that there may be private usage in that it only requires that the bicycle must be used "mainly for qualifying journeys".Where an individual has the use of a company car, that individual is chargeable to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 121 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, in respect of the benefit arising, irrespective of whether or not he or she uses the car for travelling to and from work. Once the car is made available to him or her, the income tax charge arises.It is, therefore, possible for a person to be subject to a benefit-in-kind income tax charge in respect of a company car, and also to qualify for the benefit-in-kind exemption for a bicycle under the cycle-to-work scheme.The cycle to work scheme is subject to Revenue audit procedures with the obligation on employers to maintain all relevant records — delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, salary sacrifice agreements between employer and employee, and signed declarations from employees that the bicycle/bicycle safety equipment is for their own use and will be used for travelling to and from work or between work places.The legislation does not differentiate between racing bicycles and other bicycles but there is a limit of €1,000 on the amount of expenditure that may qualify for the exemption. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on where bicycles provided under the scheme can be purchased. In this regard, employers and employees should shop around and satisfy themselves as to the value for money they are obtaining in their purchases. No evidence of retail price increases has been brought to my attention.

Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners do not have statistics on the uptake of the scheme. The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.The purchase of bicycles and associated safety equipment by employers for employees or directors is subject to the normal Revenue audit procedure with the normal obligations on employers to maintain records (e.g. delivery dockets, invoices, payments details, etc.).  The employer is also obliged to keep all salary sacrifice agreements entered into between the employer and employees/directors, together with all signed statements from employees/directors regarding use of the bicycles and safety equipment.It was estimated at the time of the introduction of the scheme that approximately 7,000 employees would avail of it over the first five-year period of its operation at a cost of €0.4 million in a full year. The exemption may apply only once in any five year period in respect of any employee.

These Special Investment Shares give the Minister for Finance effective economic control of EBS.  A Promissory Note to the value of €250 million was issued to EBS in June 2010 to enable it to meet its capital requirements as loans transfer to NAMA.The State has committed to meet the remaining capital requirement, to the extent that private capital is not forthcoming. A range of options in relation to the future of EBS have been considered and arising from this consideration, expressions of interest in the Society were invited and a sale/investment process commenced in June 2010.Interest in the society has since been expressed by a number of parties and proposals have been received.

M1 includes overnight deposits and currency in circulation. M2 is M1 plus longer term deposits up to 2 years maturity or redeemable at notice up to 3 months and Post Office Savings accounts.  M3 is M2 plus repurchase agreements and certain marketable instruments issued by monetary financial institutions (MFIs).Since 1999, the money supply definition has changed to be the Irish contribution to euro area money supply.  The instruments listed above are those deposits placed by or instruments held by Irish and other euro area resident non-monetary financial institutions with MFIs resident in the State.  These data are collected on a harmonised basis across the euro area, and in Ireland are collected from the full population of MFIs.  M4 is not an official measure of money supply in the euro area.  The Central Bank publishes the Irish contribution to euro area money supply on their website, where figures for the period since 2003 can be found.The Central Bank has provided the following information for the period 1997 to 2002:M1a

In that context, records from my Department indicate that this Report was not discussed at the Management Committee of the Department Finance.The Deputy may wish to note that Fitch affirmed Ireland's AAA rating in October 2006.

I assume the figure the Deputy refers to is a reference to the €2.64bn that was forecast in NAMA's draft Business Plan last October.  These were indicative figures and were estimated before conclusion of tendering processes for the various services required by NAMA.  These costs have since been reviewed by the NAMA Board and the estimate provided in the draft Business Plan has been revised to €1.6bn in the most recent Plan published on 30th June 2010.This reduction in costs has been substantial and reflects the very competitive pricing submitted as part of the various tenders. Details in relation to the breakdown of these fees will be published in the NAMA quarterly reports.  I am advised by NAMA that fees payable by NAMA will be approximately €215m for 2011 and are expected to decline significantly as the portfolio reduces.

It allows the HSE to fill vacancies in specific exempted grades in key front line services and to create a limited number of new posts in those exempted grades.  The exempted grades are:Medical consultants;Speech and Language Therapist, Occupational Therapist and Physiotherapist;Clinical Psychologist and Counsellor;Social Worker;Emergency Medical Technician;Psychiatric Nurses;Public Health Nurse and Nurse Sponsorship Scheme;National Cancer Control Programme specialist grades.Provided that it is making satisfactory progress with its employment control framework targets, the HSE also has discretion to fill a limited number of posts on exceptional grounds to support the development of integrated health care and its transformation programme.  There must be suppression of posts of equivalent value in non-frontline areas for each new exempted posts or each exception made.Prior to the Employment Control Framework 2010-2012, the HSE required the specific approval of the Department of Health & Children in the first instance and then my Department to any exceptions.

The moratorium allows for certain general exemptions in the Education and Health Sectors for the filling of certain key posts as well as for the Local Authorities in relation to certain key posts.  Information in relation to the posts covered by these general exemptions may be sought from the relevant Ministers.Departments have been implementing the moratorium in respect of themselves and the bodies under their aegis.  However, where a Department feels that a post should be filled, in either the case of a civil service post or in relation to a public service post in a body under the aegis of the Department, it requires the sanction of the Minister for Finance for an exception to the moratorium.  Requests for exceptions are not made in respect of every vacancy.Each request for an exception is assessed on a case by case basis.  Approval to fill posts is based on the business case made including consideration of, for example:a. statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;b. in a number of instances failure to fill posts could result in a breach of EU/international regulations etc.c. safety related posts where a failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;d. some specialist/technical posts which are required to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers, laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;e. to ensure continuity of essential services.It should be noted that in accordance with the terms of the moratorium, exceptions can only be sought by Government Departments and Offices after all internal possibilities of reassigning staff, reorganising work, etc. have been exhausted.  In addition, as part of the Employment Control Framework 2010-2012 for the Health Sector, the HSE has discretion to fill a limited number of posts on exceptional grounds to support the development of integrated health care and its transformation programme.  There must be suppression of posts of equivalent value in non-frontline areas for each new exempted posts or each exception made.Information on the individual exceptions sought by each Department in respect of Civil Service and Public Service posts is outlined in table 2 and table 3, respectively.  Unless otherwise stated in the tables the information covers the period up to the 1st of September 2010.
Civil Service
Table 2 sets out the breakdown of exceptions to the moratorium which have been sought in respect of the Civil Service.  Approximately 2,800 staff have left the Civil Service since the introduction of the moratorium in March 2009.  To date, exceptions have been sought to fill 1,966 posts and of these 1,244 have been approved either in full or in part. However, only some 520 of these posts will in time involve recruitment of new staff.  During this period the net reduction in civil service numbers has been 2,300, representing a decrease of some 6% on numbers serving numbers in the civil service.  In addition sanction has also been given for some 276 temporary posts for Census 2011 and for various temporary ‘summer relief' type posts.
Public Service
Table 3 sets out the breakdown of exceptions to the moratorium which have been sought in respect of the wider Public Service.  My Department has received 255 requests involving 1,919 posts.  182 requests have been sanctioned in full or in part in respect of 1,014 posts.  27 requests have been refused and a decision is pending in relation to 46 requests.

There are currently 148 mobile phones and mobile devices provided for the use of staff of my Department.Following an EU procurement exercise conducted by my Department, a mobile phone framework agreement was established to provide non-commercial public sector bodies with a simple way to procure mobile voice and data services at competitive rates from a list of qualified vendors.  This framework commenced in February 2008.  My Department ran a competition under the framework for its own mobile voice and data services in May 2008 and re-tendered the service again in March 2010.

In the case in question the person's application for repayment became a valid claim on 24 June 2009 and the refund was made on 7 July 2009 (i.e. within a period of 13 days).  The period within which Revenue must make a refund without incurring an interest charge was reduced from 6 months to 93 days by section 121 of the Finance Act 2007.No data are available on the number of repayment cases where there is no entitlement to interest in circumstances that are similar to this case.

Where an individual has an entitlement to tax relief on interest paid on a qualifying home loan, such relief is generally granted via the TRS system.Following the Budget 2010 changes, only interest payable on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 qualifies for tax relief.  Interest payable on loans taken out prior to that date no longer qualifies for tax relief.  On a practical level, a mortgage account holder notifies Revenue of the details of his or her qualifying home loan.  Revenue determines — having consulted with the relevant lending institution as necessary — the individual's entitlement to tax relief on the interest payable on such loan.  Where matters are in order, Revenue informs the lending institution of the relief to be granted at source in the particular instance.Where the information provided by the individual account holder is accurate and complete, the relief at source is normally effected within a period of eight weeks.  The precise timing in any instance depends on the necessary verification work that Revenue must complete, and the timing of any electronic file exchange between Revenue and the relevant financial institution.  Early partial redemption payments are captured in this exchange and the tax relief at source is adjusted in line with the recalculated interest.The basic structure of the TRS system as set out above has remained largely unchanged since its introduction.  I am informed by Revenue that recent Budget changes as regards the tax relief on interest payable on qualifying home loans have given rise to a need to refine the administrative systems operating in conjunction with the lending institutions.  This is a normal part of the ongoing work that Revenue undertakes with the lenders to minimise the effort on the part of the individual loan account holders to obtain the correct level of tax relief relevant to their particular circumstances.

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) advise that the national debt was €75.2 billion at end-2009 and was €87.2 billion at end-August 2010.Based on the estimated Exchequer Borrowing Requirements for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 contained in Budget 2010, the national debt estimates for end-2010, end-2011 and end-2012 are €94 billion, €112 billion and €127 billion respectively.  These projections are currently being revised by my Department in the context of the publication of the Pre-Budget Outlook in the second half of October.

The existing Garda Station will be demolished in order to facilitate a new entrance and to provide necessary official parking facilities for An Garda Síochána.  This is an essential element to the entire project.

If the taxpayer considers that an adjustment is required he can contact the Revenue Commissioners at 1890 44 44 25.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	The relief to which the Deputy is referring is the owner-occupier relief under the Rural Renewal Scheme.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a person claiming the relief must, among other requirements, be the first owner-occupier of the property in question.  The scheme was not intended to be available to purchasers of properties acquired under tenant purchase arrangements with their local authorities.From the information supplied, the taxpayer initially rented the property in June 2006 from Longford County Council and then subsequently in July 2008 purchased it outright.  However, there appears to be no connection between the initial rent agreement and subsequent purchase agreement, other than the fact that one of the parties was common to both.  On the basis of the relevant legislation, Longford County Council is regarded as the first owner of the property.  Unfortunately, this means that the owner-occupier relief is not available to any subsequent purchaser.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1107	Mortgage Interest Relief for first time and non first time buyers is limited to the first seven tax years for which an individual has entitlement to the relief.  In Budget 2010, I announced that I would be extending the relief up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after.  Those who took out mortgages in 2003 would have seen their entitlement end after 2009 and accordingly, this measure, which was applied on time and as announced, does not apply to these individuals.  While circumstances and house prices differ, it is necessary to select a cut-off point in these matters.The Finance Act 2010 also provides that qualifying loans taken out on or before 31 December 2011 will continue to get relief at current levels.  Qualifying loans taken out in 2012 will receive the relief at a reduced rate of 15% for first-time buyers and 10% for non-first time buyers with ceilings of €6,000 per annum for married couples and €3,000 per annum for single individuals applying in both cases.  Loans taken out on or after 1 January 2013 will not qualify for mortgage interest relief and the relief will be abolished completely for the tax year 2018 and subsequent tax years.As regards Budget 2011, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1109	It is estimated that the additional full year yield, inclusive of VAT, from an increase in the current carbon tax rate (€15 per tonne) of €5, €10, and €15 per tonne would be approximately €110 million, €220 million and €330 million respectively.  The yield in 2011 would of course depend on the timing and phasing of any such increase in the carbon tax.  On the assumption that a €5 per tonne increase was applied from Budget night on all fuel products, the estimated yield in 2011 would be approximately €95 million.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1110	It is presumed the Deputy is referring to the current annual earnings cap of €150,000, which operates to limit the level of tax-relieved personal pension contributions in any one year.  The annual earnings cap acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on pension contributions.The full year yield to the Exchequer arising from reducing the earnings cap to the amount mentioned in the question is currently estimated to be of the order of €85 million.  This figure is provisional and subject to revision. A breakdown of the figures by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of tax payers.With regard to occupational pensions, (that is, schemes set up by the employer), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form. Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels.  For that reason the estimated yield to the Exchequer in respect of these contributions is extremely tentative.  The estimated yield is based on assuming that tax relief which would be affected by the changes mentioned in the question is currently allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and at the maximum age-related percentage limit of earnings.  The figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer yield in respect of those taxpayers.

The yield to the Exchequer from a further similar reduction as mentioned in the question is likely to be of a similar order.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1113	The Terms of Reference of the Independent Review of the Department of Finance, which are set out below, indicate that the focus of the Review will be an evaluation of the systems, structures and processes of the Department of Finance.The Terms of Reference are as follows: "The Independent Review Group will undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the systems, structures and processes of the Department of Finance relating to those elements of budgetary, economic, financial and public service management that are relevant to its role. In this regard the review will assess the Department's:Performance in the past 10 years,Advice (appropriateness and quality), forecasts, risk analysis (including of non-consensual opinion) and communications strategy, and,Development and management of responses to the current crisis.This assessment should have regard to the policy, legal and institutional framework within which the Department worked during this period.The Group will, based on the conclusions and lessons drawn from this assessment, make recommendations for the future development, structure and resourcing of the Department.  In making its recommendations the Group will have regard to best practice regarding the organisational structures, skills, training, staff mix and levels required by a modern Finance Ministry in order that it can best fulfil its role in relation to (i) economic and financial management; (ii) policy analysis, development, advice and implementation; and, (iii) communication, transparency and accountability.  The Group will provide its full report and recommendations within three months."The Reviewers will, as would be expected, be free to consider what matters they regard as relevant to their Terms of Reference.

The FR has advised that this charge is to cover the costs associated with sending a cheque for "collection".The FR has also advised me that each charge is assessed on the basis of the criteria set out in the Consumer Credit Act 1995 i.e.:a) the promotion of fair competition,b) the commercial justification provided for the introduction of the charge,c) a credit institution passing any costs on to its customers, andd) the impact on customers.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1115	I am happy that substantial progress is being made on implementation of the Public Service Agreement 2010 to 2014 (Croke Park Agreement) and that all the terms of the Agreement are currently being complied with within the civil service.  In particular, the Agreement has resulted in the cessation of industrial action and a number of the instruments indicated in the Agreement for the civil service, including the redeployment arrangements, are now in place.  That will facilitate the redeployment of any staff who become surplus for any reason across Government Departments.After its ratification in July, Mr P J Fitzpatrick was appointed, along with nominees each from public service management and the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Implementation Body.  That Body will review the implementation of the transformation agenda for each sector with the relevant management and unions.  It will also be responsible for verifying savings derived from the implementation of the Agreement and its sectoral components in the context of the review of public service pay proposed next year.Since its establishment, the Body has concentrated on the implementation of the Agreement, including putting in place strong structures at sectoral level and seeking from public service management their action plans for the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement.  The plans, due for submission this week, will form an initial template for the implementation of the terms of the sectoral agreements which form part of the overall Agreement and set out a clear agenda for change within each sector, including within Government Departments.  It is intended that these action plans will develop in a dynamic way over the four year period the Agreement, in the context of Government policy on budgetary and other matters.  The Government is determined that public service management will be proactive and ambitious in delivering on the full range of productivity and change measures envisaged in the Agreement, and accepted as necessary by all parties to it.  Strong oversight by the Implementation Body will be an important factor in this.Government policy on staff numbers in the public service is reflected in employment control frameworks for each sector of the public service.  In this regard, the Exchequer Pay Bill is estimated to reduce by 8% in 2010 over 2009 while the number of public servants has reduced by almost 11,000 since March 2009.  However, the efficiencies and other measures arising from the Agreement provide a sustainable framework to manage the provision and delivery of our essential public services with reductions in public service numbers and in a period of unprecedented pressure on resources.

The provision in the 2010 Estimate for such professional advice is €4.3m and I expect that the costs will remain within this Estimate.  A further provision of €2m is included in the Vote 6 2010 Estimate in respect of the Banking Inquiry.  Mr. Peter Nyberg has commenced the process of recruiting experts to assist in this Inquiry and the costs in 2010 are expected to remain within budget.2011 Estimates are not yet finalised but it is likely that there will be a continuing need for provisions for both Banking Consultancies and the Banking Inquiry in 2011.  The work of the Banking Inquiry is expected to be completed by mid-2011.

The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission — who control and manage the Fund — publish a report on the performance of the NPRF as of the end of each quarter on the Commission's website www.nprf.ie.  The most recent such report, to 30 June 2010, valued the Fund at €24.1 billion.The value of the discretionary portfolio (investments made under the Fund's investment policy and for which the Commission is responsible) was €17.3 billion as of 30 June 2010.  The value of the investments in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc, made by the Fund at the direction of the Minister for Finance, was €6.8 billion at the same date.  This latter figure does not include €491 million in cash received by the NPRF in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued by Bank of Ireland in conjunction with the preference stock.  This warrant cancellation formed part of the NPRF's participation in the capital-raising exercise announced by Bank of Ireland on 26 April 2010.  This receipt has been allocated to the Fund's discretionary portfolio.

This involves splitting the existing bank into an Asset Recovery bank and a Funding bank.  As part of this process the necessity or otherwise for the introduction of specific new legislation to underpin the implementation of the plan is being considered.  Once this work is complete I will be in better position to advise the Deputy on the necessity or otherwise of new legislation.

While this issue is primarily a tax matter, I continue to take soundings from Ministers with responsibility for both tourism and transport.  The air travel tax was one of a number of Budgetary measures introduced that was necessary in the context of an overall response to the fiscal challenges we face and represents a genuine effort to broaden the tax base in a fair and equitable manner.  I have stated before that the impact of the tax on passenger numbers is being overstated.As the Deputy will be aware, Germany has announced plans to introduce an air travel tax with effect from 1 January 2011.

The Committee included representatives of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs, as well as officials from my Department and representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency as Manager of the NPRF.In its work, the Committee has considered the appropriateness and possible nature of an ethical investment policy for the NPRF. The approaches to ethical/responsible investment taken in other countries, including Norway, have been reviewed, and submissions from a number of civil society organisations have also been considered.  The Deputy will also be aware that the NPRF was a founding signatory in April 2006 to the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment which seek to integrate environmental, social and governance issues, in addition to financial issues, into investment analysis and decision-making.The report of the Committee has been submitted to me and I expect to bring proposals to Government shortly.

Income collected in public statutory hospitals is accounted for through Appropriations-in-Aid and netted off the Gross Vote.  Income collected in public voluntary hospitals is retained by the hospital and the grant provided by the HSE takes account of this income being available to these hospitals to support the overall level of expenditure.  In this way, all income collected through these charges forms part of the funding of the public health service.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Act, 2010, once commenced.The papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption were deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on 28th July 2010.  In accordance with Article 46.1 of the Convention, the Convention enters into force for Ireland on 1 November 2010.  It is my understanding that the Vietnamese National Assembly has recently passed legislation which should allow for a move to ratification of the Hague Convention.  In the event that both Ireland and Vietnam ratify the Convention there is every reason to expect that adoptions from Vietnam could re-commence subject to the provisions of the Convention and the legislation in both Countries being met in this regard.As both countries will have ratified the Hague Convention there will be no need for a formal bi-lateral agreement with regard to inter-country adoption.  At the time of ratification Ireland and Vietnam will each designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Hague Convention.  Administrative arrangements will be a matter for the Adoption Authority, as Ireland's designated Central Authority, to make with the designated Vietnamese Central Authority.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	I have introduced a number of measures in the past year to reduce the costs of drugs and medicines for both the State and consumers.  These measures have included a reduction in the wholesale and retail mark-ups under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and new price agreements with IPHA (Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association) and APMI (Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland) which have reduced the price of hundreds of the most commonly prescribed off-patent medicines by 40%.  Cumulatively these measures are expected to deliver savings to the State of over €200m in 2010.I was most concerned to learn that some pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of these price and margin reductions to those patients whose expenditure on drug purchases are not met by the Health Service Executive e.g. persons whose monthly expenditure is below the €120 per month threshold under the Drugs Payment Scheme.  I have raised this matter with the Irish Pharmacy Union.  It is disappointing that some pharmacists are withholding the benefit of the lower prices from some of their customers.  The public deserve better in these difficult economic times.The Code of Conduct for Pharmacists issued by the Pharmacy Regulator (The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland) requires pharmacists, amongst other things, to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines, health-related products and services provided by them.  Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. Patients have every right to ask a pharmacist the reasons for the price they are being charged and if dissatisfied can, if they so choose, transfer their custom to an alternative pharmacy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1144	There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, therapy services over the last number of years. A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Skills in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates. The Government has invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. Clinical education is an essential component of the therapy degree programmes. Undergraduate students from the therapy professions must complete up to 1000 clinical placement hours as part requirement for their undergraduate qualification. The current minimum standards for the education of therapy graduates provides that each student will complete sufficient hours or fieldwork to ensure the integration of theory into practice. These placements are arranged to ensure that all students have adequate exposure to key aspects of practice in relevant settings and are fully necessary to equip and enable health and social care professional graduates to practice safely and in a manner which will ensure the provision of high-quality interventions, meeting the challenges of increasingly complex and evolving care for service users, whilst providing the highest level of patient care and service.With regard to the continued recruitment of therapy professionals, my Department has written to the Health Service Executive setting out the overall approved employment control ceiling for 2010. As part of this approval, written confirmation has been provided to the HSE that the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and the payment of acting up allowances does not apply to specific designated grades. Delegated sanction has been given to the HSE for the creation and filling of frontline posts including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy posts. The approval indicated that vacancies in existing posts in these grades may continue to be filled. New posts may also be created in these grades, up to a specified limit, provided that the HSE is satisfied in each case that there is no scope to redeploy an equivalent post from the hospital sector to the primary and community care sector. This moratorium exemption provides for an increase in the number of therapy posts, in line with Government policy, in order to meet the requirements of integrated care delivery and primary care needs particularly in respect of children at risk, the elderly and those with disabilities.

Phase 1 of the NPRO involves the construction of new facilities at Beaumont and St James's Hospitals, with four linear accelerators in each. These new centres will be completed at the end of this year, at which time some staff and resources from St Luke's will transfer to these centres. The three facilities will then form the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network for Dublin Mid-Leinster and Dublin North-East. This will provide adequate capacity to deal with patient needs until at least 2015.Phase 2 of the NPRO will be delivered through Public Private Partnership and will provide additional capacity at Beaumont, St James's, Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway. Satellite centres will also be developed at the MidWestern Regional Hospital in Limerick (linked to University Hospital Galway) and at Waterford Regional Hospital (linked to Cork University Hospital). The procurement process for these facilities awaits the Government's consideration of the Public Sector Benchmark for the Plan.The Plan also involves support for the development of facilities at Altnagelvin by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland, as a number of patients from Donegal travel to St Luke's Hospital at present for radiation oncology services.  The Business Case for this development has now been finalised and is awaiting approval by Minister McGimpsey.  I have committed to providing a capital contribution to the Project, in recognition of the fact that approximately one third of the patients who will attend the Altnagelvin Centre will be from Donegal and the surrounding areas.

The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1157	The entitlement of an individual to services under the Health (Amendment) Act, l996 now rests with the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the definition of eligibility inserted in the Health (Amendment) Act 2006 by section 6 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received after the specified date of 20th June 2006.  In respect of persons who have made an application after 20th June 2006, the legal position is clear and unambiguous.In respect of persons who made an application before that date, the Chief Executive Officer is still obliged to satisfy himself that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C.  In that regard, I have asked the HSE to take account of any relevant decision of the Hepatitis C & HIV Compensation Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal arrives at its decisions after careful consideration of expert testimony.I have given a great deal of consideration to the issue of women who have neither a positive test result nor a positive Tribunal decision in their favour and I am very sympathetic to the women in question.  While this cohort of women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C has had, and may continue to have, a variety of symptoms, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression are common conditions that occur in the general population. It is estimated that up to16,000 people were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these people were infected with Hepatitis C.  I have to take into account the rationale which led to the clarification of eligibility requirements in 2006 and accordingly, I do not envisage a change in the current eligibility requirements.I should point out that the women in question are entitled to apply for a regular medical card. Application forms for a medical card are available from the HSE's local health offices. The HSE has discretion to award a regular medical card to a person whose income is over the financial guidelines, where the HSE decides that the financial burden of medical or other exceptional circumstances would cause undue hardship.

This facility will provide single room en-suite inpatient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with Cystic Fibrosis, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities.Tenders for this development were received and have been evaluated. A letter of intent has been issued to the preferred bidder and it is intended to award the contract for construction as soon as possible once all relevant pre-contract processes have been completed and necessary arrangements made. The hospital  has been actively engaged in seeking to conclude this stage and significant progress has been made recently in this regard.The contract, once awarded, will require 18 months for construction of the new facility, which means that completion is now expected in early 2012.The process is under continuous review in order to ensure earliest possible delivery of the new ward block. St Vincent's University Hospital and the HSE remain committed to this project and are taking every possible step to expediate contract award and earliest commencement of construction on site.

Cases of active and latent TB found have been referred for appropriate treatment and follow up care. All involved with the school have been reassured that (i) the children with active TB are on treatment and are not currently infectious (ii) children or staff with latent TB infection are not infectious and (iii) other children, or staff, are not at risk from contact with either the cases of active TB or of latent TB.In order to assess the position fully, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department immediately requested the HSE to provide clarification and information regarding the routine administration of BCG in all regions of the country, for them to identify areas where this is not the case and specify what arrangements are being made to deliver these services and a timescale for implementation. The HSE has also been requested to plan for the undertaking of an on-going audit of the delivery of BCG/TB services throughout the country. The service issues in the questions raised by the Deputies with regard to numbers of staff involved in BCG and Mantoux testing, clinical provision and the requested tabular data have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The legislation provides for two different classes of person for the purpose of levying a charge.Class 1Class 1 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.Class 2Class 2 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 amend the 2005 regulations and provide for the first increase in the level of long stay charges payable since 2005.  The following revised level of charges will apply.In the case of Class 1 a weekly charge of €153.25 or the weekly income of that person less €44.70, whichever is the lesser. In the case of Class 2 a weekly charge of €114.95 or the weekly income of that person less €70.25 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.The actual charge levied will vary from person to person depending on individual circumstances and under the legislation the Health Service Executive can waive or reduce the charges to avoid undue financial hardship.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1170	The Government's decision to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million. There are no plans to reverse these changes.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available. The remaining care provision is subject to prior approval, which will be required from a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for:High risk and exceptional patients,Those requiring emergency care, andPatients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.Where prior approval is required for the treatment, the HSE Principal Dental Surgeons will apply their professional judgment to determine, in the circumstances, whether or not there is a clinical emergency, and whether or not treatment should therefore be approved. The HSE will also monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. With regard to the provision of speech and language therapy services, this is a service matter and it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1172	The HSE is working within limited financial resources. The appropriate management of the public finances means that the health sector, which represents over 27% of public expenditure, must operate within the approved budget set out at the start of the year.  The key objectives to be addressed within this budget are patient safety and the protection of services.  The HSE's 2010 Service Plan targeted delivery of the same overall levels of service as were achieved last year.  So far this year these service targets are being met and, indeed, in some cases exceeded.As the Deputy is aware, the National Service Plan 2010 also contained a number of economic and cost avoidance measures for 2010 (in addition to a continuation of 2009 measures). The Government made significant decisions on pay reductions, non-pay spending, revenue raising and employment control in the Budget. The HSE is implementing these measures in order to deliver the Service Plan within its available resources.  It is clear that the financial challenges underpinning the HSE's delivery of the Service Plan, while achievable, continue to require careful budgetary management across the organisation and its funded agencies.With regard to budgetary issues in the West, at the end of March HSE West was facing a projected end year deficit of €130m.  Significant cost containment efforts have been undertaken. The latest indication from the HSE West is that at the end of August there is a potential year end excess of €49m. This represents a substantial reduction on the projected excess but obviously demands continued management of expenditure. At a Labour Relations Commission hearing in August, the HSE West and the health sector unions signed a framework document agreeing to engage with one another on addressing the budget deficit whilst protecting jobs and services.  This offers the best approach in meeting the health care needs of the people of the region.Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government is determined to do everything possible to protect patient services, to respond to priority demographic and other needs and to support ongoing reform of the public heath services within the resources available for health. To achieve this, staff at all levels will have to work together to deliver services in a more flexible way. Without that co-operation and flexibility, services to patients cannot be protected. There is responsibility on everyone involved to deliver services within budget in new ways that will serve patient needs in accordance with international practice.

This is a reduction of 126 (23%) on the number employed at the end of December 2004. In 2009 alone, 56 staff  left the Department as a result of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement, the Incentivised Career Break Scheme, normal age-related retirement or by way of redeployment to other departments. In line with the Employment Control Framework (ECF) setting out Government policy on numbers employed in the public service, the Department must further reduce its staffing to a core Department of around 400 by 2012. We will use appropriate mechanisms, including redeployment, to adhere to our ECF targets.Notwithstanding the overall reductions referred to above, an additional three staff members have been assigned to the Board recently, and arrangements have also been made to deal with existing backlogs through overtime working.Following recent enactment of the Adoption Act 2010 the Adoption Board is expected to be established as an independent Adoption Authority on 1st November 2010.

Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Act, 2010, once commenced.The papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption were deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on 28th July 2010. In accordance with Article 46.1 of the Convention, the Convention enters into force for Ireland on 1 November 2010.Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia in respect of adoption. Consideration of this matter is ongoing. I have been in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia as part of an assessment of adoption practice and the child welfare and protection systems in place in Ethiopia.The Adoption Act, 2010, contains a provision that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt. The provision requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.  In practice this will mean that persons with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability from the Adoption Board issued prior to 1 November 2010 can continue the adoption, provided it is a Hague standard adoption.

'Reach Out' the National Strategy for Action on Suicide calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.  Implementation of these Strategies is a matter for the HSE.   Initiatives which have been progressed by the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) include:the development and implementation of national training programmes — to date approximately 18,000 people have been trained in the 2 day ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) internationally recognised programme and over 2,000 have been trained in the half day SafeTalk programme;development of a media monitoring mechanism;availability of self-harm services through Hospital Emergency Departments;implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services;supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention;developing mental health awareness campaigns —‘Your Mental Health’  awareness campaign and the ‘Let some one know’ campaign aimed at young people.an information booklet entitled ‘Suicide Prevention in the Workplace’ which provides organisations and workplaces with practical guidance on how to respond to and support persons who are at risk of suicidal behaviour has been made available.On 1 September the Government announced additional funding of almost €1million under the Dormant Accounts Fund for a programme of suicide prevention measures.  The initiatives being funded will help communities to develop integrated local action plans for suicide prevention and will enhance the ability of communities to prevent suicidal behaviour at all levels of risk, and are consistent with ‘Reach Out’.
In April this year, I was pleased to launch a National Stigma Reduction Campaign, ‘See Change’.  The aim of ‘See Change’ is to  positively change social attitudes and behaviour, to inspire people to challenge their beliefs about mental illness and to be more open in their attitudes and behaviour and to encourage people in distress to seek help.  A network of national and local organisations across the country will carry the anti-stigma message through local broadcasts, local print media and a range of other activities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1185	Consultation fees charged to private patients by general practitioners, consultants and dentists are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees. My colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has also called on providers of professional services in the private sector to adjust their fees in line with the reductions in fees of those providing such services in the public sector. I should add that General Practitioners who hold General Medical Services contracts with the Health Service Executive must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment.With regard to dental costs, the Competition Authority's report on dental services in 2007 made a number of recommendations that should  encourage greater competition and better value for consumers. Some of its recommendations are already being implemented, while others will be addressed in the forthcoming National Oral Health Policy.

Acting on this advice, the HSE decided to cease all emergency surgery at the hospital immediately, with effect from 1 September 2010.The transfer of acute and emergency surgery from Our Lady's Hospital, Navan was always a long-term objective of the North East Transformation Plan. The Plan is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.The HSE has put a rota in place to manage patients safety. It is underpinned by a Standard Operating Policy (SOP), which clearly identifies the approach to be taken to managing patients who present to the Emergency Department at Navan and the responsibilities of various staff members.Minor elective surgery (i.e. requiring local anaesthetic only) and endoscopy will remain in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. It is still also the regional centre for elective orthopaedic surgery.

For ease of reference, I am presenting the information on a year by year basis.  The Deputy should note that the staffing figures quoted refer to staff located in external constituency offices and within the Department engaged in constituency office work.The column relating to constituency office costs refers to estimated costs incurred by my Department in the provision of certain services to a Minister's local constituency office. These costs relate in general to the provision phones, fax machines and/or photocopiers, IT equipment, software, configuration and consumable supplies. Where such items are requested by a Minister the policy in my Department is to provide them, where possible, from available stock.  When Ministers complete their term of office at my Department these items are returned. It should be noted that these costs do not relate to rental or other maintenance costs of non-Departmental property.Ministers also utilise some office space for constituency work at the Department's headquarters building. However, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of utility and ICT costs as such costs are not broken down by unit in my Department's records. However, the space involved is minimal and associated costs negligible as the overall building must be maintained and fitted out in a manner appropriate for all staff working at the Department.YearMinisterStaff WTE*Total Cost of Staffing & ExpensesExternal Constituency Office LocationDepartmental PropertyUtility Estimated CostsICT Estimated Costs€€€2010Harney260,459————Andrews3102,733Dun Laoghaire,Co DublinNo701—Moloney3104,267Mountmellick, Co.

Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1207	The new Childcare Education and Training Scheme (CETS) was introduced in September of this year and is being implemented by my Office, on behalf of FAS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) under the Department of Education and Science.The CETS scheme replaces the previous childcare support schemes implemented by FAS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  Under the FAS and VEC schemes, qualifying students and trainees attending certain FAS and VEC courses could apply for a childcare support payment of up to €63.50 per week towards their childcare costs.  Under the new CETS scheme, participating services are paid a weekly capitation fee of €170 for each full-time childcare place contracted with their service with lesser amounts obtaining for half day and afterschool places.  In return, the service is required to provide a childcare place free of charge to the qualifying student or trainee.Childcare places have been contracted in each location on the basis of information on the expected local demand, on the basis of information provided to my Office by FAS and the VECs.  The local City and County Childcare Committees, which help the Childcare Directorate of my Office to implement its early childhood care and education programmes, have also assisted this process.  FAS and the VECs continue to be responsible for determining whether students and trainees qualify for childcare support and will advise them of where CETS places are being provided.  There is no change in the number of places provided for under the new arrangements and almost 3,000 full-time equivalent childcare places will be supported in services throughout the State.Given the more generous provision under the scheme, to assist parents into employment through training and education, the new arrangements are expected to cost €23 million in a full year, €13 million more than under the previous arrangements.

Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.All applications from or in respect of persons who were admitted to long stay residences are assessed within this legal framework and only the specific charges outlined above are repayable under the Health Repayment Scheme.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1222	The Government has decided to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution of medicines.  This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients.In June, I launched a report, prepared by a joint working group made up of officials and healthcare professionals from my Department and the HSE, which sets out a proposed model for the operation of generic substitution and reference pricing in Ireland. The working group consulted with a wide range of stakeholders as part of its work. Decisions about the interchangeability of medicines will be evidence-based and take into account best practice elsewhere. I expect to see significant progress on the implementation of this initiative, including the identification of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1241	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 677 and 678 together.I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year and provides a free pre-school year to all children within a certain age range in the year before they commence primary school.The ECCE scheme is a universal scheme which provides for one free pre-school year in early childhood care and education (ECCE) for all children within the qualifying age range.  The scheme takes account of the fact that some children with special needs may benefit from a mainstream pre-school setting at an later age than would normally be the case, by allowing an extension of the upper limit of the age range within which children qualify.  In addition, the scheme allows children with special needs to avail of the pre-school year on a pro-rata basis over two years, for example for two days per week in the first year and then for three days per week in the second year.It is recognised that the introduction of the scheme has raised a number of issues in relation to service provision and supports for children with special needs and the need to ensure a coherent approach across both specialist and mainstream settings.  While many children with special needs may require specialist services, others will benefit from attending mainstream services or a mixture of the two.  To achieve these outcomes, earlier this year this office asked the office of disability and mental health to set up a working group to look at existing services and supports and the allocation of resources for pre-school children with special needs.  This group is expected to report shortly following which the arrangements for children with special needs under the ECCE scheme will be further considered.In the meantime while the scheme as initiated does not provide for any additional provision for children with special needs, pending any arrangements which are put in place following the report of the working group, a limited number of children with severe disabilities who had availed of the scheme in the introductory period of January to June 2010 have been approved for re-entry into the scheme in September 2010, the first full year of the scheme, on an exceptional basis in respect of that academic year only.More than 53,000 children availed of the free pre-school provision in the period January to August 2010 and applications by approximately 63,000 children have been submitted for entry to the scheme for the school year which commenced in September.  As a universal scheme available to all children, data in respect of the number of participating in the scheme who have special needs, is not collected.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1245	Consultation fees charged to private patients by General Practitioners are a matter of private contract between the doctor and the patient.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect General Practitioners to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  The Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners states that the fees charged should be appropriate to the service provided and that patients should be informed of the likely costs before the consultation and treatment.I should add that General Practitioners who hold General Medical Services contracts with the Health Service Executive must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment and this includes the provision of prescriptions and repeat prescriptions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1246	The 2010 to 2012 Health Sector Employment Control Framework has been approved by the Minister for Finance and issued to the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The framework includes specific provision for the filling of up to 30 staff nurse posts per annum, by way of an exemption from the moratorium on recruitment, in order to facilitate the appointment of successful students from the sponsorship scheme referred to by the Deputy. This provision reflects the outcome of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to this matter. I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of such staff nurse posts that have been filled in 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1250	There are no plans for persons in receipt of a medical card as a result of a UK entitlement to lose the dental benefit element of their entitlement.The Government's decision announced in Budget 2010 to limit the funding available to the dental treatment services scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders, including persons in receipt of a medical card as a result of a UK entitlement, and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available. The remaining care provision is subject to prior approval, which will be required from a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for: high risk and exceptional patients; those requiring emergency care, and; patients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.Where prior approval is required for the treatment, the HSE principal dental surgeons will apply their professional judgment to determine, in the circumstances, whether or not there is a clinical emergency, and whether or not treatment should therefore be approved. The HSE will also monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1255	My Department does not retain the records requested by the Deputy regarding the number of man hours of overtime worked or the associated costs, in external agencies (the HSE and non-commercial state-sponsored bodies) under the aegis of my Department.Accordingly, I have referred this part of the question (overtime man hours and costs) to the executive, for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  My Department is also writing to the relevant non-commercial state sponsored bodies to ask that they provide a response in relation to their organisation.  This material will then be compiled by my Department and forwarded to the Deputy, as soon as it is available.With regard to the Deputy's query concerning overtime premia which apply for overtime working at different times and for callouts, where workers are on call, I am informed that there are different methods used in the calculation of such payments, depending on the category of worker involved (e.g. Nursing, Dental, clerical/admin, etc.), and the duty being carried out.  Chapter 3 of the HSE publication entitled Terms and Conditions of Employment (May 2009) deals with the after hours attendance arrangements and payments for such which generally apply in the public health service.  I have asked that a copy of this publication be sent to the Deputy, for his information.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1256	The Health Research Board (HRB) is the statutory agency for funding projects in all areas of health research.  The HRB has worked closely with Duchenne Ireland and in March 2009 met with representatives from Duchenne Ireland to discuss the joint HRB/medical research charities group funding programme for medical research projects.  I understand that two research applications supported by Duchenne Ireland were successful in obtaining funding in the most recent call for proposals under the scheme.Following the Dáil Debate regarding muscular dystrophy in 2009 I met with Duchenne Ireland and discussed a range of issues including research, clinical trials, the registry and standards of care for the treatment of boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy.There are a number of barriers and obstacles which exist in relation to the proposals in relation to Duchenne muscular dystrophy research, standards of care and the inclusion of Irish boys in international clinical trials, The most significant being the identification of a clinical lead in Ireland. However, in an effort to progress the issues, the Department contacted the TREAT — NMD trial site in Newcastle, England and Minister Harney met with Duchenne Ireland and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland on the 3rd June this year. The meeting also included representatives from the HSE, HRB and a consultant paediatric neurologist.The Department is now awaiting a written proposal in relation to the development of a clinical trial site in Ireland and/or linking with European trials in the assessment and treatment of neuromuscular diseases.The Department has also asked the HSE's clinical care directorate to consider the standards of care protocol in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy in developing paediatric models of care for Ireland.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1267	With the exception of charges paid by certain persons attending accident and emergency departments, no statutory charges are payable by patients receiving public outpatient services. This includes diagnostic tests referred by general practitioners to public hospitals.General practitioners who hold General Medical Services contracts with the Health Service Executive must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders in respect of routine treatment, including the provision of diagnostic tests.Consultation fees charged to private patients by general practitioners are a matter of private contract between the doctor and the patient.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1270	We have high rates of patients who do not attend for outpatient appointments in our hospitals.  This results in a poor use of clinical and administrative resources.  It is important that outpatient services, as a key point of access for patients to acute hospital services, operate efficiently and that people referred to them can be seen without delay.  The HSE's National Service Plan 2010 identifies a number of measures being taken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of outpatient services and to increase the proportion of new attendees within the overall numbers attending.  These include the proactive management of appointments and more appropriate discharge of frequent attenders back to primary care services.  The plan also includes a performance target for non-attendance ("DNA") by patients of not more than 10%, for both new and return attendees.  It is a matter for the HSE, working with the hospitals, to develop appropriate measures to support the attainment of these targets.The HSE publishes monthly reports on its performance and this includes, in the acute hospital services section of the supplementary report, detailed data on the DNA rates for individual hospitals.  The website address for the performance reportselishttp://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Publications/corporate/Performance_Reports_Monthly.html

The Health Act, 2007 provides for the registration and inspection of nursing homes, both private and public.  The Act assigns responsibility for the registration and inspection function to the independent chief inspector of social services, part of  the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It is a matter for the chief inspector to decide whether certain facilities meet the definition of a designated centre and are therefore subject to this regime.While I am aware that the HSE has written directly to the authority I have not received any request to have the facilities the Deputy is referring to de-listed.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a review of the Regulations will begin shortly.  The Department will bear in mind issues raised, including issues specific to this type of residential facility, in the context of this review.

Monitoring is undertaken in Local Health Offices by Monitoring Officers.  In addition independent inspection and monitoring is undertaken by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA).In September, 2009 the Health Information Quality Authority commenced an inspection of the foster care services in Local Health Offices Dublin North West, North Central and North Dublin.  They published their reports in July, 2010 and the HSE submitted action plans to address all the issues raised.  The recommendations are being implemented.  Regular meetings have taken place between HIQA and the HSE since October, 2009 to monitor and review progress.  Inspectors will undertake follow up inspection to ensure the recommendations have been implemented.In October, 2009 the Health Service Executive undertook a National Audit of compliance with its obligations in relation to foster care and relative care as prescribed in the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995, and the National Standards for Foster Care, 2003 across the 32 Local Health Offices.  An action plan is being implemented which will address the recommendations arising from the National Audit.The Ryan Report which has been adopted by the Government recommended the recruitment of an additional 200 social workers to assist the delivery of children and family services nationally.  54 of these posts were allocated to HSE Dublin North East.  A total of 36 staff have already commenced with a further 6 due to take up their posts in October, and the remainder scheduled to be in post by the end of 2010.The HIQA published on 27th September 2010 a report of an inspection of four Local Health Areas in HSE South.  Overall the findings from this inspection were positive; however there were deficits in the formal assessment of some relative carers and up to 25 children of the 690 in foster care did not have an allocated social worker due to staff maternity leave.  The HSE South has recently recruited new social workers, some of whom will work with children in foster care to ensure their needs are met.

The Integrated Design Team, appointed in October 2009, completed the concept designs for the new children's hospital and the Ambulatory & Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght in February 2010.I can confirm that I remain committed to this project and am very pleased to note that the planning of the new hospital is proceeding. Construction of the hospital is due to be completed by the end of 2014. The development costs for the hospital are currently under detailed review by the Board. The development will be funded through a combination of direct Exchequer funding and other sources, including philanthropic contributions. The overall development costs will be known following completion of the competitive tendering exercise and are expected to reflect the increased value for money currently applying to large construction contracts.

I am happy to confirm my commitment to the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre to be situated at Tallaght which is an essential part of the development.  The decision to provide ambulatory and emergency care services at Tallaght is based on recommendations made in the reports of McKinsey and Co (2006) and international health service consultants, RKW (2007).  The services planned for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght will meet the majority of paediatric ambulatory care needs, with all in-patient care provided in one hospital that can cater for in-patient requirements up to and including the safe management of the deterioration of a child's condition and internal transfer to critical care if required.My Department is advised by the National Paediatric Development Board that the services planned for the Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght  are as follows:1. Emergency Care  This unit will have 8 short-stay observation beds for children who do not require admission but require observation in the urgent care centre prior to discharge.2. Day Care provided through 28 day care beds3. Out-patients provided through 26 consultation examination rooms.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 739 and 778 together.I have introduced a number of measures in the past year to reduce the costs of drugs and medicines for both the State and consumers.  These measures have included a reduction in the wholesale and retail mark-ups under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 and new price agreements with IPHA (Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association) and APMI (Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland) which have reduced the price of hundreds of the most commonly prescribed off-patent medicines by 40%.  Cumulatively these measures are expected to deliver savings to the State of over €200m in 2010.I was most concerned to learn that some pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of these price and margin reductions to those patients whose expenditure on drug purchases are not met by the Health Service Executive e.g. persons whose monthly expenditure is below the €120 per month threshold under the Drugs Payment Scheme.  I have raised this matter with the Irish Pharmacy Union.  It is disappointing that some pharmacists are withholding the benefit of the lower prices from some of their customers.  The public deserve better in these difficult economic times.The Code of Conduct for Pharmacists issued by the Pharmacy Regulator (The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland) requires pharmacists, amongst other things, to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines, health-related products and services provided by them. Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. Patients have every right to ask a pharmacist the reasons for the price they are being charged and if dissatisfied can, if they so choose, transfer their custom to an alternative pharmacy.I am not aware of any increases in the prices of the products referred to by the Deputy. The prices of individual medicines may be increased by the HSE in limited circumstances.  This aspect of the Deputy's question has been forwarded to the HSE for direct reply.

This group has a broad membership from key stakeholders and experts in the field of cystic fibrosis.I am aware that the HSE have provided for a dedicated Project lead for the Implementation of Cystic Fibrosis Screening who has commenced  on 1st September 2010. The screening programme will commence implementation once all the necessary general and specific screening programme governance arrangements are in place. In this regard the HSE are working to have the necessary staff in place.  However I am informed by the HSE that it is  envisaged that the actual screening will commence in 2011.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Act, 2010, once commenced.The papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption were deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on 28th July 2010. In accordance with Article 46.1 of the Convention, the Convention enters into force for Ireland on 1 November 2010.It is my understanding that the Vietnamese National Assembly has recently passed legislation which should allow for a move to ratification of the Hague Convention. In the event that both Ireland and Vietnam ratify the Convention there is every reason to expect that adoptions from Vietnam could re-commence subject to the provisions of the Convention and the legislation in both Countries being met in this regard.As both countries will have ratified the Hague Convention there will be no need for a formal bilateral agreement with regard to inter-country adoption. At the time of ratification Ireland and Vietnam will each designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Hague Convention. Administrative arrangements will be a matter for the Adoption Authority, as Ireland's designated Central Authority, to make with the designated Vietnamese Central Authority.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1323	I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year and which was participated in during January to August 2010 by more than 53,000 children.  Services participating in the scheme are required to make an electronic return to my Office at the start of the preschool year.  In September 2010, the return was required from services in the week ending 24 September and it should be noted that some of the recent data referred to below is still subject to final collation and verification.From the returns made by participating services earlier this month, it appears that some 63,000 children are currently enrolled in the scheme,  representing approximately 94% of children in the year prior to Junior Infants.   Given that further children are availing of their preschool year through the Early Start programme, in special services for children with special needs, Traveller preschools and under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme, it is estimated that some 97% of children are availing of a free preschool place.  I am delighted with such a high level of participation in the scheme after such a short period, and I believe this vindicates the Government's decision to introduce the scheme as quickly as possible.All services participating in the scheme are required to provide an age-appropriate educational programme regardless of whether they offer full day-care or sessional places.  A range of educational approaches are offered in preschool services including the Montessori method, Highscope, Steiner-Waldorf and play-based.  Whichever curricular method is followed, they are required to adhere to the principles of Síolta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education, and Aistear, the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework.The number of preschool services participating in the scheme has also increased from approximately 3,800 in January 2010 to 4,200 this September.  The number of places that will be available to the scheme in these services will vary as, in many services, it will be dependent on the level of demand for full day-care places.  However, services indicated in their returns that they had a combined total of approximately 20,400 vacancies which could be filled by ECCE qualifying children.  Of the 1,270 services offering full and part-time day-care, 5,500 ECCE vacancies are reported.  The remaining 14,900 ECCE vacancies were reported in sessional services.  These figures indicate that the total number of places currently being offered is in the region of 84,000 and that the average occupancy rate is in the region of 75%.  The day-care services also reported a combined total capacity, at any time, of just under 60,000 places.I do not believe that there is any credibility in the suggestion that parents are switching their children from full day-care to sessional services as a result of the ECCE scheme.  Children availing of the scheme in day-care settings may do so either while availing of full day-care (where the capitation is used to reduce the child-care fees), or by attending a free sessional place in that service.   Not alone do many children participating in the preschool year do so in day-care services, there are few if any parents for whom a 3-hour place in a sessional service will facilitate their participation in employment, education or training.  In fact, the evidence is that for the owners of many childcare services, the recession has reduced demand for their full day-care services very significantly, and the ECCE scheme, which provides a steady stream of income which is non-dependent on the level of local employment, has been instrumental in saving their businesses.In terms of the impact of the scheme on employment in the sector, the September return indicates that over 30,000 staff are working in participating services compared to some 23,000 staff when the scheme was introduced.  Given the reduced demand for day-care, it would appear that the scheme has been very beneficial in maintaining and increasing employment in the sector and this is further supported by the fact that the number of services participating in the scheme has increased by ten per cent between January and September 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1325	I presume the Deputy is referring to the application by the person, whose details are supplied, to have her professional qualifications recognised under  Directive 2005/36/EC  for the purposes of seeking employment in the publicly-funded  health service in Ireland.  Persons should not seek such employment unless their qualifications have been recognised.This Directive applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EU Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health and Children is the Competent Authority for the profession in question.   In the case of the health and social care professions, the Directive does not provide for automatic recognition of professional qualifications obtained in another Member State; it provides for an assessment, on a case-by-case basis,  of the qualifications of an applicant against those required to practise in the host member state.  If the activities covered by the profession in the home and the host member state are not comparable, then the qualifications cannot be recognised.  If the activities are comparable but deficits in the qualifications are identified, subsequent post-qualification professional experience of the applicant must be considered. If deficits still remain, the host Member State must offer an applicant a compensation measure, a choice of completing an adaptation period or taking an aptitude test.The Directive provides a mechanism under which non-Irish professional qualifications can be considered for recognition but it is acknowledged to be a very complicated piece of legislation.  The Directive should not be regarded as a "rubber-stamping" exercise; in the interest of the protection of public health and safety, and consumer protection,  the qualifications of applicants must be assessed to ensure that they meet the standard of qualifications required to practise at entry-level within the Health Service Executive.  The Directive provides for a decision to issue within 4 months of receipt of a complete application.It would be inappropriate to comment on individual applications but I am advised that, in the case of this person's application, she was asked to supply additional information, and that a decision should issue very shortly.

A Project Board representative of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (NI), the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive, and Cooperation And Working Together (CAWT) was established to oversee the Study.  The Study examined the potential for joint co-operation in health across an extensive range of health and social care services and makes a number of recommendations for future cooperation. The Study was conducted jointly and it was agreed would constitute a report to the two Ministers.  Any action arising, including a decision to formally publish the Report, requires the agreement of both parties.The Study was completed in 2009 and was presented to Ministers in April that year. While I have indicated my approval for the Study's recommendations, in a discussion with the Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland in June this year, he informed me that he was not satisfied to endorse the Study.  However, it would be wrong to assume that the non publication of this Study implies that there is no cooperation on health matters. Cross Border working on health has existed for many years and both Departments continue to collaborate on a wide range of health and social care issues. Currently, some of these issues include Radiotherapy Services, Paediatric Congenital Cardiac Services, Emergency Planning, Child Protection, Health Promotion, Cancer Research and Suicide Prevention.Both Health Ministers meet regularly under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council and continually review the existing arrangements for cooperation and explore other areas for collaboration where mutual benefit for both populations is demonstrated.

In this regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. With regard to the provision of podiatry services, this is a service matter and it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1339	The Health (Amendment) (No 2) Act 2010 provides that from 1st October 2010, medical card holders will pay a 50c charge for items supplied to them by community pharmacists on the prescription of a GP, dentist or nurse who is entitled to prescribe.  The charges will be subject to a cap of €10 per month for each person or family.Where a person or family pays more than €10 per month the HSE will issue refunds automatically on a quarterly basis based on information received from the pharmacy. Where a person considers that they have not received the refund due, the person can apply on-line or on a refund claim form, to make a claim for a refund from the HSE.I do not expect that the introduction of prescription charges will have any significant ongoing resource implications in terms of costs or staffing.It is estimated that the yield from prescription charges will be about €2 million per month.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1340	Details of the number of medical card holders and GP visit card holders are provided by the Health Service Executive to my Department on a monthly basis. The most recent figures received from the Executive reflect the position as at the 1st August 2010 and show 1,568,269 medical card holders and 109,075 GP visit card holders on that date.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1341	There are two main cost factors associated with medical cards and GP visit cards, firstly the capitation and other fees made to General Practitioners (GPs) and, secondly, the cost of drugs supplied to patients.GPs who hold contracts under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme with the Health Service Executive (HSE) are remunerated through a range of fees and payments, most of which were amended in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009, which came into effect on 7th July 2009.  Included among these fees are more than 50 different capitation fees, which vary depending on the age and gender of the patient and the distance he or she lives from the GP's surgery.  For example, fees currently range from €76.98 for a male patient under 5 years living 3 miles or less from the GP's surgery to €218.37 for a female aged 65-70 years living more than 10 miles from the surgery.  In addition, there are special capitation rates of €280.31 for persons aged 70 and over residing at home and €896.07 for persons aged 70 and over residing in private nursing homes. There is also a range of additional payments; for example, in respect of out-of-hours consultations, temporary residents, special items of services (e.g. suturing), panel size, practice support allowances and locum expenses.As regards the supply of drugs and medicines, effective from 1st October 2010, medical card holders will only have to pay a prescription charge of 50 cent per item subject to a maximum of €10 per month for each person or family.  GP visit card holders avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme, which now involves a co-payment of the first €120 spent per family in any calendar month.  Drugs costs vary significantly depending on the patient's medical condition.My Department has been in contact with the HSE in relation to the average cost of a medical card per annum and the Executive has indicated that, given there were 1,568,269 medical card holders and 109,075 GP visit card holders on the 1st August, 2010, the variety of payment arrangements and the variation in drug costs under the GMS Scheme, a single average annual cost figure in respect of the medical card and GP visit card is not a sufficiently refined measure for policy options and decisions.The estimated total expenditure in 2009 on the GMS Scheme was approximately €1.85 billion.  The HSE Service Plan for 2010 shows the projected cost of the GMS Scheme this year as €2.032 billion.  The Service Plan also shows a projected increase in medical card and GP visit card numbers of 144,000 and 16,111 respectively for 2010.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1342	The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.  Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects.The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.There is a requirement on each of the successful bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.   The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1343	The Government's policy is to achieve fair access by patients to publicly-funded hospital capacity based on clinical need. While patients may be treated in public hospitals on a private basis, the primary role of the public hospital system is to provide services for public patients. The 2008 consultants' contract includes new measures to strengthen the management, monitoring and control of public-private activity in hospitals with a view to ensuring that the level of consultant private practice within public hospitals does not exceed the permitted ratio. Subject to that being achieved, the contract provides for the recovery of whatever income is due in respect of that level of private practice. These contractual features complement existing bed designation rules as part of the overall framework to control the level of private activity in publicly funded hospitals.My Department has asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy on the detailed operational matters that he has raised.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1344	Medical Consultants working in the public health service are employed by either the Health Service Executive or a Voluntary Hospital.  In this regard my Department does not have specific details of average salaries paid to medical consultants and I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy concerning these.More generally, 90% of permanent consultants working in the public health service signed up to Consultant Contract 2008.  The three main types of contract which were introduced under Consultant Contract 2008 are:Type A: Medical Consultants who hold this type of contract work exclusively for the public hospital and are remunerated solely by way of salary.  They are not permitted to engage in any private practice.  The salary scale for this type of contract ranges between €176,000 and €192,492 depending on geographical location and whether or not the consultant previously held the 1997 Consultant Contract.Type B: Medical Consultants who hold this type of contract work for the public hospital but may engage in limited private practice on the public hospital campus (including in a co-located hospital) up to a maximum of 20% of total clinical throughput.  The salary scale for this type of contract ranges between €172,865 and €183,562 depending on geographical location and whether or not the consultant previously held the 1997 Consultant Contract.Type B*: This contract was available to medical consultants who held a Category II Contract and Consultants in Emergency Medicine who held a Category I Contract under the 1997 Consultants Contract.  The Type B* Contract permits consultants to engage in private practice in facilities operated by the employer or in co-located private hospitals on the public hospital campus. Consultants holding this type of contract may also engage in private practice in locations outside the public hospital campus subject to them signing up to all the other terms and conditions of the new contract.  The salary for consultants who took up this type of contract ranges between €158,997 and €168,226.The above salary ranges exclude on-call and call-out payments.  A more detailed breakdown of all medical consultant salary scales is available in the Consolidated Salary Scales for January 2010, which are available on my Department's website at www.dohc.ie/publications.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1386	I have responsibility for implementing the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year and provides a free preschool year to all children within a certain age range in the year before they commence primary school.The ECCE scheme is a universal scheme which provides for one free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for all children within the qualifying age range.  The scheme takes account of the fact that some children with special needs may benefit from a mainstream preschool setting at a later age than would normally be the case, by allowing an extension of the upper limit of the age range within which children qualify.  In addition, the scheme allows children with special needs to avail of the preschool year on a pro-rata basis over two years, for example for 2 days per week in the first year and then for 3 days per week in the second year.It is recognised that the introduction of the scheme has raised a number of issues in relation to service provision and supports for children with special needs and the need to ensure a coherent approach across both specialist and mainstream settings.  While many children with special needs may require specialist services, others will benefit from attending mainstream services or a mixture of the two.  To achieve these outcomes, earlier this year this Office asked the Office of Disability and Mental Health to set up a Working Group to look at existing services and supports and the allocation of resources for preschool children with special needs.  This Group is expected to report shortly following which the arrangements for children with special needs under the ECCE scheme will be further considered.In the meantime while the scheme as initiated does not provide for any additional provision for children with special needs, pending any arrangements which are put in place following the report of the Working Group, a limited number of children with severe disabilities who had availed of the scheme in the introductory period of January to June 2010 have been approved for re-entry into the scheme in September 2010, the first full year of the scheme, on an exceptional basis in respect of that academic year only.In the case referred to by the Deputy, the information provided to my Office did not confirm a diagnosis of severe disability for the child in question and re-entry to the scheme in September 2010 was not approved.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1389	The purpose of the Economic & Tourism Development Plan for the Shannon catchment area was to present a focused Action Plan to assist the airport and the wider Mid-West region to adapt to new circumstances arising from the EU-US Open Skies Agreement, and the withdrawal of the Shannon Heathrow service by Aer Lingus in 2007.A key component of the Plan is a focused tourism-marketing programme introduced by the Minister for Arts Sports and Tourism to promote the wider Shannon catchment area.  I refer the Deputy to the reply to PQ 32111/10 of today from my colleague Mary Hanafin TD, for an update on the progress to date in the tourism marketing area.Regarding the transport elements of the Plan, significant progress has been made since the report was published in January 2008.  Aer Lingus has reinstated its Shannon Heathrow service and daily connectivity from Shannon to the US has been maintained, despite the ending of the Shannon-stop rule and the dramatic fall in consumer demand for air travel generally.I am of course very conscious that Shannon Airport is going through challenging times in dealing with the downturn in the aviation sector that is having a negative impact on passenger throughput in the airport.  As part of its commercial remit, the Shannon Airport Authority, in conjunction with the Dublin Airport Authority is responsible for addressing this issue.  I have no specific responsibility for this matter but I know that both bodies are very proactive in this regard and that incentives are in place to encourage more traffic to and from the airport.The Economic & Tourism Development Plan also highlighted a number of road investment projects for the region.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, including those listed in the Shannon Economic & Tourism Development Plan, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 and 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Once the major Interurban Routes, which includes the M7 Dublin/Limerick motorway, are completed by the end of 2010, the NRA will focus on the completion of the Atlantic Road Corridor (ARC).  The ARC will run from Letterkenny to Cork and Waterford via Limerick.  The Ennis bypass, completed in early 2008, forms part of this route.  The Crusheen to Gort phase is under construction at present. Further details are available from the NRA.The Western Rail Corridor (Ennis-Athenry) re-opened at the end of March 2010.

One of the recommendations of this review is to refocus the criteria for eligibility for the Scheme from the current position where eligibility depends on specific medical conditions, to a position where the deciding factor is the degree of mobility impairment from which the applicant suffers.Under the current rules people suffering from Alzheimer's disease are not covered by the Scheme.  Under the new rules, people who suffer serious mobility impairments due to their condition will be eligible, and this would, of course, include any Alzheimer's sufferers whose condition involves serious mobility impairment.Work is now under way in my Department to revise the Scheme in the light of the review's recommendations.

Works on those roads and bridges are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.I understand that the estimated cost to replace the bridge over the Tramore River on the Kinsale Road is approximately €1.1 million.  Cork County Council has been provided with a total of €120,672 for this project between 2007 and 2009.  The Council was allocated €950,000 in February 2009 for this project, but this allocation was subsequently reduced following the Supplementary Budget on 7th April 2009.  No funding was sought by the Council for this project in 2010.It is open to Cork County Council to prioritise this project for funding and to include it among its applications for funding in 2011 under the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme, when those applications are submitted in due course to the National Roads Authority.

One such Order (S.I. No. 394 of 2010) has been made to date, which brought Part 1 (Sections 1 and 2) and Sections 26(5), 68 and 78 into operation on 9 August 2010.The remaining sections of the legislation will come into force when the necessary and relevant operational and administrative supports are in place.Part 2 of the 2010 Act consolidates many of the previous intoxicated driving provisions, including sections 9 and 15, which provide for the mandatory testing of drivers in certain circumstances.As the intoxicated driving provisions are inter-related, I intend to commence all those sections together when the new Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) instruments have been procured and are in place.However, I intend to move to amend the existing legislation in order to introduce mandatory testing at the earliest possible date, in advance of the intoxicated driving provisions which await the new EBT instruments. In this regard, I intend, very shortly, to publish the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2010 to facilitate the earliest possible introduction of mandatory testing in certain circumstances.The procurement process for the new EBT instruments, to measure the reduced levels of blood alcohol concentration provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2010, is well advanced. The Medical Bureau for Road Safety (MBRS) will inform me of the overall costs once the preferred supplier has been chosen. It is estimated that the selection, testing and approval of the new instruments, in addition to Garda training and distribution of instruments to Garda Stations will be completed by September 2011.

The cost of the current contracts is €44.8 million over the three year contract period up to July 2011.The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (An Bórd Snip) recommended that the Public Service Obligations for air services should be discontinued after the ending of the present contracts.In addition, under updated EU legislation governing these services, more stringent conditions will apply to future PSO arrangements, having regard for example, to the availability of other transport connections and especially rail services with a travelling time of three hours or less.I have considered the Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the regional airports programme which was recently completed.  The review was carried out to assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in future years bearing in mind aviation policy objectives, the updated EU legislation, the improved surface links under the NDP and Transport 21 and the need to address the difficulties with our public finances.The Review is being considered by Government and it is intended that it will be published shortly.

The Government is committed to the development of such a system under the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012.There is no one internationally accepted standard for a GDL system, which may contain many of a variety of different elements.  The RSA examined the matter in considerable depth and has developed and published nine proposals.  Earlier this year I approved these proposals in principle, and the RSA is now working to develop them in greater detail.Many of the elements of the system will require primary legislation, and work in this regard is underway.  It is my intention to introduce a Bill  during 2011.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1405	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.
On 22nd February 2010, I announced a total of €411,408,500 for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2010.  From this allocation, Kildare County Council is being provided with €12,922,893.In deciding on allocations for 2010 my priority was to protect the existing network along with the massive investment in it over the last number of years and to carefully target resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the severe weather earlier in the year.My Department received an application from Kildare County Council in November 2008 for 100% funding of the Athy Southern Distributor Road at an estimated cost of €42 million.  In order to increase the monies available for the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements, it has been necessary to reduce the grant allocations for major new road schemes and for major realignment schemes.  As a result of this, no funding is being provided for this project in 2010.

Since then, initiatives such as Workplace Travel Planning, the Green Schools Programme, new cycle routes and Dublin City Council's Dublinbikes Scheme have encouraged and supported cycling.  Next year Census 2011 will provide a figure for cycling numbers and mode share, and I would expect to see an increase relative to 2006.

At the same time I also wish to encourage greater use of public transport, as being a more environmentally sustainable mode of transport than the private car.  Bus lanes have been put in place at public expense for the particular purpose of giving priority on our roads to public transport, particularly in congested urban areas.  I have no plans to extend access to bus lanes to include electric vehicles.

In these cases, low traffic speeds allow a sense of place to be prioritised over movement. In this context, I am aware of recent discussions at Dublin City Council's Transportation and Traffic Strategic Policy Committee on Environmental Traffic Cells and Home Zones.The importance of street design in supporting and encouraging sustainable travel patterns in urban areas is recognised in the Smarter Travel policy under the theme of aligning spatial planning and transport.It is worth noting that a national urban design guidance document (Irish Manual for Streets) is currently being drafted and will be jointly issued by the Department of Transport and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Manual will outline practical design measures to support and encourage more sustainable travel patterns in urban areas including residential areas. Design issues under consideration for the Manual include appropriate design speeds. The broader issue of shared space will also be considered in the Manual.Responsibility for setting speed limits rests with local authorities.

A progressive approach is being adopted to permit the ITS Project Team and transport operators undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved and to allow customers to familiarize themselves with using the new system. The project is now firmly in the implementation phase with extensive testing of elements of the system well underway. The system must be thoroughly tested to ensure that the scheme provided to customers is stable, safe and reliable.Intensive pilot testing of an integrated smartcard for the Dublin Bus/Luas Annual Pass by staff is currently underway, to be followed in October 2010 with a live customer pilot. This will be followed by similar testing for ePurse (pay-as-you-go) users of Dublin Bus and Luas services.

Therefore, the restriction on working hours contained in this legislation does not apply to the vast majority of taxi drivers.Under Road Traffic (Public Services Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended most recently by 1998 Regulations (S.I. No. 295 of 1998), applicants for a small public service vehicle licence  must give an undertaking in writing that, if the licence is granted, the applicant shall not drive a public service vehicle for more than eleven hours in any one day in any period of three consecutive days.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1420	The most recent analysis of medium to long term traffic volumes at our ports was conducted as part of the Dublin Port National Development Plan Study, which my Department published in August last year.While taking account of the economic downturn, the Study concluded that the ports sector would face renewed capacity constraints from approximately 2025 onwards. It concluded that these capacity constraints will be such that the development of a significant additional capacity project, in addition to other smaller scale projects, will be required to serve the needs of the Greater Dublin Area.The consultants who carried out the study met with, and received submissions from, a number of private sector service providers within the industry.The commercial ports sector is characterised by a high degree of private sector involvement and investment. Port companies increasingly rely on private sources of financing, particularly since Exchequer and EU funding is no longer available.The Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009 introduced greater commercial flexibility for the port companies in regard to borrowing and investment. These measures are aimed at assisting ports in maximising private sector investment in their future development.I recently announced a review of national ports policy and a public consultation period in respect of that review is currently underway.The review will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to shape future ports policy. The consultation document published on my Department's website addresses many issues, including port capacity and private sector investment, and seeks the views of interested parties on how these issues might be addressed in the future.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1423	I have been informed by officials of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the EU Commission published a proposal for a Directive Providing for Sanctions Against Employers of Illegally Staying Third Country Nationals in May 2007.  The Directive was finally adopted by the European Council in June 2009.Following the publication of the proposal neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom exercised their option, provided for in Article 3 of the Protocol on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community, to notify the President of the Council that they wished to take part in the adoption and application of the proposal within three months.  It is a stated Government policy that Ireland will only participate in such measures to the extent compatible with the Common Travel Area.  Any unilateral decision by either of the partners (UK or Ireland) would have had obvious implications as regards the ongoing maintenance of the Common Travel Area as regards participating in the proposal.As a general rule, officials of my Department keep under review Ireland's position as regards all measures adopted under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Formally Title IV of the Treaty on the European Union) in line with emerging Government priorities and policies as necessary.I have also been advised by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Innovation, who has primary policy responsibility, that in relation to contracts which might be regarded as illegal by the Irish Courts, that the Irish Courts have taken the view that it would be contrary to public policy to enforce such contracts. A contract of employment between a third country migrant worker required to have a work permit and an employer, which is not covered by a valid work permit, is an illegal contract. Accordingly, the National Employment Rights Authority does not seek to recover money due to people working under illegal contracts.

These requirements are assessed having regard to a number of criteria, including emissions, fuel efficiency and overall cost.The operation and provision of Office Holder transport will continue to be reviewed in the context of these criteria.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1425	I am informed by Garda authorities that the location referred to is within Clontarf Garda Sub-District.  Local Garda management is aware of previous instances of anti-social behaviour in the area, including at the location referred to.  I am further informed that local Garda management is not currently in receipt of any complaints relating to the location.  Any such complaints reported to An Garda Síochána will be subject to investigation.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

Although currently vacant, a full time post is assigned to this unit from the HSE.It was agreed with the Garda Central  Vetting Unit (GCVU) based in Thurles, Co. Tipperary, that RIA would act as the central conduit for all communications between the GVCU and RIA accommodation centres, of which there are 47 different centres with 24 different contractors.  All RIA contractors and their designated contact person have been vetted.  RIA's largest contractor, Bridgestock Ltd., carried out a successful pilot vetting programme for its staff, all of whom have now been vetted.  This formed the basis of a training programme, finishing in March of this year, for all other contractors and their designated contact persons all of whom have now been trained in the Garda Vetting procedure.  This, in turn, is facilitating the  vetting of all staff employed in centres contracted to RIA.  This process is ongoing and it is expected that all staff will be vetted within the next few months. Contractors are required to submit Garda Vetting Forms for all newly appointed staff members.In addition to the above, RIA has a Child Protection Policy for Accommodation Centres which was developed in collaboration with the Health Services Executive and in line with the Children First Guidelines and was launched in late 2005.  Its principal aim is the minimisation of risk to children and vulnerable adults residing in RIA accommodation centres. This policy defines the various types of child abuse, and outlines procedures to follow in the event of suspected child abuse.  Management of accommodation centres are obliged to ensure that all staff working in the centre are aware of and adhere to the Child Protection Guidelines.  In addition, the HSE have provided ‘Keeping Safe' child protection training to designated officers and other staff members in accommodation and reception centres.All new residents, when they first arrive at their accommodation centre, receive a booklet which explains the centres services, rules and procedures which incorporates the child protection policy. Visual "storyboard" tools have also been developed to facilitate the raising of awareness amongst residents of the RIA's child protection policy.  These tools are now available to direct provision centre staff and other service providers.

His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.   He was notified of this determination by letter dated 31 October 2002.The person concerned applied for permission to remain in the State on the basis of being the parent of an Irish citizen child, born before 1st January 2005, in accordance with the revised arrangements announced by the then Minister on 15 January 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  The person concerned did not satisfy the Scheme's criteria so his application was refused and he was notified of this decision by letter dated 16 November, 2005.In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 25 June 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

Figures for 2009 and up until the 12 September 2010 are set out in the table below. It is important to note that many of these seizures occur at point of entry to the prisons and do not enter the prison system. I have asked Irish Prison Service to consider how reporting systems can be modified to differentiate between seizures within the prison and at point of entry to the prison.Prisons do not have the facilities to test the type or quantity of substances found. Gardaí are contacted once suspected drug seizures are made and issues for investigation and prosecution fall within their remit.Prison/Place of DetentionNumber of Drug Seizures in 2009Number of Drug Seizures in 2010 (up to 12/9/2010)Arbour Hill Prison00Castlerea Prison6554Cloverhill Prison9754Cork Prison3533Dóchas Centre1114Limerick Prison75119Loughan House1228Midlands Prison9360Mountjoy Prison (male)547527Portlaoise Prison2027Shelton Abbey1920St. Patrick’s Institution92137Training Unit6037Wheatfield Prison16769Total1,2931,179A number of new security initiatives have been introduced in all closed prisons including: The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons; The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams; The establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas; and the Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) chair was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in early 2008 and to date eight chairs have been installed.The new security screening at prison entrances and the range of measures introduced have had considerable success in preventing the flow of and assisting in the capture of contraband such as illicit drugs. I am determined to take all reasonable measures to ensure that we stem the flow of illicit substances into our prisons.In tandem with the emphasis on enhanced security measures, the Irish Prison Service continues to implement its Drug Policy and Strategy.  Part of the implementation of the Strategy includes continued significant investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population through meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs. For example, we have recently renewed the contract for the provision of Addiction Counsellor Services with Merchants Quay Ireland providing an average of 1500 prisoner contacts per month.

The Scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict. Under this element of the Scheme payments were made to Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members.  During the period of operation of the Scheme Justice for the Forgotten received a total of €1.2m of the €1.5m allocated for victim support services and was the only recipient of money under this heading. In addition the organisation had received over €890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach in the period 2000-2003.The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission came to an end on 31 October 2008 and funding under the Scheme ended at that stage. Nevertheless, I took a decision at that time to grant further funding to Justice for the Forgotten totalling €190,300 to enable them to continue to operate while seeking to put alternative funding options in place.As I have made clear, my first priority is to ensure that those victims who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for.  I have made special arrangements to have these costs provided by my Department through the Victims of Crime Office.

From that date, any instrument purporting to create a fee farm grant, or to grant a lease for life or lives renewable for ever or for any period which is perpetually renewable, vests in the purported grantee or lessee a legal or equitable fee simple.With regard to ground rents, section 2 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1978 prohibited the creation of leases reserving ground rents on residential dwelling houses after the passing of the Act. As regards ground rents already in existence at that time, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby any individual may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling house.  The scheme is operated by the Property Registration Authority.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which allow individuals, on application to the Circuit Court, to acquire the fee simple in certain properties other than dwelling houses subject to the provisions of that Act.

As the Deputy is aware, the DPP is independent in the performance of his functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.The alleged breach of a court order is a matter which can be addressed only through the courts.  The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment further.

If they separate, custody is normally with the parent with whom the child is intended to reside.  The law makes no distinction between the access rights of the married mother and father.Where a child is born outside marriage the mother is the sole automatic guardian.  An unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, appointing the father as a guardian of his child, without having to go to court.Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act provides that the guardian of a child or the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including orders on custody and access. In making such orders and, in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In addition, the law places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her father and mother: Section 11D of the 1964 Act (inserted by the Children Act 1997) obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.These legislative provisions are comprehensive.  They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.As part of its Third Programme of Law Reform 2008-2014, the Law Reform Commission published in September 2009 a consultation paper ‘Legal Aspects of Family Relationships', in which it makes provisional recommendations on the rights and duties of parents in relation to guardianship, custody and access to their children.  The Commission invited submissions on its provisional recommendations as part of the consultation process.  The Commission's final report and recommendations, expected to be published later this year, will help to inform debate on the issues in advance of the formulation of any proposals for reform of the law in this area.

As I have already informed the House previously the vast majority of females who entered or were placed in Magdalen Laundries did so without any direct involvement of the State.  My Department's research indicates that a small proportion of entrants to Magdalen Laundries came through the criminal justice system — women offenders under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 or a suspended sentence.  In addition one institution was used for a period as a remand centre for young women charged with criminal offences.  The detail of the role of the criminal justice system, including the limited records held by my Department and the National Archives, are set out in my reply to her Party Leader on 13 May, 2010 and that remains the position.My Department has met with representatives of Justice for the Magdalenes, has exchanged views and offered every assistance possible to allow access to the limited available records in the normal way.  However there are no plans to introduce a State funded redress scheme.  I remain open to considering any further assistance by, for example, the continued sharing of records that might be provided to the many elderly survivors and/or the families of people who were in these institutions.

I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, due to the fact that an official car was temporarily out of service at Mountjoy Garda Station, it was necessary to use a rental vehicle to ensure optimum delivery of service to the community.I understand from the Garda authorities that this was an exceptional situation and they have indicated that they are satisfied that the Garda transport allocated to the station is sufficient to meet the needs of the area concerned.

At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process. However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis.

The application procedure for the age card is governed by section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, and by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (Age Card) Regulations 2007. Applications are made, on the designated form, to the Garda station in the area in which the applicant resides.  The application form must be accompanied by the applicant's birth certificate, at least one other document confirming identity, one recent passport sized photograph and the prescribed fee of €10.  The required identification and photo are authenticated by a Garda and forwarded to the company which produces the cards on behalf of An Garda Síochána.  The applicant is provided with a receipt which contains a form reference number, which allows the applicant to track the progress of the application on-line at www.agecard.ie.  The company produces the card and posts it to the applicant at the address provided on the application form.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the length of time to process an application is between 6 to 8 weeks and that there is currently no backlog of applications.  I am also informed that, following a tender process, the Garda authorities will introduce an on-line application process and engage a new card supplier from the beginning of 2011.

As I have previously stated, the processing of applications for Subsidiary Protection is resource intensive and, as a result, the number of such applications on hands at present is quite sizeable.  However, I understand that additional staff members have been, and are being, deployed to work in this area with a view to having such applications processed in a more timely manner.  These efforts will continue until all such applications are being processed on a current basis.

To date there have been two major rounds of this Scheme, in 2005 and 2007.  Under the 2007 round of the Scheme, a grant of €99,893 was awarded by my Department to the town referred to by the Deputy, for the installation of cameras at 14 locations.  Matching funding was also provided by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs bringing the total award to almost €200,000.I am advised by Pobal, who administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department, that the installation of these cameras is expected to commence shortly, following the completion of preparatory works.  I am further advised that the specific locations referred to by the Deputy did not form part of the original application for funding and, consequently, do not form part of this project.  Any future plans for an extension of CCTV are dependent on a number of factors, including the progression of the schemes already grant aided, the availability of funding and overall policy considerations.  A Garda Town Centre CCTV system is also operational in the town.

In accordance with the legislation I make decisions on naturalisation applications based on all of the information available to me.  I have adopted a general policy that I will normally require an applicant for naturalisation, unless he/she is a refugee, programme refugee or Stateless person, to show that he/she has supported him or herself (and his or her family if appropriate) while residing in the State and, as far as can be determined, is in a position to continue that support into the future.  I am, generally speaking, satisfied to accept that an applicant is self supporting if he or she has not availed of State support in the 3 year period prior to the date of application or subsequently has satisfied officials that they have supported themselves independently for that period.  Certification fees for Citizenship were last changed in August 2008.  While the fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing the different categories of applicant, the current certification fees do not recoup the full cost of processing in any category.  Certificates of naturalisation can only be issued on payment of the prescribed fee at the time of certification.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1455	Prior to 1 January 2004, the Extradition Act 1965 governed extradition arrangements between Ireland and other countries. Part II of the Act deals with extradition matters between Ireland and countries other than the United Kingdom.  The European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which became law on 1 January 2004, gives effect to the European Union Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States.  It puts in place simplified procedures for the surrender of persons between the Member States of the EU.  Under the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, a court may, upon application made by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, issue a European Arrest Warrant in respect of a person where it is satisfied, inter alia, that a domestic warrant has been issued for the arrest of that person but has not been executed and the person may not be in the State.  As the Deputy will appreciate, both the courts and the DPP are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as Minister for Justice and Law Reform, I have no function in the making of such an application.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1456	My primary responsibility as Minister for Justice and Law Reform is to uphold the integrity of the criminal justice system.  However, I agree that it is in the interests of society and of offenders if we can promote their rehabilitation and integration into society.  Securing employment is, I agree, one of the most effective ways of achieving those objectives.  I therefore support the removal of inappropriate barriers  that stand in the way of an offender who wishes to make a fresh start.  The Deputy will be aware of the Spent Convictions Bill 2007 currently on the Dáil Order Paper.  The recommendations by the Law Reform Commission to which the Deputy refers are being given effect by that Bill.  The Bill was introduced initially as a Private Members Bill by my colleague, Mr Barry Andrews, TD, Minister for Children and it is now awaiting Committee Stage, having completed Second Stage in December 2008.  Minister Andrews and I hope to be in a position to make arrangements for Committee Stage quite soon.In line with the Commission's Report, the Bill provides for circumstances where a person is entitled to withhold details of certain convictions. It is important to emphasise that it is a non — disclosure regime, rather that one of removing the conviction from the person's criminal record.  The Bill is directed at offences committed by persons over 18 years and it will have retrospective effect.  As regards those under 18 years, I draw the Deputy's attention to section 258 of the Children Act 2001.  It already provides for non — disclosure in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18, once certain conditions have been met.  That section came into operation on 1 May 2002.  Its effect is that, where the relevant conditions have been met, the person is to be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty of or dealt with for an offence and the person may, except as provided for in the section, withhold information about the offence and the circumstances relating to it.

Local Garda management is aware of incidents of anti-social behaviour at the location and is discussing the matter with Dublin Bus.  The area is patrolled by Garda foot and mobile patrols with additional support from the Divisional Crime Task Force and the Divisional Traffic Unit as appropriate.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences, including the prevention of crimes of violence against persons and property.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

The most recent contract for the provision of Office Holder cars, in 2007/2008, specified diesel-powered vehicles.  In addition, there are a number of hybrid (petrol/electric) vehicles in the fleet.  There are no set rules as to when Office Holder cars are replaced and in general cars are replaced when, due to age, condition and/or mileage, they are considered no longer economic to maintain.

I can assure the Deputy that the staffing of the constituency offices as outlined above adheres to guidelines set down by the Department of Finance.  Staff in constituency offices are entitled to travel and subsistence expenses in accordance with relevant Department of Finance Circulars.  However, these staff are office-based and travel expenses rarely arise.  The accommodation costs of Ministerial constituency offices in the Department's Head Offices in Dublin are subsumed in the Department's overall accommodation costs, which are met by the Office of Public Works.

All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.  The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

Immigration and naturalisation policies and systems vary from country to country and are therefore not directly comparable.  In any event, I have no information at my disposal which would enable such a comparison to be made. Statutory provisions for the acquisition of Irish citizenship are contained in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  A review of the current framework for the acquisition of Irish citizenship is underway in my Department and will consider a wide range of issues relating to the current statutory framework as well as other administrative arrangements in the granting of citizenship and I will be publishing a consultation document in this regard in due course.

The person in question was informed of this decision and the reasons for it in a letter issued to the first named person on 15 September, 2010.  Applications for certificates of naturalisation on behalf of the second and third named persons referred to in the Deputy's Question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2009 and I decided in my absolute discretion not to grant certificates of naturalisation.  The parent of the persons concerned was informed of this decision and the reasons for it in letters issued on 22 October, 2009.There is no appeals process under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  It is open to the persons in question to lodge new applications for certificates of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements.  However, in doing so they should bear in mind the reasons for refusal of their previous applications.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

In accordance with the provisions of the contract, following the necessary preparatory work, rollout of the national safety camera network is scheduled to commence in the coming weeks and will increase to full capacity in early 2011.  An Garda Síochána will determine the scheduling of the speed monitoring and survey sessions, with a Garda Superintendent overseeing the day-to-day running of the project.  The selected supplier will have responsibility for ensuring monitoring and survey sessions are conducted in accordance with the schedules and providing survey and monitoring data to An Garda Síochána.  The selected supplier will provide the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operating personnel.  An Garda Síochána will issue fixed charge notices to speeding drivers who are detected and pursue any court prosecutions undertaken.  The service provider will be paid according to the level of service provided.  The number of speeding drivers detected by the service provider will have no effect on the level of payment made.  The purpose of the contract is to reduce speed, and so increase road safety, not to generate revenue either for the State or the service provider.

The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy & Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prison, which was launched in May  2006 using a number of stands. Firstly, through the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons; and secondly, by  continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting  prisoners' treatment  and rehabilitative needs.  Of particular significance is that now any person entering prison giving a history of opiate use and testing  positive  for  opioids is offered a medically assisted symptomatic detoxification if clinically indicated. Patientscan, as part of the assessment process, discuss with healthcare staff other treatment options.  These may include stabilization on methadone maintenance for persons who wish to continue on maintenance while in prison and when they return to the community on release.  Prisoners who on committal are engaged in a methadone substitution  programme  in  the  community  will  in  the  main have their methadone substitution treatment continued while in custody.  As the Deputy may be aware methadone substitution treatment is available in 8 out of the 14 prisons (accommodating over 75% of the prison population) in the prison estate.  The table below shows the number of patients who received opiate substitution treatment with methadone during August 2010 which includes detox, maintenance and stabilisation.PrisonsTotal patients during August 2010Cloverhill Prison172Dochas Centre65Limerick Prison26Midlands Prison68Mountjoy Prison249Portlaoise Prison24St Patrick’s Institution1Wheatfield Prison98TOTALS703

Educational services are now available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community, notably the Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  The Department of Education and Skills provide an allocation of whole-time teacher equivalents to the prisons through the VECs (220 in the academic year 2010/11).  This enables education to be offered in all prisons including provision for the summer months and also special teaching arrangements where prisoners are segregated.

A number of our prisons have significant numbers of what would be regarded as protection prisoners accommodated on separate landings who have access to a wide regime of activities including school, workshops, gym facilities, probation service and chaplaincy service.  However, there are a cohort of protection prisoners who are subject to a more restricted regime.  The majority of these prisoners are located in our older prisons which because of constraints on space, resources, staffing levels and the simple number of factions which have to be kept separate from each other, are not in a position to offer enhanced regimes to these prisoners.  The numbers requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table as of 23 September 2010Prison/Place of DetentionNumber of Prisoners on 23 hour lock upArbour Hill Prison0Castlerea Prison23Cloverhill Prison1Cork Prison14Dóchas Centre0Limerick Prison6Loughan House0Midlands Prison26Mountjoy Prison (male)153Portlaoise Prison0Shelton Abbey0St. Patrick’s Institution40Training Unit0Wheatfield Prison45Total308This cohort of prisoner subject to 23 hour protection do not have access to normal educational services.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to reduce the numbers of protection prisoners who fall into this category and regular transfers take place to other institutions where a prisoner will not require protection.  In addition, the recently refurbished Separation Unit in Mountjoy Prison has now opened and provides 50 spaces with in-cell sanitation and secure exercise yards for this category of prisoner.  The Unit provides enhanced accommodation for prisoners including in -cell sanitation and prisoners have access to a range of services including medical, gym facilities, probation service and chaplaincy service.

In relation to the number of those people who have served a prison sentence in this State, such details are not recorded in my Department in a manner as would enable me to readily provide the Deputy with the requested information.  The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction and compilation of such information would require my officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to examine all 228 files and I could not justify the deflection of such officials from their day to day work to assemble this information.  The Deputy should note, however, that my Department is in ongoing liaison with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Prison Service to ensure that, wherever possible, the cases of non-EEA national persons in detention are processed to completion in advance of their release date so that they are deported at the time of their release rather than being permitted to re-join the general population.In relation to the treatment of Chinese deportees by the Chinese authorities, this is entirely a matter for the Chinese authorities and clearly neither I nor my Department would have access to such information.  However, the Deputy should note that before a decision to deport is made, detailed consideration must be given to the safety of returning that person to their country of origin, a consideration known as the ‘refoulement' consideration which is provided for under Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).  This consideration involves conducting objective, up to date research into the prevailing political and human rights situations in the relevant country of origin and such a consideration would equally be carried out in advance of any deportation decision being made in the context of a Chinese national.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time. Such representations would sometimes be referred to as a ‘leave to remain application'.The position in the State of the person concerned now falls to be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

A person so appointed holds the office on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Minister at the time of the appointment. Section 3(6) of the said Act, provides that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform may revoke an appointment made or deemed to have been made under the said section.  In addition, Section 3(4) of the Immigration Act 2004 provides that a person appointed by the Minister to be an immigration officer, before the commencement of the Act of 2004 and who was acting as such an officer immediately before such commencement, shall upon such commencement be deemed to have been appointed as an immigration officer under the section.The majority of persons appointed as Immigration Officers are Members of An Garda Síochána (indeed, all Immigration Officers at ports of entry are members of An Garda Síochána). A number of officials in my Department who are working in the immigration area are also appointed as immigration officers for the purposes of carrying out their duties. In this regard, it is of course the case that the appropriate process and practices apply to recruitment as members of An Garda Síochána or civil servants.  Therefore, the question of the code of practice of the Commission of Public Service Appointments does not arise in this particular process.In the event that a member of An Garda Síochána who is an immigration officer, travels outside the State for the purpose of interacting with the law enforcement authorities operating in Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction, he/she will not utilise powers conferred on an immigration officer by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform as they relate only to the control of non-nationals entering, residing or leaving this State.  Members of An Garda Síochána who have been appointed as immigration officers will have received training provided to all such members.  Also, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) provides additional immigration specific in-service training, to immigration officers.In the time available it has not been possible to compile the detailed statistics requested in relation to the period referred to by the Deputy.  However, I can inform the Deputy that the total number of members of An Garda Síochána who are currently immigration officers or in respect of whom such appointment under the Immigration Act, 2004 is imminent is 411 and there have been 100 officials appointed as immigration officers under the Act of 2004.

This requirement was introduced on an administrative basis and has been in place for a considerable time.  Students who do not meet the required attendance level may be denied further registration as a student with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  I can confirm that the immigration authorities do take into account any exceptional circumstances which may prevent a student from attaining the required attendance.  Such exceptional circumstances would include serious illness.

Local Garda management is aware of a number of incidents of the type referred to by the Deputy in the area referred to.  Investigations into these incidents are ongoing, and one arrest has been made to date.  A community Garda has been designated for the area and has met a number of residents.  The community Garda has called to the homes of the victims and offered crime prevention advice and information.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  Liquor licence inspections have been increased in the area.  Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

It is further the case that the position as stated in my replies to Parliamentary Questions 93 of 3 June 2010, 237 of 13 October 2009 and 122 of 5 March 2009 remains unchanged.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1490	A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee.  In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy made two Family Reunification applications which were received in May 2009 and August 2009 respectively.  The applications were forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  This investigations were completed and the Commissioner has forwarded reports to INIS.  The applications will be considered by INIS and a decision on both will issue in due course.  Applications for Family Reunification are currently taking approximately 18 months to process.

In May 2008 she lodged an application for residency in the State based on parentage of an Irish citizen child but as there was no stand alone measure for the consideration of such applications in place at that time, her application was rejected and she was notified in writing to this effect in June 2008.  Given that she had no legal basis to remain in the State, the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 24 June 2008, of the proposal to make a Deportation Order against her, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  She was advised of the options open to her as a result which included the facility to submit, within a period of 15 working days, written representations setting out reasons why she should not be deported.  She was also notified of her entitlement to make an application for Subsidiary Protection.  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and, following consideration of this application, a decision was made to refuse that application.  This decision was conveyed to the person concerned by letter dated 28 May 2009.The case of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, was then considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement before a Deportation Order was made in respect of her on 11 June 2009.  This Order was served by registered post dated 3 July 2009.  On 15 July 2009, the person concerned lodged judicial review proceedings in the High Court challenging the decision to make a Deportation Order against her.  As these proceedings are ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the case at this time.

The Refugee Applications Commissioner refused her a declaration of refugee status.  This decision was subsequently upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  On 29 June 2010 it was determined that she was not eligible for subsidiary protection.  A Deportation Order was made in respect of her on 13 July 2010.  The person concerned instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 11 August 2010 challenging the Deportation Order made in respect of her and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.

Based on this recommendation, the person concerned was issued with a formal declaration of refugee status by letter dated 24/6/2005. This communication also advised the person concerned of the rights and entitlements accompanying refugee status in the State. The person concerned continues to hold the status of refugee in the State.A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, because of the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration/Asylum cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The mother applied for asylum on 3 April 2006.  She gave birth to the second person referred to and this child was included as a child dependant in her mother's application for asylum.  The father applied for asylum on 3 December 2007 while a separate asylum application was lodged in respect of the fourth person referred to, an infant, on 20 January 2009. The fifth person referred to is the couple's youngest child.The asylum applications made by the first, third and fourth persons referred to were refused and, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), they were notified, by letters dated 26 August 2010, 10 September 2008 and 28 July 2010 respectively, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of each of them.

This Order was served by registered post dated 11 August 2005. This communication advised the person concerned of the legal requirement that she ‘present' herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 18 August, 2005, in order to make arrangements for her deportation from the State.  The person concerned ‘presented' on this occasion but failed to ‘present' on a subsequent occasion and was therefore classified as a person evading deportation.The person concerned subsequently sought to make an application for Subsidiary Protection, based on the provisions of Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. However, while that Regulation suggested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might have discretion to permit a person who is the subject of a Deportation Order to make an application for Subsidiary Protection, the Supreme Court, in adjudicating in a case not connected with the case of the person concerned, ruled that the Minister did not have such discretion. As a result of that ruling, an application for Subsidiary Protection cannot be accepted from a person who is the subject of a Deportation Order. This being the case, the application for Subsidiary Protection submitted by the person concerned cannot be considered. She therefore remains the subject of a valid Deportation Order, the consequence of which is that she is legally obliged to leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned is the subject of a Family Reunification application made in May 2010. The application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. This investigation is completed and the Commissioner forwarded a report to INIS on the 30 July, 2010. This application will be considered by INIS and a decision will issue in due course. Applications for Family Reunification are currently taking approximately 18 months to process.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Therefore to establish the number of reported cases of internet fraud would involve a manual search of Garda records and would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources.An Garda Síochána are proactive in preventing this type of crime by actively raising awareness of public fraud prevention measures through a number of forums.  The Gardaí in conjunction with the Irish Banking Federation, the Irish Payment Services Organisation, the retail banks and the UCD Centre for Cybercrime Investigation work on the reduction of this type of crime as part of the remit of the Irish Banking Federation Hi-Tech Crime Forum.  This group has published public awareness leaflets and have undertaken many media campaigns in an effort to reduce Internet Fraud.  The Gardaí and Price Waterhouse Coopers have also published the Fraud Alert book to spread awareness with the public and businesses community in relation to Internet Fraud.  On the more general question of cybercrime, I can inform the House that I am proceeding with proposals for the preparation of a Criminal Justice (Cybercrime) Bill.

Within these rules there is provision for prisoners to earn remission at the rate of 25% of their sentences by virtue of good conduct (Rule 59(1)).  In exceptional circumstances, and where a prisoner has demonstrated a particular commitment to rehabilitation, a rate of 33% may be earned (Rule 59(2)). However this rate of remission has only been granted once since the coming into effect of the Rules in 2007.  The Lisbon Treaty does not address the issue of early prisoner release or greater credit for good behaviour.

That number includes approximately 17,000 work permit holders, 32,000 students, 10,000 persons granted refugee status, 3,700 persons granted leave to remain and 72,000 persons with other categories of status.  It should be noted that these figures cannot be taken as a precise measure of the numbers of non-EEA persons in these categories who were actually present in the State at the end of 2009, as persons who are currently registered may have left the State.  Approximately 11,500 persons were granted citizenship between the years 2005 and 2009.The information requested by the Deputy in respect of "persons being processed" is not readily available.  Persons in this category would be included in asylum, subsidiary protection, leave to remain, Long Term Residence, EU Treaty Rights, etc caseloads, some of which cases can relate to more than one person.

The person concerned was informed of the decision to refuse her application and the basis for this decision by letter of 6 September, 2010.  A request by the applicant and her spouse for a Review of this decision was received on 22 September, 2010.  All applications for Review are dealt with in chronological order of date of receipt of the application for Review.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1634	The Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 provides for establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority. While the primary functions of the Authority will include operation of a licensing system for property services providers and the investigation of complaints arising from the provision of property services by such providers, the legislation also gives the Authority a role in promoting consumer protection and protecting the best interests of users and potential users of property services.In the Renewed Programme for Government agreed last year, the Government recognises that the lack of transparency in the property market, including the lack of reliable sales prices in the case of residential property and accurate information on market rents and other terms, including rent review clauses, in the case of commercial leases, is an impediment to consumer protection and needs to be tackled. I intend, therefore, to bring forward amendments to the Property Services (Regulation) Bill in due course to give the new Authority the statutory function of publishing details of both residential sales prices and commercial leases, including rent review clauses.  In order to be useful, this data must be both reliable and up-to-date. For this reason, it is intended that details which, under existing stamp duty legislation, must be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes within 30 days following the sale or lease of property will be made available to the Property Services Regulatory Authority for publication. Publication will ensure the required level of market transparency and meet the needs of statutory and other bodies involved in tracking market trends and compiling statistical data on the property market.The primary purpose of the Property Registration Authority is to promote and extend the registration of ownership of land and I am pleased that the Authority has made very significant progress in this area since its establishment in 2006. As regards the availability of price data, I understand that while it had been the practice to publish details of prices when a sale or lease transaction was entered in the Land Register, that practice was discontinued many years ago. Moreover, while the registration of leases of over 21 years is compulsory in all counties except Dublin and Cork, commercial leases are normally of much shorter duration. The Property Registration Authority would not therefore be in a position to supply useful data in respect of the commercial property market.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1635	As the Deputy may be aware, the Explosives Act, 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks.  The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect in August, 2006 to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  The amendments also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  Under the provisions, it is an offencefor any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licenceto throw an ignited firework at any person or property, andto light unlicensed fireworks in  a public placeThe penalty for such offences is now a fine of up to €10,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both.A nationwide information campaign will take place in the run up to Hallowe'en using national and regional newspapers to highlight to the public the dangers of fireworks and the significant penalties that exist for their illegal use.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Tombola, the annual Garda operation, is in place for policing during the Hallowe'en period. I understand that Operational Orders have been put in place in every Garda Region, in particular in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and Border Divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation of fireworks in the lead up to Hallowe'en and to police the Hallowe'en period.  Persons suspected of engaging in the importation, supply or sale of fireworks will be identified and targeted.An Garda Síochána is also engaging with local communities, Local Authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus, in putting plans in place to address the issues that arise around the Hallowe'en period.  Through the Schools Programme and other local programmes members of An Garda Síochána will highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks.  Gardaí have a liaison mechanism in place with Local Authorities for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials, in advance of Hallowe'en night.  Gardaí have also advised Managers of Off-Licences to ensure that staff are appraised of their obligations and responsibilities under Licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to underage persons.I am also informed that proactive policing arrangements are in place covering the period coming up to and including Hallowe'en night and the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will be rigidly enforced.  Additional patrols will be carried out by uniform personnel as part of high-visibility policing initiatives supported by plain-clothes personnel, including District Detective and Drug Units, Divisional Crime Task Force, Traffic Corps personnel and Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units.  Given the offences and increased penalties that now exist, together with the measures outlined above, I expect that the Garda operations will continue to be successful in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.

From time to time, liaison of a technical nature does, however, take place between officials of my Department and those in the UK and elsewhere.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1637	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1141 and 1142 together.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the report titled ‘Setting the Record: The trafficking of migrant women in the England and Wales off-street prostitution sector' which was published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in August 2010, is being examined by An Garda Síochána to establish its relevance, if any, to the investigation of human trafficking to this jurisdiction.It should be noted that the Report is a prevalence study of human trafficking in off street prostitution.  It provides an estimate of the number of women who are trafficked in England and Wales and who are working in indoor prostitution.  It does not state that the police in the UK have personally identified 2,600 as victims of trafficking but rather that this is the number estimated to exist.  Figures published by the UK Human Trafficking Centre show that between April 2009 and March 2010, a total of 706 referrals were made to the competent authorities in the UK. Of these, 361 persons were identified as having reasonable grounds for accepting that they were trafficked. There were conclusive grounds decisions for believing 122 of these persons were trafficked. The UK Human Trafficking Centre figures provide a more meaningful comparison with the Irish statistics for human trafficking.The Deputy's figure of six victims identified in 2009 as victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation does not reflect the actual situation. Sixty six individuals were alleged to be potential victims of human trafficking in 2009. Of these, eleven (including six suspected victims of sexual exploitation) required an immigration permission under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking pending an examination of their claim. The remainder already had existing permissions to remain in the State based on their application for asylum pursuant to the Refugee Act, 1996 or on other forms of residence permissions and the Administrative Immigration Arrangements did not apply to them.I do not share the view that Government policy is failing trafficked women and girls. Dedicated units have been established in my Department, An Garda Síochána, the Legal Aid Board and the Health Service Executive to address  various aspects of human trafficking. Personnel attached to a range of State agencies and service providers, have received training in recognising the indicators of human trafficking. An initiative to train the Training Officers in these State agencies was developed by the International Organisation for Migration and the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit of my Department using a "Train the Trainer" model to further expand the awareness of human trafficking amongst front line service providers in State agencies.To ensure a proactive approach to crimes associated with human trafficking, about 400 members of An Garda Síochána have been provided with advanced training relating to human trafficking.   There has been an input from the UK Human Trafficking Centre at all such courses. In the region of an additional 2500  members of An Garda Síochána have been provided with basic human trafficking related awareness raising training.  Training on the investigation of human trafficking related crimes, including victim identification, was also provided recently to all Senior Investigating Officers.Targeting human trafficking is one of the goals of An Garda Síochána set out in its Annual Policing Plan for 2010 and is a particular priority for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  An Garda Síochána has been assigned a specific role in the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland 2009-2012.  The NRM provides that all individuals encountered by, or referred to, An Garda Síochána, are provided with legal advice, medical assistance, accommodation and crime prevention advice.  If the individual does not already have permission to be in the State and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under section 2, 3 or 4 of the Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008 has been committed, a superintendent of An Garda Síochána attached to GNIB, may identify the person as a “suspected victim” of human trafficking.  The individual will then be given a temporary permission (initially a 60 days ‘recovery and reflection’ period, followed by a six  month Temporary Residence Permission which may be renewed) to remain in the State, subject to the conditions set out in the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking.

Tallaght Garda Station forms part of the DMR South Division and on that date the personnel strength of the DMR South Division was 638. There are 10 Juvenile Liaison Officers and 55 Community Gardaí attached to the DMR South Garda Division.  The allocation of resources in An Garda Síochána, including the distribution of personnel, is a matter for the Commissioner and senior Garda Management and it is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within each Division. Garda management will continue to monitor the situation in the DMR South Division with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.

The information sought by the Deputy is therefore not readily available.  Proposals for the introduction of measures to ensure a visibly independent appeals process in immigration matters have previously been outlined to the House. In summary, I propose to provide, on a statutory basis, for the introduction of formal review processes in respect of decisions that arise at various stages of the immigration process. Comprehensive statutory proposals in this regard are now contained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010. It is also my intention to appoint, on an administrative basis at first, a person to act as chief review officer with the function of ensuring that there is consistency and a high quality of decision-making among those who deal under the Bill with visa reviews.These proposals lay the foundation for the fulfilment, during the lifetime of this Government, of the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government to ensure a visibly independent appeals process in immigration matters.  In the longer term, the model that I have in mind is that of the social welfare appeals system which is operated by staff of the Minister for Social Protection but in a manner that affords people dealing with the system a second look at the merits of their case independent of the original decision maker.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1642	Complaints by residents of direct provision centres are dealt with in accordance with the procedures outlined in the recently published revised house rules and procedures of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which are available on the RIA website at http://www.ria.gov.ie.  A copy of these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre.Experience has shown that, given the nature and the number of such complaints, they are best resolved by informal discussion between residents and management at a local level.  Where more serious complaints arise that cannot be resolved informally, residents have the right to lodge a formal written complaint with centre management and are entitled to a response within 14 days.  If the issue remains unresolved, the resident has the right to take their complaint to RIA.  RIA will make a determination on the complaint and the results of that decision are binding on both centre management and residents.  If the resident's complaint is upheld, RIA will ensure that management take appropriate action to rectify the situation.I should say that rules and procedures were only recently revised arising from a report from a Working Party, the membership of which included the Refugee Information Service and the Irish Refugee Council.  During those Working Party discussions the issue of an independent appeals mechanism, on which differing views were held, was fully discussed.  The system of direct provision is sui generis and a complaints resolution procedure operating in that context must be one that is fair and efficient but also workable.  I am satisfied that, given the time and effort devoted by the Working Party to try and come up with a complaints procedure that achieves a balance between these requirements that the current procedure is the best that can be achieved in the circumstances.  It will, nonetheless, remain under constant review.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1652	The Deputy will appreciate that white collar crime contains elements which relate to the responsibilities of a number of Government Departments in addition to the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Insofar as my own Department is concerned developments in this area include the coming into operation on 15 July this year of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, which transposes the requirements of the third EU money laundering Directive into Irish Law and which also responds to recommendations of  the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The legislation strengthens and updates our laws in this area. It provides for additional measures to be taken by the designated persons encompassed by the Act, including credit and financial institutions, insurance intermediaries and the legal and accountancy professions, to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.The Deputy will also be aware that the Oireachtas is currently considering the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 which is primarily intended to ensure greater compliance with the OECD Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. I am proposing in this Bill to provide for protection for "whistleblowers" in respect of reports, in good faith, of suspicions of offences under our prevention of corruption legislation. I expect that consideration of this Bill by the Oireachtas will be completed during the current parliamentary session. Anti corruption legislation in this jurisdiction dates back to 1889 and has been dealt with in a number of different statutes since that time. With a view to bringing greater clarity and accessibility to the law in this area, I  announced earlier this year my intention to consolidate all of the anti corruption legislation in a single statute. Work on this consolidation process is expected to commence shortly.In May of this year I requested that An Garda Síochána look at the law in relation to white collar crime particularly in the light of the experience gained in the investigation of this kind of offence and if necessary to put forward for consideration proposals for changes in the law which would be in the public interest.  In the context of the White Paper on Crime which will set out the overall framework for strategies to deal with crime in the future, my Department will shortly publish a Discussion Document on the general area. The Discussion Document will be informed by the views of a wide range of interested parties being consulted in the matter, including the general public and practitioners, along with An Garda Síochána. The Government will give careful consideration to all of the issues which will arise on foot of this consultation.

The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.The Deputy will be aware of the service to T.D.s and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the PRA for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.

My Department did not provide information to the author in question from any files retained by my Department.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1656	Death in Garda Custody refers to a death which takes place after a person comes into the custody and control of a Garda and before leaving the custody and control of a Garda. Thus it includes, for example, a death at any time from the time of arrest, including the handing of a person into the care of a hospital for treatment, or prison while under the control of a Garda.  The Deputy should be aware that all deaths in State care are the subject of an inquest.I have requested the information in the format sought by the Deputy from the Garda Authorities.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to compile all of the details sought in the time available and I will be in contact with the Deputy when this information is to hand.What I can say at the moment is that prior to the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, investigations into deaths occurring in Garda custody were carried out by a Superintendent from outside the Garda Division, appointed by the Divisional Officer.  However, under Section 102 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is now required to refer to the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) any matter that appears to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána may have resulted in the death or serious harm to a person.Since GSOC has become operational in May 2007, six deaths in Garda Stations have been investigated by GSOC, details of which are in the following table:YearGarda StationInquest heldInquest decisionOther outcome2007TraleeNoOngoing GSOC case2007TerenureYesOngoingOngoing GSOC case2009NavanNoOngoing GSOC case2010TallaghtNoOngoing GSOC case2010TemplemoreNoOngoing GSOC case2010DundalkNoOngoing GSOC case

The most recent  data indicates that there are currently 141 mobile phones in use by staff of my Department.The current contract for supply of this service is with Vodafone.  Following an EU procurement exercise, a Mobile Framework has been established to provide non-commercial public sector bodies with a simple way to procure Mobile Voice and Data Services at competitive rates from a list of qualified vendors.  This tender was restricted to qualified vendors under the Mobile Framework.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1658	A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was first received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in August 2007 and I decided in my absolute discretion not to grant a certificate of naturalisation. The person concerned was informed of this decision and the reasons for it in a letter issued to him via his legal representatives on 9 March, 2010.There is no appeals process under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.The person in question lodged a new valid application for a certificate of naturalisation with the Citizenship Division of my Department in May 2010.All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

To date two major rounds of this Scheme have been advertised, in 2005 and 2007. I am advised by Pobal who administer the scheme on behalf of my Department that no application for Tramore, Co. Waterford has been received.Any further plans for extension of CCTV are dependent on a number of factors, including the progression of the schemes already grant aided, the availability of funding and overall policy considerations.

Staff of these agencies and executive offices are, with the exception of technical and professional grades, interchangeable with staff of the Department and their staffing numbers can go up or down at any given time depending on overall priorities.  There are a total of 1,961 whole-time equivalent staff serving in my Department and agencies and executive offices staffed by it (including administrative staff in the Irish Prisons Service).The following table provides a grade breakdown of this figure, which does not include bodies in the wider Justice Sector which recruit their own staff such as An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, Legal Aid Board, Property Registration Authority, and non-administrative staff in the Irish Prison Service.GradeWhole-time Equivalent (rounded)Secretary General1Director General INIS1Assistant Secretary5Principal Officer77Assistant Principal Officer148Higher Executive Officer200Administrative Officer23Executive Officer341Staff Officer33Clerical Officer619Head Services Officer1Services Officer55Director Probation Service1Deputy Director Probation Service3Assistant Director Probation Service2Assistant Principal Probation Officer10Senior Probation Officer50Probation Officer230Community Service Supervisors43State Pathologist1Deputy State Pathologist2Director Forensic Science Laboratory1Deputy Director Forensic Science Laboratory4Forensic Scientist Grade 19Forensic Scientist Grade 226Forensic Scientist Grade 321Senior Laboratory Analyst9Laboratory Analyst14Chief Inspector, Garda Síochána Inspectorate1Data Protection Commissioner1Chairman Refugee Appeals Tribunal1Director General Irish Prisons Service1Director, Irish Prisons Service2Inspector of Prisons1Translator Grade 21Senior Inspector of Explosives1Inspector of Explosives2Accountant Grade 12Accountant Grade 23Solicitor1Legal Officer1Financial Crime Analyst3Forensic Accountant1Statistician2Psychologist1Employee Assistance Officer1Legal Researcher1Researcher3Civilian Driver1Total1,961

My Department does not comment on individual cases that may be the subject of an application to the Central Authority for Child Abduction that operates in the Department for the purposes of international arrangements in the matter. However, I can say that a function of the Central Authority is to keep a parent informed of the progress of his or her application.

The Coroner has advised my Department that he endeavours to ensure that the set-up is appropriate in the context of the needs of grieving family members, and that in his experience, the arrangement is more suitable than the previous arrangement whereby inquests were held in Tallaght and Dun Laoghaire courthouses. While my Department has asked the Coroner to keep the location for holding inquests under review, there are no proposals, in the current economic climate, to provide a custom-built coronial facility in the Dublin county area.The reform of the Coroner Service is addressed in the Coroners Bill 2007 which is currently before the Seanad. This provides for updating of the law in regard to coronial practice, a reorganisation of coronial districts and a restructuring of the system which would contribute to an enhanced service to the public.

Cork to serve the Munster region is a key element of the prisons modernisation programme. It is accepted that conditions at Cork prison are less than ideal and the new facilities at Kilworth will, when complete, allow for the decommissioning of the accommodation at Cork Prison and its replacement with new  modern prison facilities. It is anticipated that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450.The development at Kilworth will also include accommodation and facilities for female prisoners.A suitable site has been identified at Kilworth following consultation with the Defence Forces and preliminary discussions have been held with Cork County Council in relation to the provision of the necessary access road and ancillary services to the site. It is intended to commence preliminary planning and design work on the project next year and to deliver the project on a phased basis with the first phase  expected to come on stream by 2014.I should also add that  the Irish Prison Service of my Department is currently  in discussions with the Department of Defence regarding the legal transfer of the lands to the Department of Justice and Law Reform. It is also anticipated that further meetings will be arranged with the local residents in the coming months to appraise them of the current status of the project.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1665	The Private Security Services Act 2004, which established the Private Security Authority, provides the legislative background under which the Authority operates and under which private security licences are granted.  The vetting of applicants by an Garda Síochána is an integral part of the licensing process and since the Authority commenced licensing in 2006 over 37,000 persons have been vetted by the Garda Central Vetting Unit on behalf of the Authority.The Authority has additional powers under Section 34 of the aforementioned Act to request information from the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána and this allows for the Authority to seek information which may not be available through the vetting process.  Powers are also available under Section 13 of the Act to request information as part of an investigation being conducted by the Authority.I am informed that the Authority is satisfied that the powers currently available to it are sufficient for its purpose.  I have therefore no proposals to amend the legislation in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1666	The purpose of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 is to amend the law relating to the ownership and management of the common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of bodies responsible for the management of those common areas.As regards existing multi-unit developments, section 2(5) of the Bill provides that except where otherwise provided, its provisions will, when enacted, apply to every multi-unit development. Sections 3 and 14 will apply only to future developments but all other sections will apply to existing developments, including section 16 which will require transparency and fairness in the calculation of service charges. As regards the establishment of a sinking fund, section 17(6) provides that the obligation to establish such a fund arises either 3 years after the sale of the first residential unit in the development, or 18 months after commencement of section 17, whichever is the later. It is likely that the 18 month deadline will apply to most existing multi-unit developments without a sinking fund.

Resource levels are constantly monitored, in conjunction with crime trends and other demands made on An Garda Síochána, and the situation is kept under continuing review.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1668	Proposals in relation to the opening of Garda stations are a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to by the Deputy is patrolled by both uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the District Detective and Drug Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  In addition, four dedicated Community Policing Gardaí operate in the area.I am further advised that the Garda authorities do not favour the opening of a new station in the area and they are satisfied that it is being provided with a comprehensive policing service.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1669	The Guidelines for the test purchasing scheme were drawn up by a working group comprising representatives of the Gardaí, Office of the Minister for Children, Office of Tobacco Control and the Departments of Health and Children, and Justice and Law Reform. The primary concern of the group in drafting the guidelines has been to ensure the welfare of children. For this purpose, it drew on test purchasing guidelines already in operation in England, and also had Northern Ireland's guidelines at its disposal. During the drafting process, Garda representatives visited Liverpool to observe test purchasing operations on the ground as well as the training and other safeguards put in place to safeguard the welfare of the young people involved in test purchasing operations. I am satisfied therefore that the welfare of those involved has been taken fully into account in drafting the guidelines and the test purchasing scheme. I welcome the widespread support across the floor of the House for this initiative.As the Deputy is aware, there is no statutory requirement in the legislation establishing the Ombudsman for Children requiring Ministers to refer proposed legislation to the Ombudsman for an assessment of its effect on children. However, the legislation allows the Ombudsman, on his or her own initiative, to give advice on any matter relating to the rights and welfare of children. It is open to the Ombudsman, therefore, to give advice at any time on any such matters.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1670	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1181 and 1182 together.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. The CSO recorded crime statistics, which are published quarterly and annually, provide figures on offences recorded by An Garda Síochána, including incidences of anti-social behaviour such as public disorder and criminal damage.I have requested the CSO to provide relevant statistics directly to the Deputy.I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána has available an analysis service which works with its management structure in identifying and mapping areas that require Garda attention in the context of anti-social behaviour and criminal activity, in addition to a number of other policing matters.  Garda management utilises the results of this analysis when putting in place appropriate policing plans to prevent and detect criminal offences.One of the priorities I determined for An Garda Síochána in 2010 is the achievement of the maximum levels of safety for local communities.  Key actions in the Garda Policing Plan for 2010 include reducing public disorder, assaults and criminal damage, and in this regard there is a commitment to identifying and proactively targeting local "hot spots".In 2009, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a new Garda National Model of Community Policing.  The Model builds on the success of existing good community policing practice within Ireland and aims to foster collaborative partnerships between An Garda Síochána and members of the community.  There is a range of well established community policing initiatives in place to track and evaluate matters of local interest, to both urban and rural communities, that require Garda attention.  In addition, An Garda Síochána is also closely engaged in the work of various local structures, including  Local Drug Task Forces and Joint Policing Committees, which enable them to respond to the concerns of communities about anti-social behaviour and criminal activities.Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) are nationwide, community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour.  The aim is to provide suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long term employability prospects of young people who have come to the attention of the Gardaí.In 2008 the Irish Youth Justice Service carried out a baseline Analysis of the 100 GYDPs around the country with the subsequent report Designing Effective Local Responses to Youth Crime published in 2009 and available on the IYJS website.  The report included a number of recommendations to improve the operation of the GYDPs.  These recommendations are currently being implemented in five trial sites, and all of the report's recommendations will be substantially implemented by the end of this year.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1671	I am informed by the Garda authorities that all acts of a criminal nature are dealt with appropriately under the relevant legislation.Strong provisions are in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  A range of provisions including the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provide the Gardaí with powers to address public order problems and anti-social behaviour related to the misuse of alcohol. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 imposes minimum statutory obligations on landlords and tenants of private residential tenancies.  Tenant obligations under the Act include an obligation not to engage, or allow visitors to engage, in anti-social behaviour. The Act also imposes an obligation on landlords to enforce the tenant obligations.There is provision in the Act for third parties who are adversely affected by a failure on the part of a landlord to enforce tenant obligations to refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) in accordance with the procedures in the Act. Since December 2004 all privately-rented properties must be registered with the PRTB. It is possible to check if a property is registered by contacting the PRTB.Where incidents of anti-social behaviour occur on private property the provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 are applicable.  The remedies available under the Act are civil in nature.  These include those under section 108 which provides for noise as a nuisance and the remedies available to aggrieved parties.  The Act provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.There is a commitment in the programme for Government to introduce comprehensive legislation to address noise nuisance.  The General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was brought to Government by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and approved in May 2009.  It is intended that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise nuisance and strengthen existing local authority powers, including through the introduction of a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.  Codes of practice for domestic situations will also be developed.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1672	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is within the Clontarf Garda Sub-District.  Local Garda management is aware of two incidents of the type referred to by the Deputy at the location referred to in the past six months.  The investigations into the incidents are ongoing.  No direct link has been established between these incidents and the type of activity referred to by the Deputy.A community Garda has been designated for the area and has met a number of residents.  The community Garda has called to the homes of the victims and offered crime prevention advice and information.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel. Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This approach will promote an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents.

In particular members of the Garda Síochána attached to GNIB who have been appointed as immigration officers, fulfil immigration control duties at ports of entry to the State, while others are assigned to investigative duties, which include the prevention and detection of human trafficking and smuggling of illegal immigrants and the process of registering non-nationals who are in the State for reasons other than vacation.  When the need arises, personnel assigned to immigration control, investigative, or registration related duties, are diverted to duties relating to the removal process.

Among those recommendations is the adoption, by landlords and tenants alike, of a rent review arbitration code which is intended to achieve a uniform and transparent procedure for the resolution of disputes in the sector.  The recommendations also deal with the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.The Deputy will recall that, because of significant legal constraints, it was not possible to apply the provision at Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in a retrospective manner, i.e., where the lease in question had been entered into prior to the commencement of that section.   Those legal constraints continue to exist. They were recognised by Members of the Deputy's Party during the Debate on Section 132 of the Act.

The Scheduling of the Bill in the House with a view to its enactment is a matter for agreement between the party whips.  I would like to remind the Deputy that the main functions of the Authority include the following, as I indicated in my response to the PQs referred to above:Establishing and administering a comprehensive licensing system covering all providers of property services, (i.e. Auctioneers, Estate Agents, Letting Agents and Property Management Agents — collectively known as Property Services Providers).  This extended system will replace the current licensing system for Auctioneers and House Agents under the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973;Setting and enforcing standards for the grant of licences (e.g. educational/training standards; levels of professional   indemnity insurance) as well as standards to be observed in the provision of property services by licensees;Establishing and administering a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services, including the imposition of sanctions as appropriate;Conducting audits and inspections of Property Services Providers as part of a general compliance and enforcement function;Developing and enforcing Codes of Practice;Promoting increased consumer protection and public awareness (where appropriate in liaison and co-operation with other statutory bodies and relevant professional and consumer bodies) of property services in general and the cost to consumers, risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services;Producing guidance material for the industry and the public;Establishing, maintaining and administering a Compensation Fund to compensate parties who lose money as a direct consequence of the dishonesty of a licensee.Enforcing licensees obligations under the legislation through general investigations, inspections and court prosecutions;Liaison and co-operation with overseas Authorities.Pending enactment of the legislation, the PSRA Implementation Group was established, on a non statutory basis, to assist and advise on practical matters relating to the establishment of the new Authority and a Chief Executive designate was appointed and is working closely with the Group in making arrangements for the establishment of the Authority and its structures including the basic organisational structures, systems, procedures, protocols, rules and regulations, which are fundamental to the long term functioning of the Authority.To date the PSRA Implementation Group has, in advance of the Authority being placed on a statutory footing, carried out much of the preparatory work necessary to enable it to carry out its statutory functions including:the successful completion of  the necessary arrangements for the acquisition and fitting out of accommodation for the Authority in Navan, Co. Meath;drafting Codes of Practice for Auctioneers and Estate Agents, Letting Agents and Management Agents which identifies the key principles and values that should guide the day to day practice of service providers;establishing a National Public Register of all licensed Auctioneers and House Agents.;developing and putting in place financial and accounting systems for the Authority;designing and developing a website as part of the education and awareness function;designing and developing a computerised licensing and complaints databases suitable for the Authority's long term requirements;developing and implementing an office, file management and data management system for the Authority;developing the systems, procedures rules and regulations necessary for the establishment of a Compensation Fund, including prescribing the manner of reporting of losses sustained by clients and the procedures for applications for grants from the Fund;developing the rules and regulations which will govern the level of professional indemnity insurance which a Property Services Provider must have in place including the Minimum Terms and Conditions of such insurance;establishing a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints relating to the provision of property services;preparing public information material on the provision of property services, including the purchase and sale of property;drafting rules and regulations governing complaints procedures.reviewing all aspects of the work undertaken by Property Services Providers in Ireland and equivalent services in appropriate comparable jurisdictions for the purpose of prescribing the minimum education/qualification requirements necessary for the grant of licences;establishing protocols for the vetting of all applicants for licences;drafting rules and regulations for the carrying out of investigations, inspections and audits of Property Services Providers' practices;drafting rules and regulations governing the operation of Property Services Providers' accounting procedures including the manner of keeping all accounting records;drafting rules and regulations governing the operation of client accounts;prescribing the rights, duties and responsibilities of Property Services Providers in relation to moneys received, held, controlled or paid in connection with the provision of property services;prescribing the rules governing the auditing of Property Services Providers' accounts.Many of the rules and regulations which have been or are being drafted will be introduced once the Bill has been enacted.  The work undertaken to date will ensure that the complex systems, procedures, rules, regulations and protocols, necessary for the effective operation of the Authority, can be put in place quickly following the passing of the legislation.With regard to current staffing levels at the PSRA pending the enactment of the legislation to establish it on a statutory basis, there is a Chief Executive designate, six full-time and two part-time staff.The PSRA has incurred expenditure of €347,000 from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2010. With regard to  earlier years I wish to refer the Deputy to the Abridged Estimates Volume for Public Services 2010 and the Revised Estimates for Public Services for each of the years concerned. Copies of the Abridged Estimates Volume for Public Services and the Revised Estimates for Public Services are available at www.finance.gov.ie and in the Oireachtas Library.Once the Authority has been put on a statutory footing it will be in a position to establish and administer a comprehensive complaints investigation system and a Compensation Fund to compensate persons for losses resulting from the dishonesty of Property Services Providers.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1685	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1199, 1200, 1208 to 1210, inclusive, and 1212, together.The international target for spending on Official Development Assistance is 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP). This is known as the UN ODA target. The EU has adopted this objective and Ireland is committed to meeting the 0.7% expenditure on ODA by 2015.Over the 10 year period from 2000 to 2009, Ireland spent almost €6 billion on ODA, an enormous level of expenditure by any reckoning. This level of ODA has made Ireland one of the most generous donors in the world and we are currently placed as the 7th most generous international donor on a per capita basis.Ireland expended 0.54% of GNP on ODA in 2009. In 2010 we expect to spend 0.52% of our GNP on ODA, thereby exceeding the interim EU target of 0.51%. While our ODA budget for 2010 represents a small decline in overall aid expenditure, this must be viewed in the context of the difficult economic situation facing this country and the imperative of returning stability to our public finances.Over the coming months the Government will finalise preparations for Budget 2011. The over-riding aim will be to restore growth to the economy. This is the indispensable basis for the resumption of sustainable growth in the aid programme, to which we are committed. In the coming years, decisions on the budgetary allocations to ODA for each year will be made in the context of the progress made in achieving sustainable economic growth.It is important to note that ODA as a percentage of GNP is only one measure used to compare our aid programme with that of our peers. Volumes are a measure of an aid programme. Quality is an equally if not more important measure. Ireland's aid programme is internationally recognised as being of the highest quality and having a sharp focus on poverty reduction and hunger eradication at its core. Most of Ireland's bilateral ODA is directed to the least developed countries, with a particular focus on a limited number of very poor partner countries, called Programme Countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Our aid programme has been peer reviewed very positively, as lately as 2009 by the OECD, and described as ‘cutting edge', ‘sharply focused on poverty reduction' and providing a ‘leadership role in aid effectiveness'. The Government is determined that those qualities continue to be delivered across Ireland's aid programme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1686	The Deputy refers to the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian mother of two whose stoning sentence has caused the gravest concern in Ireland and internationally. The case of Ms. Ashtianai has been raised with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland by officials in my Department who have conveyed in the strongest terms that Ireland is completely opposed to the use of stoning, a practice which has no place in the 21st century. Ireland joins others in the international community, including EU High Representative Ashton, who have issued strong calls upon the Iranian government to revoke the death sentence in the case of Ms Ashtiani.The EU has also been active in raising this case in Tehran with a detailed démarche delivered on behalf of the EU on the Ashtiani case and other human rights issues on 29 August. In response, the Iranian authorities have indicated that the stoning sentence would not be applied and that Ms Ashtiani would not be executed for adultery. However, no clear commitment has so far been given that there are no circumstances in which the death sentence will be applied to Ms. Ashtiani. I call on Iran to provide such a commitment.There are also worrying reports about Ms Ashtiani's family, particularly her children, being subjected to harassment and imprisonment for bravely speaking out about this case. I am also appalled that Ms Ashtiani's lawyer, Mr Mostafaei, has had to leave his country, simply for doing his job and defending his clients as best as he can.Ms. Ashtiani's case is symptomatic of the very poor human rights situation overall now obtaining in Iran. I have raised Ireland's serious concerns about the lack of respect for human rights in Iran directly with the Iranian authorities on a number of occasions, most recently when I met with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin on 9 June. During that meeting, I also outlined Ireland and the EU's particular concerns about the extensive use of the death penalty in Iran, an issue which we also highlighted in our national intervention at the current UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva on 17 September. I have also written at length to Foreign Minister Mottaki on a number of occasions to express our concerns about, and raise specific aspects of, the human rights situation in Iran.  Ireland will continue to raise our concerns on the human rights situation in Iran, both bilaterally and at multilateral organisations such as the UN Human Rights Council.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1687	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1202 and 1203 together.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's strong views on the illegality of the construction of the separation barrier on occupied land.  While we recognise the responsibility on the Israeli Government to provide for the security of its citizens, I have regularly expressed my serious concern about the negative consequences of the continuing construction of the barrier, both for the daily lives of the Palestinian people and for the viability of a two-State solution.  The Government has raised the issues involved directly with Israel, through the EU and at the United Nations.  We have been to the fore in ensuring that the European Union continues to affirm that it will recognise no changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those negotiated between the parties in the context of a final status agreement. Ireland, and its EU partners, has consistently called on Israel to abide by the 2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice that found that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), was contrary to international law.It should be noted that our concerns relate not to the construction of the wall itself, but the routing of very lengthy sections of the wall across Palestinian land, effectively cutting off large areas of Palestinian territory, which are left connected to Israel but isolated from the rest of the West Bank.  Ireland is very concerned about the imprisonment of human rights defenders in the Occupied Territories for exercising their right to peacefully protest against the route of the separation barrier.  Local EU representatives attended all court hearings in the case of Abdallah Abu Rahma, who was convicted in an Israeli military court on charges of incitement and organising and attending demonstrations.  A representative of our Mission in Ramallah attended his sentencing hearing on 15 September to highlight our concern about this case.I am not aware of any links between Irish companies and companies contracted to build the separation barrier. Cement Roadstone Holdings owns a minority shareholding of approximately 25% in Mashav Initiating and Development Limited, which is the holding company for the main Israeli cement producer, Nesher. This 25% stake does not give CRH any control over Nesher's operational matters. The Israeli company supplies cement to all of the concrete manufacturers in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Nesher does not have a say in the final use of the concrete products. It has no direct involvement in the construction of the separation barrier.

The programme is administered by the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid. Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Cooperation budget.Details of the amounts spent on ODA are as follows:YearVote 29Other ODATotal ODA% of GNP€ million€ million€ million%20054651135780.4320065952198140.5420077261458710.5420087691529210.5920095721507220.542010536*135*671*0.52**Estimated.Through Irish Aid, the Government provides assistance to in excess of 80 countries in the developing world, with a strong focus on the least developed countries, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1689	As Minister of State with responsibility for our overseas aid budget, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that development aid reaches its intended beneficiaries and that it makes a real difference in the lives of the poor. I can assure the Deputy that Irish Aid has in place a comprehensive programme of appraisal, monitoring, audit, and evaluation of our expenditures designed to ensure that funds are spent effectively and benefit the most vulnerable people of the countries in which we and our partners operate.  Irish Aid expenditure is subject to rigorous accounting, evaluation and audit controls. Programmes are regularly audited and evaluated by independent audit firms and by Irish Aid's own Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Unit's work is also examined by my Department's independent Audit Committee. Development expenditures are furthermore examined by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of the annual audit of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  As well as ensuring that Ireland's development funding reaches those most in need, such arrangements necessitate the improvement of national systems of accounting and auditing in the countries in which we operate, thereby building local capacity to deliver basic services effectively and transparently. Irish Aid supports programmes for the improvement of national accounting systems and training of national offices of auditors general. We also continuously monitor programme and project quality in order to ensure effective results and that our programmes are reaching their target populations. This emphasis on effectiveness and quality has been recognised internationally, including by the OECD in its latest evaluation of our aid programme which stated that "the structure of Irish Aid's programme ensures that the capacity and policy benefits of programme aid are achieved whilst improvements in the quality and accountability of public financial management together with rigorous oversight ensure that Irish funds are correctly used."  Project proposals which are submitted are appraised using a number of key criteria, including quality of proposed impact, intended beneficiaries, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources. Where funds are provided to organisations such as NGOs it is a fundamental condition of such funding that annual audited accounts are provided to us.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1690	Each year Ireland provides assistance to people affected by humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters in developing countries.  In the period referred to by the Deputy the following funding was provided under the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund (EHAF) managed as part of the Irish Aid programme of official development assistance (ODA):2005:  €37,500,000;2006: €60,000,000;2007: €90,000,000;2008: €87,000,000;2009: €56,000,000;2010: €44,762,232 (to date).Funding provided from EHAF is delivered to organisations which respond directly to the humanitarian needs of those caught up in disasters or conflict situations, such as United Nations agencies, the International Red Cross movement and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).  In 2010, Ireland has responded to a number of significant humanitarian challenges including the devastating earthquake which struck Haiti in January and the recent flooding in Pakistan. Ireland also responds to emergencies through providing pre-positioned humanitarian supplies and key personnel with specific emergency related skills through the Rapid Response Initiative.In addition to emergency humanitarian assistance, Ireland also contributes to the efforts of people in the affected areas to rebuild their lives following these humanitarian emergencies.  Effective recovery strategies are designed to ensure that the affected areas have greater capacity to withstand future natural disasters. All of Ireland's emergency aid falls within that proportion of our GNP which is allocated for development assistance and all of the specific projects and programmes and costs are outlined in the Irish Aid Annual Reports for each year which have been placed in the Dáil Library.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1692	The people of Pakistan have recently experienced the worst flooding in their history.  The United Nations reports that the floods have affected an estimated 20 million people — or one tenth of the country's entire population.  More than 1,700 people are known to have lost their lives as a result of the tragedy and with flood waters continuing to spread in areas such as Sindh, there are fears that this death toll may rise. In those areas where the flooding has receded, millions of people have been left destitute.The Government has allocated more than €2.5 million in humanitarian assistance to help tackle this crisis, including through support for the activities of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Food Programme and UNICEF as well Concern, Trócaire, Goal and Plan Ireland. Irish Aid has also carried out two airlifts of supplies to Pakistan, the second of which provided shelter and water equipment for 33,000 people and was the single largest shipment of humanitarian supplies ever undertaken by the State. These airlifts were carried out on Ireland's behalf by the World Food Programme through its network of Humanitarian Response Depots.In parallel with the Government's direct response to the crisis, Ireland also supports the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which provides immediate funds to UN agencies and NGOs in such emergencies. Ireland has provided €73 million to the CERF since 2006. Irish Aid also supports the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), to which €1 million has been provided in 2010.Wider issues relating to heavy-lift transport and other logistics within the flood-hit regions are co-ordinated by the UN with the Government of Pakistan.  At this stage, no request has been received with regard to the provision of additional external support along the lines proposed by the Deputy.  In circumstances such as this one, light civilian helicopters are unfortunately unlikely to meet the needs of the UN and Pakistani Government given the logistical, geographical, technical and capacity issues involved. For the immediate future, the focus of the international community will continue to be centred on life-saving assistance in Pakistan but as flood waters recede, this will need to be complemented by projects to re-establish agricultural livelihoods and to restore basic services such as education, health and nutrition.In this context, Ireland will continue to support the ongoing efforts being made by the Government of Pakistan, the United Nations and NGOs as they seek to provide rescue, relief and early recovery to those affected by the floods.

Constituency staff for each Minister and Minister of State are accommodated in an open plan office with the Personal Assistant, where relevant, located in a small single office.  Ministers of State with responsibility for Overseas Development are provided with similar constituency office accommodation. In the case of Minister of State Michael Kitt T.D. this was located in Bishops Square, Dublin 2 and for Minister of State Peter Power T.D. the accommodation is in Riverstone House, Limerick.The value of all such property, whether rented or owned by the State, is a matter for the Office of Public Works.It is not possible to isolate the cost of utilities and accommodation-related services for these offices, i.e. cleaning and waste disposal, from the overall bills in respect of the buildings in question.
IT, communication and other costs
Each member of staff based in the Ministerial offices in the Department's premises is provided with IT and communication facilities from the Department's stocks i.e. PC, phone, print and faxing facilities and appropriate licences. The estimated annual average cost of these is €750 per officer.Where officers are based in external constituency offices there is an initial set-up cost in providing the equipment and services at an average cost of €2,500.Based on these estimated average costs, and including any expenditure on telephone charges and other non standard equipment, the following table sets out the IT and communication expenditure relating to Ministerial constituency offices for the periods in question.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1694	I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which trade union activists, including teachers and human rights defenders have been treated in Colombia.  Colombia has witnessed the longest period of upheaval of any country in Latin America — over 50 years in all. The Colombian people have endured relentless suffering, reflected in the more than two million persons who have been internally displaced over the past number of years, a number second only to that of Sudan. The degree of lawlessness that arises from the absence of peace presents a major challenge to any government.  The effects of terrorism and narco-trafficking have blighted the lives of many innocent people.  However, compared with the situation ten years ago, Colombia today has become a safer place to live. Colombians' belief in the prospects for a peaceful future and the impressive recent social and economic development reflected in the strong inward investment flows reinforce the impression that the country is slowly emerging from a grim past.On 7 August, President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón was inaugurated as President of Colombia.  During his inaugural address, President Santos emphasised that human rights would be a key issue during his term of office.  Specifically, the President stated that it was his firm position that respect for life was a sacred mandate, that respect for the freedom and integrity of people was an inescapable obligation and that advocacy of human rights was the firm and irrevocable commitment of his government.   President Santos has stated that Colombia's Ministry of Justice will be re-established as the Ministry of Justice and Rights with a view to strengthening the state's policy in support of justice and protecting fundamental rights.  I am encouraged that President Santos has tasked his Vice President, Angelina Garzón, with particular responsibility for taking forward his government's programme in this important area.  Furthermore, I have written to Foreign Minister María Ángela Holguin Cuéllar to indicate my continuing interest in human rights dialogue with the Colombian government.Ireland was represented at President Santos' inauguration by our Ambassador to Colombia, who is resident in Mexico City. The Ambassador reiterated to the Colombian authorities the importance we continue to attach to human rights and our strong support for the commitment made by the President in this respect. The Ambassador raised my concern about the level of violence against trade unionists in the course of his official contacts.In May of this year, funding of €100,000 was approved for a victim support project being organised by the Organisation of American States in three regions of Colombia.  This project will train victims to allow them to participate effectively in the judicial process and to access reparation; create awareness among local authorities so as to assist in the reintegration of victims in their communities and establish confidence-building measures between communities and local authorities.The Government will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico and in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1695	The Government is closely engaged at the European Union and international level in monitoring the situation in Burma and in supporting the struggle of the Burmese people for democracy and human rights. I have met with representatives of some of the main ethnic minority groups in the country. I remain deeply concerned about the allegations that have been made by these groups that they have been subjected to grave breaches of international humanitarian law by the Burmese regime.The Government has expressed its concern internationally about the treatment of ethnic minorities by the regime in Burma. One such minority is the Rohingya, as highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma, Tomas Quintana, in his report to the Human Rights Council in March of this year. The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority group comprising some 800,000 people residing in North Arakan State in Western Burma. In addition, it is estimated that there are many hundreds of thousands of refugees in neighbouring countries. The persecution of the Rohingya by the Burmese authorities is predicated on the basis of the denial of their right to citizenship.The Government has long recognised the need to support the Rohingya and has responded in a practical way to their plight, including through the resettlement in Ireland of around eighty Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh, under the Government's refugee resettlement scheme, which is administered by the Department of Justice and Law Reform.At my request, the actions of the Burmese regime were discussed at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in April. On that occasion, Ministers called for a peaceful transition to a democratic, civilian and inclusive system of government in Burma. They agreed that the regime had not taken the necessary steps to make the elections, to be held on 7 November, credible, transparent and inclusive. There has been no substantive improvement since then to change that assessment.Notwithstanding the difficult position in which ethnic minorities and political parties have been placed by the actions of the regime, some ethnic groups are working to try to take advantage of the possible opportunity afforded by the elections to secure representation in local and national legislatures. However, I am extremely concerned at reports that the regime has moved to stifle further the rights of minorities in the lead-up to the elections.The Government also believes that a crucial element in the national reconciliation and democratisation process is the release without delay of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.  This could contribute to a new atmosphere in advance of the elections, allowing space for the initiation of a process of national dialogue and reconciliation, involving all opposition and ethnic groups. As the poll date draws nearer, I will continue to work closely with our European and international partners in support of human rights and democracy in Burma.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1696	The Passport Office database records and collates data on applicants by place of birth rather than place of residence.  In many cases this information is incomplete or inaccurate e.g. applicants may specify place of birth as Ireland rather than their county of birth.  It is therefore possible only to give estimated figures in response to this question.It is estimated that approximately 4,426,000 Irish citizens currently hold valid Irish passports. In relation to figures from Northern Ireland, I can confirm that up to end August 2010 31,275 applications were received through the Northern Ireland Passport Express Service available through post offices.  This figure compares with 37,000 for all of 2009, 38,400 applications in 2008 and 36,000 in 2007.In relation to figures from Great Britain, I can confirm that up to end August 2010 20,35 applications were received through the Passport Office in London.  This figure compares with 50,899 for all of 2009, 53,804 applications in 2008 and 51,169 in 2007. In relation to figures for the rest of the World, I can confirm that up to end August 2010 28,392 applications were received through Ireland's offices overseas.  This figure compares with 40,914 for all of 2009, 42,114 applications in 2008 and 41,410 in 2007.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1697	The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Over the past six years, Ireland has provided a total of 538 observers for election missions worldwide.  The missions involved have primarily been organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Ireland has also been represented in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs maintains a roster of volunteers for election monitoring missions.  There are currently some 280 volunteers on the roster.  They all have either overseas or domestic experience in the administration of elections, or have significant overseas development expertise.  Their place on the roster is based on the date of their last participation in a mission.  When a request for electoral observation is received, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster. A list of suitably qualified observers is then drawn up, taking into account their place on the roster and any specific criteria for the mission, including relevant language proficiency.  Following completion of the internal selection process, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.  The roster is updated as each mission is completed, to ensure that all registered volunteers have an opportunity to participate in a mission.  In the case of European Union election observation missions, all candidate observers must register with the European Commission as well as with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The final selection of observers rests with the Commission, based on an approved list submitted by the Department.  In the case of OSCE election observation missions, all the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.  The nomination of election observers is not covered by the code of practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments. However, the nomination process is carried out in line with the code's principles of consistency, fairness, transparency, accountability and diversity.   As with all activities supported by the Department, the election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively and provides the best possible value for money.(42 observers on 11 missions)CountryOrganisationRoleForenameSurname

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1700	On 12 August last I confirmed that the Passport Service had cleared the backlog of applications allowing the resumption of normal processing times.For passports submitted through the Passport Express and the Northern Ireland Postal Express services, a return within 10 working days is now guaranteed.  This service is available through local post offices and offers the simplest and most practical means of applying for a passport.  A service to prioritise applications for those with immediate travel plans is also available and applications, with proof of immediate travel, are guaranteed to be processed within three working days.  Applicants for this service should make contact with the Passport Service and provide this proof of travel.  An additional fee will apply in respect of such applications.  This is the fastest return time for any application, except for those whose travel is required for urgent humanitarian reasons.Passport applications submitted through the standard postal system are processed within four-six weeks.There is no general difference in processing times for those submitting their first application and those renewing their passport.  However, fast track services, viz. the three-day service, are not generally available to first time applicants or to those who are reporting their previous passport lost or stolen.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1703	On 28 July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the human right to water and sanitation. The resolution was adopted following a recorded vote of 122 in favour to none against, with 41 abstentions. Following careful consideration Ireland, along with seventeen of our European Union partners, took the decision to abstain from voting on this issue.Ireland is committed to the full realisation of all human rights, and to the realisation of the Millennium Development Goals, including that of reducing by half, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.   Ireland closely followed the negotiations on the draft resolution sponsored by Bolivia and supported suggestions put forward by the EU that, in our view, would have balanced the text and allowed the General Assembly to reach consensus on this very important issue. Unfortunately many of the EU suggestions were not taken into consideration and we did not feel that we could support in its entirety the final text presented to the General Assembly.In 2008, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution which recognised the existence of human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Ireland supported and co-sponsored that resolution. The Human Rights Council appointed for a period of three years an independent expert whose mandate includes the clarification of the content of human rights obligations, including non-discrimination, in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, in cooperation with and reflecting the views of Governments and relevant United Nations bodies, and in further cooperation with the private sector, local authorities, national human rights institutions, civil society organisations and academic institutions. This process being conducted by the independent expert, which Ireland supports, has already produced some valuable insights into the issues involved. The process is based on inclusiveness and aims at allowing the emergence of a consensus within the international community.The Bolivian-sponsored resolution presented to the General Assembly bypassed the Human Rights Council process, thereby prejudging the outcome of that process.  Ireland remains convinced that the only way to achieve real progress on access to safe drinking water and sanitation is to maintain consensus within the international community and we are committed to continuing to work in that direction with EU partners and the wider international community.Ireland through the Government's overseas development programme works with central and local Government in our Programme Countries, with civil society groups and with multilateral organisations to make progress on the achievement of MDG-7 to "halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to basic drinking water and sanitation".The 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid commits Ireland to "support activities across the programme to increase access to water and sanitation". Ireland recognises that sustained and equitable access to water is not only a life saving intervention in humanitarian responses but also critical to address the complex and multi-dimensional nature of poverty and vulnerability especially issues around child mortality, food security and gender equality.  In 2008, Irish Aid invested approximately 15% of its funding to support water and sanitation activities in least developed countries.

The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.My Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of mortgage interest supplement was published in July 2010. The report was published in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group.My Department is currently developing an implementation plan that will set out a framework for the future of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. This plan will be completed when the recommendations of the final report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group are available. This report is expected to be completed shortly.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1706	Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes.  The latest such statistics were released on September 2nd 2010 and cover developments up to and including 2007.  No comparable figures are yet available for 2008-2010.When examining such data, it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments.  For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland's pension system, is not counted as expenditure.The EUROSTAT release draws attention to the fact that the EU average masks major national differences in the structure of social protection funding, partly related to differing levels of wealth between countries, and also reflects differences in social protection systems, demographic trends, unemployment rates and other social, institutional and economic factorsThe level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, currently with the youngest population in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and healthcare/care of the elderly than most other member states.  In 2007, social protection expenditure accounted for 26.2% of GDP in the EU-27 countries. The corresponding ratio for Ireland was 18.9% — up 0.6 percentage points from 2006 (18.3%). According to recent OECD estimates (W. Adema — presentation to Social Justice Ireland conference, Sept 21st 2010), social protection expenditure could rise by 4 percentage points of GDP by 2011 due to increased Social Welfare expenditure and lower GDP levels compared to 2007.Ireland's per capita expenditure in 2007 (€6,561.30), is higher than the EU-27 average of €5,725.90 and the average annual growth in per capita expenditure between 2000 and 2006 was 8.7%, second only to Romania (11.6%) in the EU, and over four times the EU25 average of 1.9% for this period (EU27 was 1.2%). Overall spending on Social Welfare in Ireland in 2009 was €20.6 billion, an increase of just over 15% on 2008 (€17.8 billion) and 32% on 2007 (€15.5 billion).
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1707	The administration of the Civil Registration Service is statutorily a matter for the Registrar General.  I have had inquiries made with the Registrar General and he has informed me that the position is as follows.When a person dies, it is the duty of a relative of the deceased to act as qualified informant.  This means that the relative must give to a registrar of births, deaths and marriages the information necessary to register the death, including a medical certificate of the cause of death, which is obtainable from the medical practitioner who attended the deceased, and sign the register of deaths.In certain circumstances, a death is referred to the coroner.  There is a legal responsibility on doctors, registrars, undertakers, Gardaí, hospitals and nursing homes to inform the coroner where a death occurs suddenly or unexpectedly, or from a cause unknown, unclear or unnatural, or where the deceased was not seen or treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month prior to death.  In such cases, the coroner may request a post-mortem examination.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to natural causes, the coroner may issue a certificate to the registrar, who can then proceed to register the death and issue a death certificate.  If the post-mortem shows that a death was due to unnatural causes, the coroner may cause an inquest to be held.   In such cases, the registrar must await the outcome of the inquest and the issue by the coroner of a coroner's certificate before the death can be registered.In the case of the person concerned, the death has been referred to the coroner for County Kildare who is now awaiting the outcome of a post-mortem examination.  It is a matter for the Coroner to decide what course of action to take when this is available to him.When the deliberations of the coroner have been concluded, a certificate will be issued by him to the registrar and the registrar must then register the death.  A death certificate in respect of the death can then be obtained from the office of any registrar.

My Department has agreed that where people access the internet using a landline, the telephone allowance can be used to cover the cost of calls or internet usage up to the level of their allowance. In addition if a person wishes to subscribe to a bundled package for telephone and internet, the telephone allowance can be applied to this package.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1709	Preventing long-term unemployment is important from both economic and social perspectives, especially because long-term unemployment tends to lead to erosion of skills and self-confidence, and damages future employment prospects. Effective prevention depends on being able to identify those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed at an early stage, and referring them to appropriate labour market programmes to improve their chances of obtaining employment. This was the motivation for a recently published ESRI report, National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland. ESRI Research Series No. 10, developed a statistical profiling model for Ireland that would identify those individuals with a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed. This model is now being developed in the Department. Implementation will give additional flexibility to target live-register cohorts for activation interventions.There are a number of initiatives being run in my Department which target specific sectors of the unemployed population. The Employer Job (PRSI) Incentive Scheme is focused on creating new jobs for people who have been on the Live Register for 6 months or more. Funding of €169 million has been provided for the Back to Education Allowance Scheme, which supported 20,808 people in the 2009/2010 academic year, for the 2010/11 academic year.The main purpose of the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is  encourage the long term unemployed to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits,  over two years. At the end of August 2010, 6,646 people were availing of the scheme. The Short Term Enterprise Allowance is payable to a person who qualifies for Jobseekers' Benefit and who wishes to commence in self employment. This allowance is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement.  At the end of August 2010, there were 1,558 participants in the scheme.In addition, the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme will be expanded and further developed to give more opportunities to people who are out of work and who want to maintain their skills or improve their job prospects and to create additional work opportunities in the social economy.These schemes and new initiatives compliment and support the National Employment Action Plan, the Government's main welfare to work strategy, which is subject to ongoing development in co-operation with other relevant Government departments.

Westmeath.  The Community Social Services Centre is the operational location for the Department's Disability Activation Project which is funded by the European Social Fund. The premises comprise ground floor offices and a training room and also includes 5 car parking spaces.The lease on the premises commenced on 1 June 2008 and is due to expire on 31 December 2010. The lease is subject to renegotiation after that date. The annual rent amounts to €24,000 per annum.  The Bridgewater Business Centre was originally leased by the Combat Poverty Agency in April 1996 for a period of 21 years. From 1 July 2009, the Combat Poverty Agency integrated with the former Office for Social Inclusion within the Department, to form the new Social Inclusion Division, which subsequently transferred to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs on 1 May 2010.  Staff were relocated from Bridgewater Business Centre in October 2009.The Department has exercised an option to break out of the lease by March 2011, and is currently in the process of applying the necessary measures in order to vacate the property.  The Department pays an annual rent inclusive of car parking of €228,000 for Bridgewater Business Centre, for a space occupation of 7,885 sq. ft. Remaining annual service and utility charges are €50,000 approx.

A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Therefore, the family concerned should apply to be assessed for social housing support, following which they can be considered for rent supplement, if eligible.

Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residency condition (HRC) and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment may qualify for a weekly payment of  SWA.However, subject to the provisions of EU law which apply to EEA workers, SWA cannot at any time be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of HRC, while an applicant awaits the outcome of either a decision — or an appeal against a decision — on a claim for a social welfare payment from DSFA.  The HSE have advised that the person concerned applied for SWA in June 2010 but her application was refused as in the opinion of the HSE, the person concerned was deemed not to be habitually resident based on an assessment of her particular circumstances.The HSE further advised that the person concerned appealed the decision to the HSE Appeals Office in July 2010. The Appeals Office in the HSE upheld the decision to refuse SWA on the basis that the person concerned could not prove habitual residency. An appeal by the person concerned, against the decision to refuse her claim for SWA was forwarded to the Social Welfare Chief Appeals Officer in August 2010. Every effort is being made to have this appeal determined as quickly as possible.The determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.  Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act (amended by Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007) incorporated into Irish law 5 factors that have been set down in judgments given by the European Court of Justice as the main items to be considered in determining habitual residence notwithstanding the presumption in Section  246(1) of the Consolidation Act.Section 246 (1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides that: "it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that a person is not habitually resident in the State at the date of the making of the application concerned unless he has been present in the State or any other part of the Common Travel Area for a continuous period of 2 years ending on that date."Section 30 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 added the following to the above:"(4) Notwithstanding the presumption in subsection (1), a deciding officer or the Executive, when determining whether a person is habitually resident in the State, shall take into consideration all the circumstances of the case including, in particular, the following:a. the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular      country;b. the length and purpose of any absence from the State;c. the nature and pattern of the person's employment;d. the person's main centre of interest, ande. the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances."The presumption in Section 246 does not mean that an applicant is automatically considered to be habitually resident in the State because he or she has been in Ireland (or another part of the Common Travel Area) for 2 years or more. The onus is always on applicants to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims for a social welfare payment.  With regard to the other claims for social welfare payments made by the person concerned the following is a summary of the status of the individual claims:-The application of the person concerned for Carers Allowance was received on 20 August 2010. The application is currently with a Deciding Officer for decision regarding the habitual residence condition.The application of the person concerned for child benefit was received on 1 September 2010. The application is currently with a Deciding Officer for decision regarding the habitual residence condition.The application of the person concerned for domiciliary care allowance was received on 13 July 2010. The application was incomplete and returned to her on 20 July 2010. To date this application has not being returned to the domiciliary care allowance section.The application of the person concerned for disability allowance was received on the 30th July 2010. Her application has been referred to an Investigative Officer for confirmation that all conditions necessary for receipt of this allowance are satisfied.  On completion of the necessary investigations in each individual case a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.

It came to the department's attention that the person was in receipt of farm payments from the Department of Agriculture which she had not disclosed.  The weekly rate of disability allowance depends on the amount of means assessed.  The legislative provisions regarding disability allowance state that means are assessable from all income which the claimant or claimant's spouse or partner may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions.  An income derived from farm subsidies is assessable as means for the purposes of disability allowance.The person concerned was assessed with weekly means of €287.59 with effect from 2 January 2008 derived from farm subsidies which were paid directly into her bank account.  As this amount exceeds the statutory limit for receipt of disability allowance her claim was disallowed with effect from 2 January 2008.  As she had been paid disability allowance in respect of the period 2 January 2008 to 25 May 2010 to which she had no entitlement an overpayment of €25,231.30 was assessed against her.  She was notified of this decision on 17 May 2010 and of her right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The person did not appeal this decision.The Department has written to the person regarding the recovery of the money owed.

Her claim was disallowed on 16th September 2010, on the grounds that she does not satisfy the contribution condition as she only has a total of 193 paid contributions.  In the notification of this decision, the person concerned was advised of her right of appeal to the independent Appeals Office, if she was not satisfied with the outcome of her application.

Where parents are employed in separate member states, Child Benefit is paid by the Member State in which the children are resident.  If the rate of Child Benefit in the other Member State is higher, then that Member State is competent to pay a supplement payment equal to the difference.  Should the situation change, i.e. in this case, should one parent cease employment or move to employment in the other Member State, then competence for payment of Child Benefit would pass to the Member State of employment.For this reason, it is part of the Department's control strategy that letters are issued every four months to this category of customer to reconfirm employment and to ensure that customers are in receipt of the correct entitlements.  There are no plans to change the policy at present.

The Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 provided for the transfer of the administration of the SWA scheme from the HSE to the Department.  These provisions are subject to a Commencement Order.A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed on the transfer. Progress had been stalled due to industrial relations issues but, following the ratification of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions resumed between management and the HSE Unions in the LRC in July 2010 and are ongoing.  It is now hoped that the outstanding matters can be dealt with quickly in the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court, if necessary.Some discussions have also taken place with the civil service unions representing existing staff in the Department. The intention is to complete the discussions with both sets of unions and to finalise the preparatory work as soon as possible. January 2011 remains the target date for the transfer.With regard to the location of Community Welfare Officers, decisions about deployment will take account of the relevant provisions on staff deployment contained in the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.Following the transfer, customers appealing decisions on applications for payments under any part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme will have their appeals dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office. This was provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007. The provision is subject to a Commencement Order.

Given the volume of appeals, it is not possible to estimate the length of time before a case is determined. There are no statistics available on a county basis.During 2009, the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 24 weeks. This represents an increase of 2 weeks in the time taken to process appeals when compared to 2008.   Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings, including allowing sufficient advance notice to the appellant, it is estimated that the average time to finalise an appeal is increased by about 11 weeks when an oral hearing is involved.There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals. In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order. A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented,andSignificant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

Previously, a person who wished to take up a 3rd level course of education could do so after getting a jobseeker or other relevant social welfare payment for 12 months, or 9 months, only if approved by a facilitator of the Department. Since 19th July this period has been set at 9 months for all applicants who are attending 3rd level education (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.Prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA in respect of a 3rd level course if s/he was commencing year one of the course. Since 19th July, a person can avail of BTEA where s/he previously did not complete his/her course and is returning to the second or subsequent year of the 3rd level course. This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of their 3rd level course.  A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her 3rd level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker's payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.  The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.   The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.

In order to qualify for mortgage interest supplement, a person must satisfy a number of statutory qualifying conditions including that the person is not engaged in full-time employment for more than 30 hours per week.Those availing of part-time employment (less than 30 hours a week), community employment, and/or specified training opportunities (including FÁS courses) can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.Arrangements are also in place to allow a person to participate in approved employment or training schemes of more than 30 hours per week or engage in full-time employment and retain entitlement to mortgage interest supplement on a tapered basis for up to 4 years in certain limited circumstances.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1730	During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.  Following this year's Budget, the carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.  Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.  These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.

In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed or they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office within 21 days.In this case the applicant submitted additional medical information in respect of his claim directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and they have registered an appeal.  As part of the appeal process, the application will be reviewed by a Medical Assessor who will take the new medical information into consideration.  If the result of the medical review is that the child is not considered eligible for DCA, the file will be submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office for decision.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant.  Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the HSE that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources. In addition, the HSE must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant and that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined. In such cases, documentation is normally required showing the joint custody arrangement before a decision can be made. The fact that one parent is in receipt of rent supplement would not in itself preclude the other parent from being entitled to assistance towards their rent.

The Department collects these contributions directly, under the provisions of Statutory Instrument 126 of 1998.  Accordingly income derived from such sources is, in general, exempt from income tax but all such income, in excess of €3,174.00 per annum, is liable to PRSI at a rate of 3% subject to a minimum payment of €253.00.  I have not had any discussions with farm organisations in relation to this matter.

Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced a number of changes to improve the delivery of employment, training and community services to the public by bringing together related responsibilities in these areas.  These changes included the restructuring of Departmental responsibilities with the objective of providing a stream-lined response to the income support and job search needs of people who are unemployed.In this context, my Department is currently finalising proposals for the development of new initiatives based on the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme which will offer social employment opportunities. Considerable work is required on these proposals before they come on stream and take their place within the suite of activation measures aimed at supporting unemployed people.  I have not set targets as to how many employment opportunities might be created as much depends on the level of resources that will be available to the Department and the capacity of not-for-profit community based organisations to avail of these emerging opportunities.  Details of the rollout of this initiative will be made available as soon as possible.

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required. Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.  In the case in question an application for Domiciliary Care Allowance was received by the Department on 4th February 2010.  This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that the child in question was not medically eligible for Domiciliary Care Allowance.The person in question was advised of the decision to refuse Domiciliary Care Allowance, on medical criteria grounds, on 8th March 2010.  The person in question lodged an appeal of this decision with the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

His claim was assessed by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that he was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted that medical opinion and further decided that the person in question was not habitually resident in the State.  As he failed to satisfy the medical and habitual residence conditions, his claim was refused.  A letter issued to him on 7th August 2008 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.The person applied again for disability allowance on 27 November 2008.  While the medical assessor gave the opinion that the medical condition was satisfied on the basis of the medical evidence supplied with that application, it was decided that he was not entitled to disability allowance as he did not satisfy the habitual residence condition.  A letter issued to him on 29th January 2009 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.The person subsequently appealed this decision. The Appeals Officer decided that the person was not habitually resident in the State and the appeal was disallowed on 12 August 2009.

The application was approved with effect from the date of receipt.  Following a request to review the decision, the persons' entitlement was backdated six months to 8th October 2009 in line with the scheme's backdating policy.The person concerned was awarded a widow's contributory pension from 24th June 2005.  The normal procedure at that time was to advise the customer that they may qualify for the household benefits scheme on application.  No such application was received from this customer at that time.Provisions for backdating household benefit applications are underpinned by the Social Welfare (Consolidated Payments Provision) (Amendment) (No. 8) (Late Claims) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No.159 of 2000). Under these regulations an application for household benefits package may be backdated for a maximum of six months where there is an underlying entitlement.  There are certain circumstances in which a claim can be backdated for a period in excess of six months including where the person was provided with inaccurate information by the Department, if the delay arose because the person was incapacitated by illness or infirmity or where a person's situation was such that it was impossible to satisfy the requirement of making a claim. None of these type of circumstances applied in this instance.  The Department has no record of any Ombudsman decision in this particular case.

In preparing a recovery plan, the method and rate of recovery is aimed at recovering the overpayment within the shortest time span, taking into account the financial circumstances of the person involved.Overpayments may be recovered by withholding any scheme arrears due to the person, the payment of a single lump sum by the person, the deduction of an agreed amount from ongoing weekly social welfare payments.In the event of the death of a contributory pensioner, who has an outstanding overpayment amount, or who has an overpayment posthumously determined against him/her, under Section 335(a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, there is a liability on the personal representative of the deceased to fully repay the overpayment amount, where there are sufficient assets in the Estate to cover this debt.

To be eligible for disability allowance, a claimant must (inter alia) satisfy a medical examination, a means test and be habitually resident in the state.  The processing time for individual disability allowance claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the three main criteria listed above.  Certain claims have to be referred to Social Welfare Inspectors for means investigation and this can add to the overall processing times.  In addition, factors outside the department's control can have an impact, for example, the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers or other third parties.  In the meantime, people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) and, last month, 94% of basic SWA applications were decided on and paid within a week.The department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed in all areas of the department, including disability allowance section, to ensure that claims are processed and decided in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.

It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.One of the key elements of the framework is the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system and this will have implications for self-employed people who employ staff, unless they already have more favourable pension arrangements in place.  Employees earning above a certain income threshold will be automatically enrolled into this new scheme, unless they are already in a more favourable occupational pension scheme.For those employees who are included in the scheme, contributions will only be paid on earnings above a certain minimum level and below a certain maximum.  The level of these thresholds will be decided closer to the implementation date and they will be set in such a way as to ensure that the scheme focuses on those on low and middle incomes.  Within these thresholds, the employee will pay 4% of their salary and the employer will be required to pay a contribution of 2%.  The State will also provide a contribution within these thresholds which will be equivalent to 33% tax relief.  It is intended that the auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced in 2014 but the Government will review the introduction date depending on the prevailing economic conditions closer to the time.Self-employed people pay PRSI at Class S and so the changes to the State pension (contributory) which are set out in the framework may have implications for them, depending on their age.  The framework provides for State pension age to be standardised at age 66 in 2014 and to increase to 68 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  From 2020, a total contributions approach will be introduced to replace the current averaging system which is used in calculating a person's eligibility for State pension.  In addition, consideration is being given to allowing people to postpone receiving State pension beyond pension age and to make up contribution shortfalls.  The current homemakers' disregard will be replaced with a system of credited contributions from 2012.There are a number of other elements of the framework which may have implications for self-employed people depending on their pension arrangements.  Currently, tax relief on pension contributions is at the standard and higher rates.  This will be replaced by a State contribution equal to 33% tax relief.  Arrangements for the tax treatment of pension lump sums greater than €200,000 will be considered and developed during the implementation of the framework.The framework also includes a commitment to streamline existing options at retirement so that all those with a defined contribution pension will have access to similar options at retirement.  In addition, the range of personal pension vehicles available will be reviewed with a view to rationalising provision in this area.  Regulations will be introduced to increase the transparency of pension charges and the Pensions Board's powers in relation to the regulation of pension schemes will be reviewed.  The information being provided to scheme members will be kept under review and enhanced as considered necessary.A technical implementation group was established in May to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms into operation.  In line with the Government decision, the group is chaired by the Department of Social Protection.  The implementation phase is expected to take three to five years.

Section 3 of the Act extends the definition of spouse to include divorced persons and persons who are cohabiting as husband and wife.  An increase for a qualified adult is also payable under certain conditions in respect of a person over the age of 16 who is wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant and has the care of one or more qualified child.Social welfare legislation does not include any discrimination on the basis of race, nationality or citizenship.  The habitual residence condition applies only to specified assistance and child benefit claims and does not extend to the provisions regarding an increase for a qualified adult.

It is estimated that it will spend over €8.3 billion in 2010 on means tested schemes. These schemes are administered through a network of local offices, central and decentralised offices and in the case of supplementary welfare allowance through the offices of the community welfare officers.The means of a claimant are established following an assessment of the claimant's financial position. This may be carried out at the relevant scheme office and, in some cases, may involve referral to a social welfare inspector to carry out a home visit.  The means are determined by the deciding officer of the Department and as appropriate are used to adjust the amount of the payment, if any, a claimant will receive, subject to all the other conditions of the scheme being satisfied.During 2009, over 370,000 claims of various types were finalised where a means test was part of the process. Nearly 260,000 such claims have already been finalised to end-August 2010. In addition Community Welfare officers processed 698,000 claims during 2009 and a further 531,000 claims in the year to date.The initial means assessment and the ongoing review of means is an integral part of the processing and maintenance of claims. It is not possible to disaggregate the specific administration costs relating to means testing as it forms just one element of determining entitlement to a specific payment and, in many cases, the staff who administer these schemes in social welfare local offices or as part of the departmental inspectorate are also simultaneously administering other schemes, including schemes which do not have a means tested element.

The expenditure for this scheme shown in the table above includes €62,226,000 (or 6% of total expenditure) in 2009 and €33,544,000 (or 5.8%) in the year to July 2010 paid to the HSE to cover administration costs. In addition, my department incurred €922,000 expenditure on policy and administration of SWA in 2009.  The direct costs of administering the child benefit scheme in 2009 were €5.53 million.Jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit are part of the People of Working Age programme operated by my Department. The financial information in relation to this programme is published in the Annual Output Statement, 2010 which details both programme and administration expenditure as follows:2009 Provisional Outturn2010 REV Estimate€ Millions€ MillionsProgramme Expenditure Current7,705.08,221.9

It is not possible to disaggregate the specific administration costs relating to jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit because the staff who administer these schemes in social welfare local offices and as part of the departmental inspectorate are also simultaneously administering other schemes such as one parent family payment, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance.Other costs arising from the administration of jobseeker's benefit and allowance, child benefit and supplementary welfare allowance are also incurred. These relate to the department's information technology infrastructure and central support services such as accounts, personnel, information and senior management are accounted for under the Operational Capabilities programme of the annual output statement. These costs are controlled at a business process level and are not analysed at individual scheme level.

The number of families benefiting increased from 79,000 in 2006 to almost 140,000 in 2009.  Given the increased income thresholds and the increase in the Live Register, it is estimated that 340,000 children and 170,000 families will benefit from the scheme in 2010.Expenditure on the scheme has increased since 2006 from €23m to €67.2m in 2009. The financial provision for 2010 is €82.8m.Statistics are not available on the number of one-parent family payment recipients on community employment schemes that are not in receipt of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.

In the 2010/2011 heating season it is estimated that over 340,000 recipients will benefit from the allowance at a cost of over €231million.Statistics are not available on the number of one-parent family payment recipients on community employment schemes that are not in receipt of the fuel allowance.People in receipt of short-term social welfare payments such as jobseekers benefit, jobseekers allowance, illness benefit, supplementary welfare allowance, occupational injuries benefit or maternity benefit are not normally eligible to receive a fuel allowance.  However, there is a special arrangement in place to pay the smokeless fuel allowance element (€3.90 per week) to people who live in one of the designated urban smokeless fuel areas and who have been receiving either jobseekers benefit, jobseekers allowance or illness benefit for 13 weeks or more.There are approximately 28,000 family income supplement (FIS) recipients and 380,000 short term social welfare recipients at present.  If all of these were eligible for a fuel allowance payment, the additional annual cost would be in excess of €260 million. It is, however, likely that not all of these recipients would qualify for a fuel allowance as the payment is means tested and only one payment is allowable per household.

Those availing of part-time employment (less than 30 hours a week), community employment, and/or specified training opportunities can continue to receive rent supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules. Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.The current average rent supplement payment to those whose primary social welfare payment is the one-parent family payment (including those who are also in receipt of wages from community employment, part-time earnings, maintenance etc.) is €143.14 per week. Statistics are not available on the number of one-parent family payment recipients on community employment schemes that are not in receipt of rent supplement or are in receipt of a reduced rate rent supplement payment or the average rent supplement payable for these customers.

I have had enquiries made with the Registrar General and he has informed me that the position is as follows:The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or such a system that applied to such a death, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death.Where an Irish citizen dies abroad and the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, a certified copy of the death registration, translated, if necessary, is sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and there is no necessity for the event to be entered in the register of deaths in the State. However, it is appreciated that registration here of the deaths abroad of Irish citizens would be very significant to the relatives of the deceased and it is in this context that a commitment has been made to review the existing provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, in relation to this issue.There are a range of issues to be considered in relation to the scope and implementation of any proposed amendment on this matter. Some of these issues may have cross-departmental implications and these need to be considered also.The general review of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The review will include the provisions relating to the registration of deaths.

Participants in the back to education allowance scheme transfer from another social welfare payment.  Because these claims are not recorded as a separate scheme until the person transfers from their primary payment to the back to education scheme, statistics are not available on the number of applications received or refused entry to the scheme. Accordingly, the number of applications refused the back to education allowance on the basis of non-progression is also not available.At end of August, 2010 a total of 3,985 participants were approved for the back to education allowance. Due to the nature of the scheme, the majority of the applications are made in late August and September in advance of the commencement of the new academic year.

Medical Assessors carry out desk assessments of medical evidence/ reports supplied by doctors/patients and where required, conduct in person assessments in order to provide a second medical opinion for the guidance of Deciding and Appeals Officers. All guidelines are carried out in accordance with the accepted guidelines of the Irish Medical Council.The vast majority of illness related claims pertain to the Illness Benefit scheme for those initially presenting with a short term illness. Illness Benefit claimants are normally first assessed by a Medical Assessor at a desk assessment (without meeting the claimant) based on the perusal of a medical report from the claimant's doctor. In these desk assessments, the Medical Assessor cannot recommend refusal of Benefit, but can recommend eligibility for benefit or that the claimant should be assessed in person by a Medical assessor to ascertain eligibility for continued entitlement to Illness Benefit. At the in-person assessment, the Medical Assessor may present an opinion to a Deciding Officer in the scheme area who then makes the decision on eligibility.  Applicants who wish to claim Disablement Benefit in respect of an injury obtained at work, are normally assessed by a Medical Assessor at an in-person assessment to determine the loss of function involved.Applicants for other schemes such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Carers Allowance/Benefit, and Respite Care Allowance are generally assessed by a Medical Assessor at desk, based on medical reports and medical evidence submitted by the patient's doctor/specialist. The Medical Assessor presents his/her opinion from the assessment for the guidance of the Deciding Officers in the scheme areas. In certain cases if warranted, the Medical Assessor can recommend that the patient undergo an in person assessment.

Subject to satisfying all of the conditions of the scheme, persons with a disability can be paid the Allowance on reaching the age of 16.Following on the implementation of progressive legislative changes to the scheme since it was first introduced in 1996, entitlement to Disability Allowance is not affected by the claimant's place of residency.The issue of whether claimants in residential care, whether in secure children's units or in other long-term residential institutions, may be required to make a contribution to the costs of that care, is a matter for the Health Services Executive and for the Minister for Health and Children.

Any changes to social protection schemes generally, including changes recommended by the Special Group, will fall to be considered later this year in a Budgetary context and in the context of continuing to reduce overall public expenditure and restoring stability to the public finances.The Government has already made difficult decisions in this regard and the next steps towards recovery will require further such decisions. At the moment, I am engaged in an intensive round of consultations with a wide range of welfare representative organisations and I am listening carefully to their views. In an uncertain international environment, my priority will be to ensure that the overall Government strategy is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead. It is important to stress that, at this stage, no decisions have been taken either by me or by the Government with regard to the forthcoming budget.

If people do not attend for an EAP interview or, having engaged with FÁS, decline offers of employment or training, their cases are referred back to the social welfare local office for review to determine if they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  Jobseekers who, for valid reasons, are unable to avail of the opportunities provided by FÁS, continue to receive payment.  In such cases, the Department's facilitator service is available to assist them in identifying barriers to participation in employment and exploring alternative progression routes.The Department refer people that have been through the EAP process to facilitators on a monthly basis.  In the period September 2008 to end-August 2010 (the period for which figures are available), over 39,000 cases were referred to facilitators.  There are 63 facilitators located throughout the country and are assigned to cover defined geographical areas.As part of the normal control process, a future review date is entered on the payment system for all jobseeker customers. Additional review dates are entered as necessary throughout the life of the claim. At each date, the claim is reviewed and where necessary the claimant is interviewed to ensure that they continue to satisfy the conditions of the scheme.

The system used to make jobseekers payments only records the current claim while previous claims for the same person are archived.  A complete claim history for each individual is not readily available and could only be produced by accessing each customer's and former customer's record on the system individually.  If there has been a break in claim and the claim was closed, for whatever reason, the system will only record the current claim.  An example of such cases would be where a claimant exhausts their Jobseeker's Benefit after 12 months and moves directly to Jobseeker's Allowance.The following table is based on live claims at 25th September 2010 and only takes the current claim into account.Duration in YearsNumberLess than 1234,922Between 1 and 2110,973Between 2 and 333,653Between 3 and 414,597Between 4 and 59,267Between 5 and 66,764Between 6 and 74,954Between 7 and 83,671Between 8 and 92,658Between 9 and 102,006

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1837	Operational responsibility for tourism marketing rests with the tourism agencies. Tourism Ireland has promoted the Shannon Airport Catchment Area vigorously and extensively in recent years through its ongoing global marketing activity and through specific, additional campaigns undertaken for the region in the United States and Great Britain. The cross-sectoral Shannon Airport Catchment Economic and Tourism Development Plan made a commitment in 2008 to provide marketing support for a transitional period for tourism into the wider region for which Shannon Airport has been the main gateway, in the face of changes then under way on air travel on North Atlantic routes.The "Discover Ireland's Wonderful West" campaign commenced in 2008 following close collaboration between Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and a Tourism Working Group was formed for this purpose.  €3m was provided specifically for this initiative when it commenced in 2008 in addition to funding of €1.05 million provided for the parallel Super Region West Coast campaign.In 2009, Tourism Ireland re-aligned its Super Region marketing initiative overseas, in particular its West Coast region, to ensure it supported and added value to the Shannon Airport Catchment Area programme. As a result, in 2009 the campaign was refreshed to "Ireland's Wonderful West Awaits You" with a total provision of €2.9 million for marketing the Shannon Catchment.  An identical amount of €2.9 million has been provided for 2010 for marketing the Super Region West Coast including additional funding provision for the promotion of the wider Shannon Airport Catchment, over and above the funding for promotion of the regions generally. This has allowed Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to continue to mount a similar level of focused, promotional marketing for the Shannon region in 2010, in cooperation with local tourism interests, including Shannon Development.In terms of the actual marketing programmes undertaken, ease of direct access from key gateway cities, the many highlights of the region, the good value fares and inclusive packages available, as well as a range of compelling offers from local industry are showcased in the campaigns.  Business Tourism, a highly valuable segment which can deliver high-spending visitors year round, is also a feature of the marketing programmes.

Since 1998 grants to the value of €730m have been allocated to some 7,400 projects nationwide.  No decision has been made on the timing of the next round of the Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1839	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1389, 1390, 1392, 1394 to 1396, inclusive, and 1409 together.Since 2006 my Department has invested over €962m in the arts, culture and film sectors and the allocations for each year are shown in the following tabular statement.I am committed to supporting the crucial constituent sectors of arts and culture and the Government will continue to fund those sectors within limited available financial resources.  Decisions regarding funding, whether within my Department's Vote or on the part of other relevant Departments will, however, have to be taken in the context of the ongoing Estimates and budget preparation process and in the light of the target aggregate Exchequer savings to be achieved for 2011.  In this context, I should like to acknowledge the concerns raised by the recent Campaign for the Arts and to reaffirm my commitment to maximising the place and status of the arts in society.My policy on the arts, culture and film sectors reflects Government Policy in this area as set out in the Programme for Government.  This policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism.  I will endeavour to maximise funding for these sectors, commensurate with their centrality to our economic and social well being.Subhead20062007200820092010€000s€000s€000s€000s€000sD1National Archives3754415266D2National Archives1,6191,7512,1531,8131,654National Archives1,6561,8052,1941,8651,720D3IMMA8,8358,2728,2417,3176,671D3Chester Beatty Library3,0833,2083,4593,0832,714D3National Concert Hall3,9274,0903,8943,4783,105D3Crawford Gallery1,1741,9801,9881,7531,579D4Cultural Projects7,0986,6806,9745,3174,420D5Cultural Infrastructure20,34638,09435,02117,84216,491D6Culture Ireland2,3274,2024,7484,5504,083D7Arts Council82,31083,00081,62073,35068,649D8National Museum19,84218,33219,01715,41515,125D9National Library11,81712,70211,87510,7429,348D10Irish Film Board19,42622,15923,18920,34019,272Total Vote 35181,842204,523202,219165,052153,177V33National Gallery — Vote 339,35112,61112,46610,90310,416

Activities in this area include the promotion of cultural activities, attractions and events, as well as workshops and development activity with the cultural tourism sector. Some examples include:significant development of certain key areas of cultural strength, such as the Aran Islands and Dingle Peninsula, as cultural tourism destinations and the development of heritage themed consumer experiences;upgrade of cultural tourism attractions such as Russborough House as well as development of new heritage attractions e.g. Waterford Viking Triangle;the production of guidelines for Historic Towns on how to maximise their tourism potential;the rolling-out in 2011 by Fáilte Ireland of the national crafts tourism quality framework coinciding with ‘The Year of the Craft 2011' andfrom October 2010 a weekly Discover Ireland Ciné-Café in Bewleys on Grafton Street will bring the best of Irish short film to the attention of visitors.My Department is also involved directly in a number of measures, including most recently Culture Night 2010, which assist the promotion of Ireland as a location for cultural activities, thus increasing its attractiveness as a destination for cultural tourism.In addition, to encourage the deployment of information and communications technologies and modern communications tools in the promotion of arts, culture and cultural tourism, I launched a Cultural Technology scheme earlier this summer.  Applications are currently being assessed and I hope to announce the successful projects in this round in coming weeks.

The allocation to the Arts Council for 2010 is €68.6m from which the Arts Council may provide funding to local authorities towards the arts.My Department is responsible for the provision of capital monies for the arts such as arts centres, galleries and theatres.  Under the ACCESS 11 programme, funding has been provided for around 80 projects.  Some of these were local authority lead projects and the table below shows the total funding allocated under the ACCESS programme to local authorities during the period 2005-2010.YearFunding Allocated to Local Authorities for Arts Capital Projects€200540,00020076,785,00020084,300,0002009Nil*2010Ni*Total11,125,000*No ACCESS programme allocation in these years.There are other projects supported by local authorities but which were not local-authority-lead projects.  A list of the successful ACCESS II projects and the amount of grant aid allocated to each project is available on my Department's website.The increase in the availability of facilities and the enhancement of their quality, as a result of the arts capital schemes, has greatly improved access to and participation in the arts for a great many people.Funding for the arts for 2011 will be decided in the context of the ongoing Estimates process.

As the Deputy will appreciate the use of mobile phones is vital to the effective operation of the Department which has decentralised to Killarney as staff can be in contact while travelling between the offices in Killarney and Dublin, between meetings and, of course, outside of normal office hours.Vodafone is the mobile phone operator currently contracted to supply service to both the Departmental headquarters and the National Archives. The current contract in respect of the Departmental headquarters was agreed in August 2009 while the National Archives contract was agreed in March 2010. Both contracts were agreed following completion of a competitive tendering process carried out under the Mobile Voice and Data Services Framework.

While any decrease is disappointing, it must be viewed in the context of a decline in tourist numbers internationally.  Tourism worldwide has been deeply affected by global economic difficulties and loss of consumer confidence.  Furthermore, the exceptional weather conditions in the early part of the year and the closure of airports in April and May due to the volcanic ash cloud meant that it was inevitable that a falloff in the numbers of people travelling would be experienced in the first half of 2010.I acknowledge the concern among many in the tourism industry that the Air Travel Tax could potentially affect the competitiveness and viability of routes to and from Ireland. The Department is monitoring trends and assessing information in relation to the impact of the departure tax on routes. The Government will be making decisions on all taxation matters as part of the wider deliberations on the Budget, having regard to the general national fiscal situation.

The Code of Practice for Safety at Sports Grounds, together with international best practice, provide comprehensive guidelines in relation to how this responsibility should be effectively managed.Issues related to crowd safety in general are governed by legislative provisions operating under the aegis of my colleagues including the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Health and Children; and Justice and Law Reform as well as the relevant statutory authorities.The GAA is best positioned to identify the safety issues involved with Croke Park.  I have advised the GAA to ensure that any work undertaken in this area is in compliance with existing legislation and best practice in this area and that the organisation works in tandem with the relevant authorities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1847	The current staffing of my constituency office is as follows:1 Personal Assistant at HEO level2 Executive Officers1 Staff Officer1 Personal Secretary at Secretarial Assistant levelAll of these staff are paid at normal civil service rates applicable to these grades. In addition, my Personal Secretary is paid an attraction allowance of 10% of salary. To date since my appointment as Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport no expenses have been paid to any of these staff.   The staffing of my constituency office adheres to Department of Finance guidelines on these matters.All the above staff are based at my Department's office at Kildare Street Dublin 2. The current office space assigned to the staff in my constituency office is estimated at 657 square feet. As the Department's offices are owned by the Office of Public Works I am not in a position to give an estimated value of this office space. Neither is it possible to provide an estimated cost of the provision of utilities, services and other miscellaneous costs to the office since records are not maintained on a basis that would allow such a breakdown.The Constituency Office Staff of former Minister Martin Cullen immediately prior to his resignation as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism were as follows:1 Staff Officer1 Personal Assistant at HEO level1 Constituency Assistant at HEO level1 Personal Secretary.Of these his Personal Assistant, Constituency Assistant and Personal Secretary were located at his Waterford office.Again all of these staff were paid at the normal civil service rates applicable and his personal secretary was paid an additional allowance of 10% of his salary.The expenses paid to Minister Cullen's constituency office staff in 2010 was €816.15 in total.The cost of the constituency office in terms of salary costs and expenses for the former Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for years 2008, 2009 and from 14 June to the end of 2007 is set out in the table:YearSalary costsExpenses  paidTotal2007 (June –Dec)89,000Nil89,0002008261,0004,000265,0002009218,8104,769223,579The staffing of the Minister's constituency office in the former Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for year end 2007 to 2009 was as follows:Constituency Office Staff 20070.8 Executive Officer1 Staff Officer2 Clerical Officers1 Personal Assistant at HEO level1 Personal SecretaryConstituency Office Staff 20081 Staff Officer1 Clerical Officer1 Personal Secretary1 Personal Assistant at HEO level1 Constituency Assistant at HEO levelConstituency Office Staff 20091 Staff Officer1 Personal Assistant at HEO level1 Constituency Assistant at HEO level1 Personal SecretaryThe Minister of State at my Department, Mr Martin Mansergh, T.D, does not have constituency office facilities at my Department's offices.

These were prepared and exhibited extensively in the late 1990s, and have been exhibited more occasionally since then."A Nation and not a Rabble" —  Ireland in the year July 1921 — June 1922"The Calamitous Fire" — the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland, June 1922"Lovers of Liberty?"  —  100 years of Local Government in IrelandIn recent years the limited resources available to the National Archives for outreach have been concentrated mainly on the development of its website and the digital publication of the 1901 and 1911 Census Returns.  In addition to the Census Returns themselves, the website includes extensive contextual material, describing life in early 20th century Ireland, supported by many photographs illustrating life at the time.  The inclusion of the contextual material is particularly helpful to teachers using this resource in the classroom, and the website is proving very popular in secondary school history classes. The resources available to the National Archives preclude an expansion of its outreach service for the present.

I note that NAMA has recently appointed a senior official to help deal with this aspect of its loan portfolio. I intend to meet NAMA over the coming weeks to discuss overall policy in relation to the tourism industry, but not specific cases.In regard to the actions of banks, Section 66(1)(a) of the NAMA Act, 2009 was included to ensure that applicant institutions continue to service loans in the same manner as a prudent lender.  If the Deputy, or anybody else, is aware of any specific instances where participating institutions in NAMA are not adhering to the requirement of the Act they should bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Finance.

The detailed administration of the scheme, including the assessment and approval of applications and the payment of grants to individual applicants, is the responsibility of the local authority concerned.

Insofar as the transport sector is concerned, while early indicators suggest that consumption of motor fuels is still falling, data over a number of years would be required to provide a full analysis. The impact of other policy changes, such as rates of VRT and Motor Tax, would also have to be factored into any such analysis of transport emissions.  Investment in more efficient capital stock is strongly incentivised by carbon taxes, but these changes take place over much longer time frames than a single year.

These draft Guidelines are aimed at ensuring that roads planning and policy, and development planning and management processes are appropriately and effectively aligned, in order to guide development to the most suitable locations to maximise the investment in the national roads network, while also encouraging a shift towards more sustainable forms of travel and transport.Section 3.7 of the draft Guidelines outlines the legislative provisions concerning the erection of authorised advertising structures / signage, other than road traffic signs, namely that:A licence is required under section 254 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 for a structure on, under, over or along a public road;Consent of the relevant road authority under section 71(1)(b) of the Roads Act 1993, is required for structures / signage on a public road; andPlanning permission under section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is required for both temporary and permanent signage on private property, including in fields adjacent to motorways and national roads, and must be carefully designed in accordance with the standards of the local authority and the national roads authority, as appropriate.While my Department will give further consideration to the matter of signage in finalising the Guidelines having regard to the submissions received under the consultation process (which closes on 30 September), the practice of parking large truck trailers off the road as a means of displaying advertising hoardings should be carefully monitored by planning authorities and enforcement steps taken as necessary under planning and other legislative codes.

A new requirement was introduced for the financial year 2008 to include details in the annual financial statement of all accrued uncollected levies due to the planning authority.The total debtor's figures supplied by the Local Authorities to the end of year 2008 amounted to €499 million. Information on the amount of development contributions due to planning authorities to the end of year 2009 will be available in March 2011, following a full audit by the Local Government Audit Service during the audit cycle 2010-2011.Under the Planning Acts, the role of the Minister is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures. Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt.

The Letterkenny Sewerage Scheme is included in the Programme with the treatment plant amongst the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010-2012, and a further network scheme to advance through planning in this period.Earlier in 2010, I gave approval for funding to allow Donegal County Council to award the contract at a value of €25.87m for the wastewater treatment plant for the Letterkenny Sewerage Scheme.  The contract will be funded on a shared basis between my Department and Donegal County Council but the exact amounts have yet to be determined.

The charge is set at €200 per dwelling and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  While the legislation makes no provision for any waiver of the charge or of any penalties due, section 9 of the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of the relevant local authority.I have no plans at present to amend the legislation.

While the sale of the affordable units on hand remains the preferred outcome, local authorities have available to them a range of options to bring these units into use and are supported in this regard by my Department and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.I have no immediate plans to introduce a general rent-to-buy scheme across all local authorities because I do not believe such a scheme is needed in areas where there are only very small numbers of unsold units on hand. However, Dublin City Council, following approval by my Department, has recently launched a pilot scheme of "Rent to Buy" for a number of unsold affordable homes in three developments in Dublin City.  I have asked Dublin City Council to prepare and submit a report on the operation of the pilot before the end of this year.  This pilot will be reviewed before deciding whether it is appropriate to make such a scheme available in any other local authorities where there are significant numbers of unsold affordable homes.

They have been breeding in the countryside since the 1950s and are now found throughout much of the country.A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated that the potential population of wild mink in the State was between 20,500 and 33,500 individuals.  The report identified ground nesting birds as the species most vulnerable to mink predation.  Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species including red-throated diver, corncrake, grey partridge, waders and terns from a range of predators including mink.  Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these species.  This year some €50,000 will be spent on this work.As wild mink are not protected under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 they can be controlled by landowners and their agents.

An audit committee, with both councillor and expert external membership, is now in place in each county and city council and will further enhance financial management practices in local government.Each Local Authority is required to prepare and publish a financial statement in respect of each financial year.  These financial statements are audited by the Local Government Audit Service which provides an independent and professional public sector audit service to the Local Government sector.My Department continues to work closely with local authorities on all matters relating to local government finances.

Details of property rented directly are set out as follows.The Department, at the end of 2009, entered into an arrangement whereby its National Monuments Service will occupy a proportion of an archival and storage facility as a sub-lessee of the National Museum of Ireland.  This shared arrangement, in optimal accommodation and environmental conditions, will ensure satisfactory long-term preservation and protection of a range of valuable archaeological materials of common interest to both bodies. The Department's share of the rental costs, amounting to €105,000 for the period to the end of 2011, was paid to the National Museum of Ireland in December 2009.  The Department's share of the running costs is likely to be in the order of €70,000 for 2011.  Costs are allocated on the basis of floor space, with the National Monuments Service occupying 2,782 m2, which is 14% of the overall space.  The terms of the sub-lease are currently being finalised and the National Monuments Service is currently in the process of moving archaeological material into the facility.The Department pays €25,350 annually in rent and ancillary costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of its share of a premises occupied by Ireland's Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels.  The costs are apportioned between relevant Departments on the basis of staff numbers assigned to the Representation and my Department does not hold records relating to the building size or the terms of the lease.Met Éireann rents premises from Dublin Airport Authority at Dublin and Shannon Airports. Annual rental and service charge costs are approximately €45,521 and €17,864 respectively for an area of €130.6 m2 at Dublin Airport and €87,564 and €44,219 respectively for an area of 364.33 m2 at Shannon.  Non-office space is also rented at Cork Airport with an annual rent of €1,239.  No car parking is allocated in any of the locations.   None of the aforementioned space is currently unoccupied.The Department is also renting storage space in Galway and Cork.  The costs associated with Galway are €1,200 per annum for the rental of a small storage unit, while the rental cost for the space in Cork, which is 520.26 m2, is €21,870.

Under the terms of the Habitats Directive, any proposed project likely to have a significant effect on the site must be subject to appropriate assessment. This is provided for in the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997. This assessment must be undertaken by the relevant consent authority. This is the planning authority, in a case where planning permission is being sought, or my Department as the competent authority where proposed works on such a site are considered to be a notifiable activity.My Department recently met with the owner of the lands in question and has explained the situation.

The primary objective of water conservation is to reduce water loss in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address unacceptably high levels of unaccounted for water.  Local authorities are required to give top priority to water conservation works as an alternative to new infrastructure provision.Mains rehabilitation is an integral part of local authority water conservation strategies, whereby water distribution pipelines are relined or replaced, and is a key priority under the 2010-2012 Programme.  Last year, at my Department's request, local authorities carried out assessments of needs to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works, including mains rehabilitation works, in their areas.In their needs assessments, local authorities identified mains rehabilitation works with a value of some €320 million which have been included in the new Programme as contracts due to commence over the period of the Programme.  Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  Over time, this investment should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and progress will continue to be monitored on an annual basis through the local authority service indicator process.

Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes, or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate document. In circumstances where an RF111A Goods Only Declaration is required, an income tax registration number is now routinely sought.It is not expected that any person genuinely using a vehicle in the course of trade or business should have a difficulty supplying documentation to support a claim for what is, in effect, a concessionary rate of motor tax.

Furthermore, the County Meath Heritage Plan 2007-2011 also includes an action to seek to pilot the development and adoption of a Landscape Conservation Area.The making, reviewing and varying of a development plan is a reserved function of the elected members of the planning authority for the area. Equally, the adoption of individual landscape conservation areas is also a reserved function and it is a matter for the members to make, modify or refuse to make an order under section 204 of the Planning and Development Acts.Before making an order under section 204, the Planning Authority must consult with any State authority, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, where it considers that any order relates to the functions of a State authority.The Planning Acts also provide that, notwithstanding the exempted development set out under section 4 of the Planning Acts, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may prescribe development, for the purpose of section 204, which shall not be exempted development.

The Green Paper on Local Government, published in early 2008, outlined the various options in regard to the establishment of the office, its functions and responsibilities. Consultation both preceded and followed the Green Paper's publication. In February 2010 the general scheme of the mayoral legislation was published on my Department's website. My Department has also been engaging with the four Dublin local authorities in relation to preparations for the introduction of the Mayor.The development of the mayoral legislation has been steadily pursued since publication of the general scheme.  Government has approved the text of the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010, and the presentation of the Bill which will occur very shortly. Elections will follow as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill.

The Loughrea Water Treatment Plant element of the Loughrea Regional Water Supply Scheme is included amongst the list of schemes in the county to advance through planning during the period of this Programme.Galway County Council submitted a revised Preliminary Report for the overall Loughrea Regional Water Supply Scheme to the Department in February 2010.  As part of my Department's ongoing assessment of this Report, my Department is also examining Galway County Council's most recent cost estimates for its proposals to provide a water supply from Loughrea to Kilreekil which were submitted in August 2010.A decision on the Report, including the cost estimates, will be conveyed to the Council as soon as possible.  However, it should be noted that, although upgrading the treatment plant is a pre-requisite to providing a water supply to Kilreekil village, the Council's proposals to connect Kilreekil to the Loughrea Regional Water Supply Scheme are not part of this project at this time.I have included a review process as one of a number of new measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, under which the Programme will be reviewed and updated annually to allow for any re-prioritisation required.  The format and timing of the review process has still to be decided by my Department.  When finalised, it will be a matter for Galway County Council to decide whether to submit the trunk main to Kilreekil element of the Loughrea Regional Water Supply Scheme to my Department for consideration for inclusion in the new Programme.Insofar as the Kilreekil Group Water Scheme is concerned, responsibility for the administration of the Rural Water Programme, which includes funding for group water schemes, has been devolved to local authorities since 1997.  The advancement of individual group schemes under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant funding provided, is, therefore, a matter for the relevant local authority i.e. Galway County Council in this case.

Section 14 of the Act sets out the eligibility criteria for registration in the statutory register of architects. It also includes a provision to address the position of practically trained persons in that it includes a category for those who have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure, that is practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, which is designated as registration body for Architects under the Building Control Act 2007, has established an Admissions Board and a Technical Assessment Board so that the registration process may commence in the near future. The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards and I have appointed the Chairpersons and non-architect majority to both boards. Section 22 of the Act sets out the procedures for the operation of the Technical Assessment Board.The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the Technical Assessment Board to an Appeals Board which will be appointed shortly. The Appeals Board will also have an independent Chairperson and a majority of lay members. An appeal to the High Court can also ultimately be made against a decision of the Appeals Board or any other Board or Committee.I have no plans to amend the Building Control Act 2007 at present.  Much time and effort has gone into the design and implementation of the statutory registration process and I believe that, once fully operational, the merits of the process will become evident.

The European Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice to Ireland on 3 June 2010 for not meeting these deadlines.At the date of receipt of the letter, the process of adoption of the plans was well advanced and has since been finalised.  A response to the letter issued on 28 July 2010, confirming that plans for all 7 river basin districts were completed and published on 6 July.As the obligation to publish and report the plans has now been met, I expect that the European Commission will close the infringement proceedings shortly.

This ambitious programme of new projects was identified following consideration of each proposal received, the relative priority afforded to the projects by the local authorities concerned and the competing demands across all local authorities.The project in question, twenty units for older people at Killavullen, Co. Cork, was not included in the overall programme for 2010 primarily because it was not afforded a sufficiently high priority by Cork County Council.  It remains a matter for Cork County Council to submit it as a priority project under any future call for proposals for new construction projects. The more recent call for proposals was a special measure to facilitate the voluntary and co-operative sector in taking advantage of favourable market conditions and to purchase newly built properties or properties nearing completion.  As a new construction project, these twenty houses at Killavullen do not fall into this category.  Having regard to then available resources, I expect to issue a further call for new construction projects in 2011 at which time Cork County Council may wish to submit the project concerned for consideration.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.The Report of the independent Local Government Efficiency Review Group, published in mid July, includes 106 recommendations for efficiency and other savings of €511m for the local government sector to be attained in the short, medium and long terms.  These savings are comprised of €346m in efficiencies and €165m in improved cost recovery and revenue raising. The Group's focus was on removing costs in the local government sector and to ensure that efforts are directed towards improving and extending the delivery of local public services in the most efficient and effective way. The Report's findings and recommendations will be considered as necessary by Government in the appropriate policy and financial contexts.As recommended in the Report, I propose to establish an implementation group with an independent chairperson to oversee implementation of relevant recommendations.

The licence states that it does not authorise any person to enter on any land without the permission of the owner or occupier of the land.   Under the Wildlife Acts my Department can initiate prosecutions against Coursing Clubs where there is evidence that they have entered on lands to capture hares without the permission of the owner or occupier of the land.My Department is currently investigating a number of allegations in relation to the unlawful capturing of hares by coursing clubs during the 2009-2010 season.

Proposals are being developed by my Department on the approach to be taken to the installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies, including households in apartment blocks and other multi-occupancy buildings. The proposals will take account of international practice in relation to metering.The costs of installing meters in the Dublin city area, like in other local authority areas, will depend on a number of factors including the costs of the meters, the tender proposals that are received during the procurement process and the number of properties which had meter boxes installed during construction.  These factors will vary the costs of metering both within and across local authorities.

To this end, they have been given substantial powers under the Act in relation to any such sites, including powers to require specified measures to be taken in relation to a derelict site, to impose a levy on derelict sites, or to compulsorily acquire any derelict site. I expect local authorities to use their statutory powers as they consider appropriate.Building Regulations generally apply to the construction of a new building, to the extension and material alteration of an existing building and to the material change of use of an existing building.  Where a building control authority, Galway County Council in this case, considers that construction works or a change of use coming within the scope of the Building Regulations may give rise to a risk to the health and safety of persons who may be in or about the building or works, it may apply (under section 12 of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007) to the High Court or Circuit Court for an order requiring the following:the removal, alteration or making safe of any structure, service, fitting or equipment; orthe discontinuance of any works; orthe restriction or prohibition of the use of the building until any of the above requirements has been effected.Enforcement of the Building Regulations is the responsibility of Galway County Council as the Building Control Authority for the area.I understand from Galway County Council, that as the related planning permission for the development has expired, a re-inspection of the site will be carried out by a Planning Enforcement Officer as soon as possible.

In general, the Authority has funded its operations and social regeneration agenda through its property development functions.However, some €5.4m was allocated the Authority, in the form of site subsidies for affordable housing, during the period 2007-2010, with annual payments set out in the following table:YearFunding2007€4.15m2008€1.05m2009€0.25m2010NilIn addition, funding of some €14.2 million has also been provided to the Dublin Docklands Housing Trust for the acquisition of social housing units during the years 2008 and 2009, of which €1.7million was paid to the Revenue Commissioners by the Authority in respect of VAT on the sales price of the units.In terms of property or land exchanges completed by the Authority in the years 2007 to 2009, a total of €20.3 million was spent in acquiring three different sites / properties and €15 million expenditure was incurred by the Authority in the purchase of 62 affordable units.In relation to the information sought as to the source and amount of finance required to pay interest on the Becbay loan transaction, it should be borne in mind that, as a commercial State body, it is in the first instance the responsibility of the Authority to manage its financial affairs within its statutory parameters.  I understand that the Authority maintains regular contact with all of its lenders in respect of its ongoing commitments and is also engaging with the National Asset Management Agency regarding the repayment of its share of the loans to the Becbay joint venture.  The Authority paid interest charges totalling €9.2m in respect of the Becbay loans for the years 2007 and 2008, partly from its own funds and partly from its line of credit through National Irish Bank.  The Authority's annual interest charges of €4.4 million for 2009 and 2010 remain outstanding.

Part J (Heat Producing Appliances) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations addresses, among other things, safety concerns in relation to oil storage tanks.  Section 5 of the accompanying Technical Guidance Document J — Heat Producing Appliances outlines how the legal requirements in relation to oil storage tanks can be achieved in practice for buildings, including dwellings.  In general the intent of the legal requirements and the accompanying guidance is to provide protection against the risks of fire and leakage.It is intended that my Department will undertake a review of Part J of the Building Regulations in 2011.  The requirements and technical guidance in relation to oil storage tanks will be examined as part of this review.  Any proposed changes to the regulations will be preceded by a full public consultation and a Regulatory Impact Analysis.

As with any vehicle, the rate of taxation applicable for a vehicle owned by a charity varies depending on whether the vehicle is a goods vehicle or a passenger vehicle.For a vehicle to be taxed as a goods vehicle by any owner, it must be constructed or adapted as a goods vehicle and used solely in the course of trade or business.  The existing procedures applicable to any claim for the goods rate of motor tax apply equally to charities.The Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) (No. 2) Act 2008 provides for specific motor tax rates for vehicles constructed and adapted for the carriage of more than eight persons, owned by a youth or community organisation and used exclusively by the organisation solely for the purpose of conveying persons on journeys directly related to the activities of the organisation.  Outside these parameters, the rates of tax applicable to other private vehicles would also apply to those owned by a charity.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1909	The Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2010 includes provisions allowing all holders of valid firearm certificates issued for shotguns between 1 August 2009 and 31 July 2012 to be deemed to be the holders of a hunting licence under the Wildlife Acts for the purposes of hunting game bird and hare species.  This provision was introduced to address an issue which arose following the introduction of a new computerised firearm licensing system by An Garda Síochána.The Wildlife Acts require a hunter to have a licence to hunt certain birds (such as wildfowl) and hares. The Acts made provision that this would be obtained as an endorsement on the hunter's Firearm Certificate. Both the hunting licence and the Firearm Certificate were issued by An Garda Síochána in the form of a shotgun licence with the appropriate endorsement for hunting.New, computerised procedures introduced in 2009 for issuing 3-year Firearms Certificates omitted the facility for issuing the endorsement as a Wildlife Hunting licence.  I understand that by the time the oversight was identified, it was not practicable to recall the new Firearms Certificates issued or to change the licensing process that was in train.  Accordingly, provisions were included in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2010 to allow a hunter who is in possession of a new Firearms Certificate to shoot game birds and hare species during the Open Seasons.  These provisions will lapse on 31 July 2012, allowing the necessary changes to be made to the Garda computerised system in the intervening period.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  However, I have urged local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard.  My Department continues to keep matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.

This ambitious programme, consisting of 64 new projects, was identified following consideration of each proposal received, the relative priority afforded to the projects by the local authorities concerned and the competing demands across all local authorities.  At that time, the project in question, Gurranabraher House, was not considered suitable for inclusion.However, in June 2010, the Department received representations from Cork City Council to replace a project that would not now be proceeding under the 2010 programme with Gurranabraher House.  My Department has since indicated its support for this change in the 2010 programme and requested additional information to facilitate funding approval for the project.  This information has since been received and is being considered in the context of available funding and competing demands.

My Department wrote to South Dublin County Council on 17 September 2010 to notify the Council that the three year funding support for this project would, as per the original approval, cease at the end of 2010 and inviting the submission of final funding requests.  No response has been received as yet and the County Council has not otherwise indicated its intention to seek a continuation of the project.  The availability of funding for new projects, or the extension of existing projects, under the Fund in 2011 will be determined by the outcome of the current Estimates process.

One of the conditions of the Plan, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is in the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Innovation.In terms of comparison to other schemes of mortgage protection, it is important to note that it covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available.The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.

Generally speaking, the schemes are for the benefit of first time buyers, though, exceptionally, consideration may be given by local authorities in certain cases to those who have previously owned a home but now do not, due to divorce or similar circumstances.  Local authorities are required to draw up a scheme of allocation priorities based on broad criteria set out in legislation.  As the making and amendment of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority my Department has no role in the matter.

The decision as whether to take an estate is taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of a local authority.The 2010 Planning and Development (Amendment) Act replaced the reference to "owners or occupiers" with a reference solely to "owners", in response to a Law Reform Commission recommendation in relation to multi-unit developments, that only the owners of the property should have the say in relation to whether the development will be taken in charge.  This provision will be commenced shortly.

Specifically, the research shows that: three out of four Irish people believe that climate change is coming about as a result of human behaviour rather than as a natural process; there is 100% awareness of at least one initiative undertaken under the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012; the campaign has motivated 70% of Irish people to take steps to reduce their carbon number; and just three months after the campaign commenced, seven out of ten people in Ireland felt "it would be easy to take corrective action to reduce their carbon number".Given current economic circumstances, I decided in 2009 to conclude phase one of the campaign; the "Change" brand has been maintained by my Department and phase two of the campaign is being managed internally.  Among the measures involved are the development of a Greening Communities Network and the planned dissemination of a climate change educational resource across the primary school network.  The Change.ie website content has been integrated into the climate change content of the www.ENFO.ie site and will continue to be developed by An Chomhairle Leabharlanna, with the support of my Department, while the calculators continue to be maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency.Information in respect of the Power of One energy efficiency campaign is available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which manages that initiative.The costs of the change.ie campaign to date are:Change.ie2008€7.13m2009€2.64m2010€246,670 (to date)

Funding to local authorities for this purpose increased significantly between 2005 and 2010, rising from €1.5m to €5.6m, bringing total funding allocations since 2005 to almost €20m.The Local Government Efficiency Review Group's report and recommendations was published in July 2010 and does not include any recommendations with regard to the transfer of PRTB functions to the local authorities.I do not propose to transfer any of the PRTB's functions elsewhere. Instead, my focus is on optimising the efficiency with which the Board does its work and, to this end, in April 2009 my Department commenced a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates. The purpose of this review was to consider whether the Act best supported the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. I announced the preliminary outcomes of the review in November 2009; they include recommendations in a number of key areas, and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays. It is intended that these recommendations will be given effect, through amending legislation, as soon as possible.

Among the measures under consideration is the scope to develop specific enforcement standards or a statutorily-based code of practice for planning authorities with the aim of delivering more consistent enforcement approaches throughout the country and highlighting statutory requirements and standards to be complied with.  Consideration is also being given to enhancing the existing Planning Enforcement Extranet Site which enables planning authorities to share information on key planning enforcement issues and to develop best practice approaches to addressing problems in this area. The need for specialist training for planning enforcement staff to ensure that policy reforms are being implemented consistently and effectively, especially in the context of complex extractive industry enforcement cases, will also be explored.

If the project would not have required an EIA, then the planning authorities were advised to proceed to deal with the application in the normal course.  If the planning authority decided that an EIA would have been required, the Circular advised that the application be returned as invalid.The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 has amended the legislative provisions in relation to retention permission to provide that applications for retention may not be accepted in relation to applications which would have required EIA, or appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive, or would have required a determination as to whether EIA or appropriate assessment was required.  It is intended to commence this provision as soon as possible.  The implementation of the law in individual cases is a matter for the planning authority.  It would be a matter for the courts to decide if the law had been applied correctly in any case which came before them.

In that context, it is envisaged that new rent schemes should be in place in all housing authorities in early 2012.While it is not the intention to implement a national standardised differential rent scheme, regulations later this year will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including—the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for rent purposes;how dependents will be accounted for in calculating rent; andprocedures for rent reviews.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1943	The development and operation of a landfill is subject to the requirement to obtain a waste licence from the Environmental Protection Agency and planning permission from the local authority or An Bord Pleanála.  With regard to waste licensing, Annex I, Paragraph 1 of the EU Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC imposes "General Requirements for all classes of landfills", which include requirements relating to location, including a requirement that the location of a landfill must, inter alia, take into consideration the distances from the boundary of the site to residential and recreational areas. A landfill can only be authorised if the characteristics of the site with respect to the specified requirements, or the corrective measures to be taken, indicate that the facility would not pose a serious environmental risk.The EPA is required under national waste licensing legislation to attach to any licence which may be granted by it such conditions as the Agency considers necessary to ensure that there is full compliance with the Landfill Directive. With regard to planning legislation, applications for planning permission for all categories of development are considered by the relevant consenting authority taking account of, inter alia, the provisions of the development plan and other matters relating to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. There are therefore no specific provisions in planning legislation regarding the distance between waste management infrastructure and adjoining uses.

My Department is aware that the staff complement of the Agency was 15 in 2007 to 2009 and 13 in 2010.The core objective of the National Homelessness Strategy is to eliminate long term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by end 2010.  The homeless counts carried out in Dublin in 2008 and 2009 showed good progress in reducing rough sleeping and a further rough sleeper count is to take place in November 2010. Action to address homelessness is primarily a matter for the housing authorities and the HSE, which have statutory responsibility for providing accommodation and health care services, respectively, for homeless persons.  Responsibility for the allocation of tenancies rests with housing authorities.My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.A comprehensive range of measures has been put in place to underpin the role of housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards achieving the ambitious objectives of eliminating long term homelessness and ending the need to sleep rough. This includes an enhanced programme for procurement of accommodation, which was announced before Easter. Action to provide accommodation will be accompanied by the availability of supports, where necessary, to assist homeless people to progress to independent living in mainstream housing and maintain their tenancies on a long term basis. A public procurement process for the provision of a support service in Dublin has already been carried out and assessment of households in emergency or transitional homeless facilities for accommodation in mainstream housing is well advanced.  I recently announced the approval of €60 million for the purchase, by approved housing bodies, of houses and apartments which will provide some 431 units of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need, including persons exiting temporary homeless accommodation, older people and persons with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability.  Over 100 of these units will provide long-term accommodation for people who are moving out of temporary homeless accommodation.Delivery on these initiatives will be determined primarily by action on the part of housing authorities and approved housing bodies and the response of market interests, including property owners and financial institutions.  My Department is continuing to engage closely with the housing authorities to ensure that delivery of accommodation is maximised.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1947	The cross-Departmental/Agency Bioenergy Working Group is currently finalising a Bioenergy Road Map to 2020, which will underpin the contribution of bioenergy to Ireland's Renewable Energy target for 2020 and which will be submitted to me in the near future.  I announced earlier this year proposed REFIT tariffs for bioenergy produced from biomass, which will help foster the development of a sustainable biomass sector by driving demand for biomass.  The REFIT tariffs are subject to State Aid approval.The developing energy demand for biomass, underpinned by REFIT means that bioenergy waste, such as forestry thinnings, become valuable in its own right, and this can have effects on other business already operating in that sector.  My Department is committed to working closely with the stakeholders including Bord na Móna and Coillte to ensure against market distortion as a consequence of the REFIT tariffs.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1948	The Government recognises that the cost of energy in Ireland is a competitiveness issue facing the enterprise sector during this difficult period for the economy.  The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy.Ireland's recent higher energy costs, by comparison with EU average prices, were primarily due to significant dependence on volatile imported fossil fuels, particularly gas, as well as a requirement for very significant investment in energy infrastructure, following two decades of under-investment in the networks.  The under-investment in networks and power generation posed real risks to security of supply which had become a major concern for enterprise.  Recognising the concerns of indigenous business and the inward investment community, particularly in view of the difficult economic conditions, the Government has put in place a number of measures to mitigate the cost of energy for business.All electricity users benefitted in 2009 from rebates totalling €567m.  In July 2009 the Government agreed that these rebates would continue for large energy users at the same level until October 2010 and would then be phased out over the following two-year period.  The Carbon Revenue Levy commenced on July 1st 2010, after the passage of the Electricity Regulation (Carbon Revenue Levy) Act through the Oireachtas.  This Act levies electricity generators to capture a significant portion of the carbon windfall gains that they are currently receiving.  Receipts from the Carbon Revenue Levy will fund the large energy user rebate from Oct 1st 2010.  For small to medium business users, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) reduced regulated ESB prices twice in 2009, by an average of 10% from May 1st and a further 5.5% from October 1st 2009.Business customers can also avail of the competitive benefits of value and choice by shopping around for alternative suppliers.  Competition in the business electricity market has developed to such an extent that the CER has recently decided to end price regulation for ESB in this market segment, with effect from October 1st next.  As a result, ESB will be free to compete against the independent electricity suppliers for these customers.The CER is also close to completion of its 5-year review of electricity network expenditure.  This review proposes measures to ensure that ESB and EirGrid make greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure, thus minimising costs for consumers.  In line with Government policy, this review also includes some re-balancing of network tariffs in the interests of mitigating energy costs for business.Taken together, these measures, along with falling natural gas prices, have already had a significant impact on Ireland's international competitiveness over the last two years.  The latest comparative statistics available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) show that in general, Irish electricity prices in 2009 fell at a faster rate than in the rest of the EU, moving Ireland significantly closer to the EU average.  Prices for the majority of business consumption bands are within 6% of the EU average.  While EU comparison figures are not yet available for the first half of 2010, the SEAI data shows further significant reductions in Irish electricity prices in this period.  Prices for the large business categories have reduced on a cumulative basis by some 34% — 44% in the 18 months to June 2010.All customers will pay a higher Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy from October 1st 2010.  The PSO Levy is necessary to support the continued contribution of peat-generated electricity to security of supply and to deliver on the Government's 40% renewable electricity target, which also reflects Ireland's legally binding EU renewables obligations.  In the longer term, delivering on our renewables targets will reduce Ireland's exposure to high and volatile external fossil fuel prices. Even in the short term, PSO supported wind generation can help reduce wholesale electricity prices at times of high wind by displacing higher cost fossil fuel generators.The Government also remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices.  Significant progress has been made to date, most notably with the all-island Single Electricity Market now in its 3rd year of successful operation, the sale of ESB generation capacity, the entry of new players into both the generation and supply markets and new generation capacity coming on-stream in the Irish market.

My Department is currently finalising the State Aid application for submission to the Commission.Miscanthus remains a realistic option for consideration as an energy crop, together with other energy crops, for co-firing at the peat power plants as well as for renewable heat.  There are technical issues in relation to Miscanthus to be resolved, and there are likely to be limitations on the overall amount of miscanthus that can be used.  Although the volume already present in the market can be utilised fully.  The extent to which further expansion of Miscanthus production can be achieved remains under assessment.

As announced by the Minister for Finance in his statement of 14th October 2008, the Government has deferred decisions on the timing of the implementation of elements of the Decentralisation Programme, including that of my Department and agencies under its aegis, pending a review in 2011.The only estimate available for the total cost of the project would be in relation to the possible building works and that is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  My Department has not incurred any costs in 2010 associated with the decentralisation process.  The question of costs arising in the agencies is an operational matter for those agencies and as such is a matter in which I have no role.

The Government has no role in the corporate strategy of a private company and ComReg is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions.Government policy aims to facilitate effective competition in the electronic communications market.  The availability of appropriate wholesale products from eircom to alternative operators is crucial to facilitating such competition.  Various different forms of separation are possible to ensure the availability of wholesale products and ComReg is charged with ensuring such products are available.  Various recent developments, in terms of new products released by Eircom, as well as decisions made by ComReg, have resulted in increased competition in the market.  I am satisfied that the current policy environment and the regulatory regime, including appropriate access to the eircom network for alternative operators, are facilitating competition, reduced prices, greater choice and improved quality.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1960	One of the main aims of the Broadcasting Act 2009 was to provide opportunities for the development of a commercial digital terrestrial television (DTT) service in Ireland.  In this regard, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) was given the role of providing for commercial DTT service providers.  In particular, the legislation made provision for the BAI to enter into contracts with commercial multiplex service providers to establish, maintain and operate a multiplex within the coverage area specified in the contract and for the term of the contract.As the Deputy is aware, the competition initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) in 2008 failed to produce a national commercial DTT service provider and this failure has been largely attributed to the economic downturn and the consequential impact that this had on the business cases of the applicants.  The failure of the commercial DTT process was disappointing and it is now not expected that a commercial DTT operator will materialise until sometime after analogue switch off in 2012.  As a result, consideration of the potential in this regard and of the most appropriate mechanisms for delivering this will be undertaken closer to that time.In the meantime, the clear responsibility of my Department, in conjunction with the BAI, ComReg and other stakeholders, is to ensure the successful delivery of the ‘free-to-air' DTT service to the viewing public.  I have directed that this be done by the autumn of 2012 to facilitate switch-off of the analogue system and the consequential digital dividend that will arise.

I have subsequently announced the expansion of the scheme to cover electricity from offshore wind, wave and tidal energy, biomass CHP and Anaerobic Digestion. REFIT schemes are subject to State Aid clearance by the European Commission.  The costs of REFIT are covered through the Public Service Obligation Levy which applies to all electricity customers.The Geothermal Energy Development Bill currently being drafted by my Department will provide for the licensing of companies to explore for and develop deep geothermal energy resources.  The prospects for deep geothermal electricity in Ireland are being investigated by several companies.  The introduction of the overall licensing framework is designed to support the development of geothermal potential.In addition geothermal companies have signalled the need for a REFIT tariff for electricity from geothermal sources to underpin future project viability. In the context of finalising the overall framework for the development of geothermal energy, the REFIT tariff proposal will be examined by my Department.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1963	Public Service Obligations (or PSOs) are imposed to achieve national energy policy objectives which would not otherwise be delivered by competitive energy markets. In line with EU and national legislation, PSOs have been imposed to support power generation from peat as an indigenous fuel supply for security of supply purposes, to support renewable generation capacity to reduce emissions and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, and to support the development of additional generation capacity when it was needed in advance of the introduction of the Single Electricity Market.  In particular, two renewable electricity generation support mechanisms, REFIT and the Alternative Energy Requirement (AER), are included in the PSO.Electricity consumers pay for the additional cost of all these supports through the PSO levy.  Each year, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) calculates the estimated costs associated with implementing the various obligations and forecasts of electricity market revenues for the energy companies involved.  Where such electricity market revenues are not sufficient to cover the cost of implementing the obligations, additional supports in the form of "top-up" payments are necessary and are funded by electricity consumers through the PSO Levy.For the past few years, electricity market prices, and accordingly electricity market revenues, have been sufficiently high that additional "top-up" payments to support the obligations have not been required.  With recent electricity market prices significantly lower than in recent years, the CER has calculated that additional supports totalling some €156 million will be required to cover the full cost of implementing the obligations (including the REFIT Scheme) over the 12 month period commencing October 1st 2010.  This will mean a fixed annual charge of €32.76 for domestic customers from October 1st next.It is important to note that in some years the benefits accruing from the operation of certain renewable contracts under the AER mechanism, which actually paid money into the PSO Levy fund, were used to offset the additional payments required by other more expensive supports, for example for peat generation.  Accordingly in these years, the offsetting process resulted in all PSO costs being met in full without imposing a PSO Levy on electricity consumers.  The PSO Levy calculation process is set out in secondary legislation in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Order 2002 (S.I. No. 217 of 2002).  The CER adheres to this process in a transparent manner.As regards REFIT specifically, it has been payable to supply companies with REFIT contracts since the 2008/2009 PSO period. As outlined in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, REFIT is funded entirely from the PSO Levy and there is no intention to change this. Costs have been paid on an annual basis and have not been deferred.  Since REFIT PSO costs, in the same way as the peat PSO, are determined in advance for a year on the basis of an estimated market price, there is a later, or "ex post" correction two years later (known as ‘the R factor') to take account of actual market prices obtaining during the year.  Such a correction, relating to the 2008/2009 year is included in this year's PSO, in the normal way.The Government remains committed to ensuring that our renewables targets are delivered at as low a cost as possible while delivering on climate, competitiveness and energy security of supply objectives.

Section 14 of the 2002 Act provides that the CER may set the basis for charges for transporting gas through the transmission systems.Transmission charges are the CER approved costs that gas suppliers are required to pay the operator of the natural gas network (Gaslink on behalf of Bord Gáis Networks) for the transportation of gas through the system to the consumer and for the maintenance and development of the system itself.  Network charges are largely pass-through costs for suppliers.  These represent approximately 40% of the cost of gas to the Irish domestic consumer.The Irish gas network is relatively new infrastructure.  Ireland has seen significant investment in the network in the last number of years such as the Ireland-Scotland gas interconnectors and the gas pipeline to the west of Ireland.  These investments have contributed to overall network costs.  In addition, as Ireland has quite a fragmented population of a low density, more pipelines are needed to serve the customers.  On a per customer basis Ireland has considerably more gas pipelines than Great Britain, which equates to higher transmission charges per customer.In 2007 the CER carried out a comprehensive 5 year review of the price control regime for the transmission networks covering the period up to end September 2012.  The revenues that Bord Gáis Networks (BGN) are allowed to earn each year for operating, maintaining and upgrading the network were consulted upon and agreed in the 5 year Review.The Revenue Control Formula, which is set out in the CER decision, is used to calculate the maximum allowed revenues for BGN's transmission business for a given year of the control period.  These allowed revenues are set against a revised forecast of ‘peak day' and ‘throughput' gas demand values (for the same year) to produce the annual transmission capacity and commodity tariffs.  Capacity charges relate to booking space in the pipeline and commodity charges are levied per unit of gas delivered.Under the current regime 90% of allowed revenues for transmission are recovered through a capacity tariff with the remaining 10% recovered through a commodity tariff.  Different ratios of capacity and commodity could be chosen, but the allowed revenues for the year would stay the same and on average the costs to customers would stay the same.  For example, if the capacity element was reduced this would, on average, lead to lower summer bills (when consumption is low) but winter bills would be higher.In July of this year, as part of the price control BGN made their annual submission to the CER.  Following the completion of a consultation process the CER directed that revised transmission tariffs be applied from 1 October 2010 to end September 2011.  Compared with last year's tariff, the 2010/11 transmission tariffs represent an increase of 1.9% for some categories of shippers and an increase of 6.9% in nominal terms for other shippers in nominal terms.  The 2010/2011 distribution tariffs result in a decrease of 3.4% in nominal terms.  Overall, this leaves network charges for the average domestic customer at broadly the same level as last year.In relation to BG Energy gas supply tariffs, the CER has recently decided, following its annual review, that there should be no change in the BG Energy domestic gas tariff from 1 October 2010.  It should also be noted that the CER has instituted a number of decreases in the regulated BG Energy gas supply tariffs since January 2009 resulting in a cumulative decrease of 27% over the period in the BGE tariff for residential and small and medium businesses.In relation to larger gas users, analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, based on Eurostat data for the second half of 2009, shows that Irish industrial gas prices, when compared to the Euro area average, were below the Euro average in all industrial gas user categories.  The Irish gas market has been fully opened up to competition since July 2007.  There is now strong competition in the industrial and business segments of the market and increasing competition in the residential segment.  Customers who switch to alternative unregulated suppliers can avail of significant reductions.The CER will commence its review of network charges next year for the 5 year period commencing October 2012.  In reaching its decision the CER will take due account of all perspectives including the views of all suppliers and of business customers themselves.

On Wednesday 23rd June, it was drawn to EirGrid's and the inspector's attention that there was an error in the newspaper public notice and site notice relating to pylon height ranges for a section of the project.  It is the case that full details of the correct heights of the towers concerned were fully described in the Environmental Impact Statement and in the accompanying planning drawings, which were submitted to An Bord Pleanála.Following consultation with its legal advisers EirGrid was advised that under the applicable legislation there is no mechanism to correct the error within the context of the application.  EirGrid therefore notified An Bord Pleanála on Tuesday 29th June, of the withdrawal of its application for the Meath-Tyrone 400 kV Interconnection Development Project.EirGrid has undertaken a review of the circumstances which led to the error in the public notice and I have been furnished with a copy of this review.  I have already made clear my strong disappointment that EirGrid had to withdraw its planning consent application for this important development.  Following the completion of the review, I have asked EirGrid to ensure that all appropriate control procedures are reviewed and enhanced to safeguard against errors in any part of the planning consent application, both for this project and any future development projects.The Meath-Tyrone 400 kV interconnection project is of significant strategic importance from an all-island electricity market perspective, and from the perspectives, both North and South, of security of supply, competitiveness, economic growth and renewable electricity integration.  I have therefore also stressed to EirGrid the importance of submitting a new planning application for this key piece of infrastructure as soon as possible, bearing in mind the complexity of the application work.  EirGrid advises that most of the work from the original planning consent application remains valid and applicable to the new planning consent application, which should assist in expediting the process.

Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.That mapping exercise found that a number of existing broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme in accordance with EU State Aid and competition rules.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.

In a common law context, the obligation on the postal service provider to deliver all letters to the addressees (and only to return to the sender in very limited and defined circumstances) is an essential feature of the judicial system and contract law.  This position is reflected in Section 84 of the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act which prohibits the opening, delaying, detention or the prevention of delivery of postal packets except in circumstances where the addressee agrees to such an action and in other limited circumstances.  Whilst the Postal Services Bill will modernise Section 84, I do not propose to change the legal principles set out in that section.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1976	The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers.  These services are provided over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  Such intervention is governed by very strict EU rules, one of which is that we must be technology neutral when seeking to procure solutions to service gaps.  It is therefore solely a matter for service providers, even when acting on behalf of the State, to decide on what is the most appropriate technology platform to deploy.In rolling out the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) service, 3 is using a mix of technologies to reach those seeking a service (wireless, repeater/external antenna and satellite).  Prior to the commencement of the NBS a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ieIt continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1977	The changes in the regulated electricity prices for domestic consumers from this October are attributable to the re-introduction of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy due to the decline in gas prices.  The key elements of this levy, which supports renewable and indigenous peat generation, were first put in place in 2001.  The Levy was set at zero for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 as a result of high gas prices.  The PSO Levy in 2010/11 will mean a fixed annual charge of €32.76 per domestic consumer, equating to an additional €2.73 per month.The methodologies for calculating costs and the timing of decisions are underpinned in secondary legislation in the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  I have no discretion in this regard.  The PSO levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated from indigenous (i.e. peat), sustainable and renewable sources.  In short, it is the method through which security of energy supplies and the development of renewable electricity in Ireland is supported, in line with the Government's energy policy objectives and Ireland's binding EU renewables energy target for 2020.Any price increase, however unavoidable, adds to the difficulties of many consumers in the current environment.  However, significant savings are available to domestic consumers who simply switch their electricity supplier.  Although approximately 600,000 customers have switched to date, up to 70% of customers have yet to avail of discounts of between 10-14%, which would more than outweigh any new PSO Levy costs.Customers can also help mitigate energy costs by taking advantage of a wide range of Government supported energy efficiency programmes.  Funding in 2010 of €90m has been allocated to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for the continued expansion of its domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency schemes.The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), which is targeted at low income households, has assisted 39,831 homes, with spending of €37.1m from 2006 to date.  The Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES) provides grants towards the cost of energy efficiency investments (such as insulation) in homes.  It has assisted a further 51,605 homes, with a total budget €45.3mil from 2008 to date.  These programmes are in addition to the Greener Homes Scheme, which has provided €70.4m in grants towards 27,516 residential renewable energy installations from 2006 onwards.In tandem with the increased level of activity in existing programmes this year, the Department and SEAI are also designing a new retrofit programme, which will be launched shortly.  This programme is currently the subject of a public consultation but in broad terms it will bring together the existing HES and WHS, as well as support programmes for businesses and the public sector.The retrofit programme will make discounts on retrofit work available up front rather than having to wait for retrospective grant payments, and will make energy efficiency measures more accessible to both homes and businesses.  The programme will significantly contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets, including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal.  Pending the finalisation and introduction of the retrofit programme, the HES and WHS will continue in their current form in 2010.

In accordance with section 125 of the Act, the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas may establish a public service channel to be made available throughout the island of Ireland providing coverage of:proceedings of both Houses of the Oireachtas;proceedings of a local authority;institutions under the British-Irish Agreement;other legislatures; andUN, EU and Council of Europe institutions.The 2009 Act provides that the cost of such a channel would be met from the budget of the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas and that no advertising is permitted on the channel.  In relation to the Film Channel, section 127 of the Act provides that the Irish Film Board may establish a public service channel to be made available throughout the island of Ireland providing coverage of Irish, European and World films including those in the Irish language.  The Act provides that the cost of such a channel would be met from the budget of the Irish Film Board.  The Act also provides that the Irish Film Channel can broadcast advertisements.My Department will continue working with the Irish Film Board, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and with the Houses of the Oireachtas to see how the film and Oireachtas channels can be delivered.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1979	The National Oil Reserves Agency Limited (NORA) is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its EU and International Energy Agency (IEA) obligations to maintain 90 days' oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and by entering into agreements with third parties in Ireland and other EU Member States.NORA currently holds approximately 80 days of Ireland's 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.  Of the stocks held by NORA, approximately 49% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 44% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 7% are held as stock "tickets" (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of a crisis).NORA's storage capacity in Ireland at present is 711,997 tonnes and holds stocks of Gasoline, Kerosene, Jet Kerosene, Gas Oil and Diesel.  At present the majority of NORA’s stocks in Ireland are held at Whiddy Island, Bantry.  Government policy is to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  NORA is delivering on this objective through the refurbishment of three new locations on the island of Ireland (Ringsend, Tarbert & Kilroot), with facilities for 320,000 tonnes of storage.  NORA is also considering further storage opportunities, with a view to further increasing the level of stocks held on the island.The existing commercial gas storage facility at Kinsale has the capacity to hold 198 million cubic metres of natural gas. Licensed for use by Bord Gáis Éireann, the facility could potentially supply around 50% of residential and SME gas needs for up to 50 days in the event of a gas disruption.Given the continued importance of gas for power generation, and our high level of import dependence, security of gas supply remains a fundamental priority for this country.  It is clear that gas storage has an important role to play in contributing to enhanced gas security for the island of Ireland.  Therefore, I welcome the current market interest in developing further commercial gas storage, both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland.

The MANs Programme, which commenced in 2002, has so far delivered eighty-six optical fibre based networks to ninety-two towns and cities throughout the country.Phase I of the MANs programme delivered optical fibre based networks to twenty-seven towns and cities around the country.  The total capital cost of Phase I of the programme was €85 million (€76m approximately met by my Department and €9m approximately, met by the local authorities).Phase II of the MANs programme delivered a further fifty-nine optical fibre based networks serving sixty-five towns and cities.  The total capital cost of Phase II of the programme was €89.5 million (€80.3m approximately met by my Department and €9.2m approximately met by the local authorities).The details of the capital cost met by my Department for each MANs project are set out in the following tables.  The figures represent 90% of the cost of the MANs.  A further 10% was funded by the Local Authority in whose area each MAN was built.  Both phases were subject to European Regional Development Funding of either 40% or 50% depending on the region in which they were built.There are twenty-four active Phase I MANs, with a total of nine hundred and ninety-two wholesale connections.  Currently, there are thirteen active Phase II MANs with thirty-six wholesale connections.  Discussions regarding wholesale connections to a further five MANs are ongoing and likely to lead to them being activated in the coming months.  It should be noted that all connections to the MANs are wholesale connections, which may be used by the relevant service provider to provide services to multiple end users.All Phase I and Phase II MANs are operated and managed by e|net who were appointed following a procurement process and who make the networks available to the telecommunications sector.  e|net is a commercial organisation and information on revenue generated by the MANs is commercially sensitive.  A survey conducted by e|net found that approximately 600,000 end users are served by service providers using the Phase I MANs.ProjectMans IncludedCost€CorkCork12,300,719GalwayGalway9,944,250GweedoreGweedore533,014LeitrimCarrick-on-Shannon2,941,956ManorhamiltonLetterkennyLetterkenny3,441,713LimerickLimerick6,860,077MayoBallina Kiltimagh4,553,773MidlandsAthlone12,034,840MullingarPortlaoiseRoscommonTullamoreNorth EastCarrickmacross12,133,038CavanDroghedaDroghedaDundalkKingscourtMonaghanSligoSligo3,718,106South EastCarlow16,632,111ClonmelDungarvanKilkennyWaterfordWexfordTotal85,093,597ProjectMans IncludedCost€Cork CountyBantry17,666,534BlarneyCarrigalineCharlevilleDunmanwayFermoyFermoyKanturkMidletonMitchelstownPassage WestRingaskiddySkibbereenYoughalDonegalBallybofey10,062,944BallyshannonBuncranaBundoranCardonaghDonegal TownStranorlarFingalDonabate3,714,942LuskPortraneSkerriesGalwayAthenry8,245,417BallinasloeClifdenGortLoughreaKerryCastleisland6,187,241KillarneyListowelTraleeLongfordLongford Town2,384,574MayoBallinrobe3,303,925ClaremorrisKnockMeathClonee8,959,252DunboyneDunshaughlinKellsNavanTrimMidlandsEdenderry1,788,121North EastArdee6,523,688BailieboroughCastleblaneyClonesCootehillSERACahir7,411,544Carrick-on-SuirCashelThomastownTipperaryShannon BroadbandAbbeyfeale10,776,090BanagherBirrKilrushNenaghNewcastlewestRoscreaTemplemoreWicklowBlessington2,566,554KilcooleNewtownmountkennedyTotal89,590,827
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1981	The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets of 20% across the economy and 33% in the public sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  There is a requirement in the Energy Services Directive that all Member States must submit their second NEEAP's in 2011 and progress on all savings made will be reported in that context.In the public sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance of new buildings and facilities, improvement of existing buildings and facilities, encouraging more public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) Public Sector Programme is the main delivery mechanism for energy efficiency actions by public sector bodies.In 2009, the SEAI delivered a €5 million programme that provided grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme supported energy efficiency measures for businesses and institutions across the country.  Over 74 projects were funded under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual energy savings worth €2.6 million and 12kt CO2 were achieved. The public sector accounted for 50 of these projects and the majority of the savings, with €2.2m and 9.8kt CO2 saved.Building on this success, in June 2010 the SEAI launched the €9 million Energy Efficiency Fund.  The scheme was quickly oversubscribed and to date over43projects have been approved.  The fund supports exemplar projects which achieve significant and verifiable energy savings and provide key learnings for other businesses and public sector bodies.  The projects, 20 of which are public sector, and 23 private and voluntary sectors, will be completed by the end of 2010, and the energy efficiency actions taken will create lifetime savings of over €70 million.  Some 50,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions will also be avoided each year as a result. The SEAI also run a Public Sector support programme providing energy assessments and training to all public sector bodies, and tailored services to larger public sector bodies through its Partnership Scheme.  In 2009 and 2010 the assessment and training supports are estimated to result in savings of up to €3.3 million. A range of best practice guides were also developed especially in the transport and lighting sectors.Through the SEAI's Public Sector Partnership scheme, the Authority is assisting public sector bodies in the development of 2020 energy efficiency strategies, in best practice working groups and advanced assessments and training.  To date, three working groups have been formed in water services, public lighting and Information and Communications Technology (ICT).  Members of the working groups have made savings in 2010 of up to 20% in participating facilities and identified further savings in some cases as high as 40-50%.  An energy efficiency design process initiated to incorporate energy efficiency principles into the design of new or retrofitted public sector facilities was also developed. The Energy Efficiency Design process has been employed in over eight major capital projects, including local authority facilities, schools, Metro North and the new National Paediatric Hospital, highlighting 5 — 30% possible savings in life cycle costs.Regulations introduced in December 2009 require all public bodies to include, in their annual reports published after January 1st 2011, a statement describing the actions they are taking to improve energy efficiency in their respective organisation, together with an assessment of the energy savings arising from those actions.  The SEAI and my Department are working together on the methodologies for reporting annual energy consumption and savings.  This reporting system will form the basis for monitoring the Public Sector's progress towards the 33% target.Current regulations give effect to the EU Energy Efficiency Directive which includes new energy efficient public procurement rules.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on the SEAI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database has already been developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.The SEAI is also required, under the regulations, to produce general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and this is being progressed in conjunction with the National Procurement Service and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG). The SEAI is liaising with the DEHLG on the national Green Procurement Plan.In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Building Regulations, it is the policy of the Office of Public Works (OPW) to conduct feasibility studies on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings of over 1,000m2 as part of the design process.  The OPW has already installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  The OPW's Optimising Power at Work programme has seen savings of between 10-15% on average in participating buildings. In one instance, one particular building has recorded savings of 43%.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish achievable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO2 emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy including public sector buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in the coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.The National Retrofit Programme will build on the success of existing domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency programmes.  The new programme aims to deliver energy efficiency upgrades to one million residential, public and commercial buildings in Ireland, and will involve energy supply companies, energy services providers, construction workers, energy auditors and policymakers, working together to deliver energy savings, cost reductions and ultimately smaller carbon footprints for energy customers throughout the country.  It will create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal and will also significantly contribute to our goal of meeting national efficiency targets.

Network operators cannot be statutorily required to open their infrastructure for use by other service providers unless they are found by ComReg to hold significant market power (SMP).  No mobile phone operators have been found to hold SMP in Ireland. However, the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Access) Regulations 2003, provide operators with a right to negotiate interconnection with another operator for the purpose of providing publicly available electronic communications services and also obliges requested operators to negotiate interconnection requests.These regulations also make it a function of ComReg to encourage and where appropriate, ensure, adequate access, interconnection and interoperability of services in accordance with the regulations in the interest of efficiency, competition and benefits to end-users.

This is underpinned by a programme goal "to enhance the competitiveness of energy markets".  Implicit in the pursuit of this goal is the objective of reducing or maintaining competitive energy prices whilst also needing to ensure sustainability and security of supply.  One of the eleven key strategies to which the Deputy refers, picks up, inter alia, on this in seeking to promote competition.

The data contained in this report covers the last six months of 2009.Table 9 on page 19 of that report shows the average electricity price paid by all categories of business in Ireland per unit of electricity consumed and compares those figures with the Eurozone average.  This table is reproduced below:Category of Electricity ConsumptionCost — € per KwhRelative to Euro Area AverageBand IA (Consumption < 20Mwh)0.16997%Band IB (20Mwh < Consumption < 500Mwh)0.141112%Band IC (500Mwh < Consumption < 2,000Mwh)0.118111%Band ID (2,000Mwh < Consumption < 20,000Mwh)0.097102%Band IE (20,000Mwh < Consumption < 70,000Mwh)0.089104%Band IF (70,000Mwh < Consumption < 150,000Mwh)0.079103%Electricity prices for small businesses are 3% below the Eurozone average.  Electricity prices rise above the Eurozone average for other categories of business, but these figures still represent a significant improvement in Ireland's electricity price competitiveness compared to 2008.SEAI has collected and submitted to Eurostat the electricity cost figures for the first six months of 2010 and these show that Irish electricity costs have continued to fall for all categories of business. In fact, the figures show that electricity prices for business have fallen by up to 45% in the past eighteen months.  These will be published by SEAI as soon as the relevant comparative data from Eurostat becomes available and are also provided below: Business Electricity prices as at 30/06/2010Category of Electricity ConsumptionCost — € per KwhChange in 18 months to Jun 2010Band IA0.157-10%Band IB0.137-12%Band IC0.112-21%Band ID0.084-34%Band IE0.076-34%Band IF0.056-44%Table 16 on page 28 of the SEAI report shows that Band DD represents 53% of the domestic electricity market.  For the average Irish domestic electricity consumer Irish prices are below the Eurozone average by 2%.  The figures do not include purchasing power parities. If these are included the average Irish domestic electricity consumer is paying 12% less than the Eurozone average, as illustrated by table 19 on page 30 of the SEAI report.Almost 70% of domestic consumers may still avail of significant discounts simply by switching their electricity supplier.  This is also true for over 50% of small to medium enterprises. It is important that all customers who are concerned about energy costs should shop around and take advantage of the value and choice available in the competitive electricity market.  Customers can also help mitigate energy costs by taking advantage of a wide range of Government-supported energy efficiency programmes.Given Ireland's dependence upon imported fossil fuels, the urgent need to fund much needed network investment, the size of our market and low population density it is a significant achievement that our electricity prices for domestic consumers are below the Eurozone average, while those for business are close to the average and below many of our neighbours and competitors.

It is my intention that RTÉ services will be available on a ‘free-to-air' basis throughout the island of Ireland.  The manner in which any BBC services would be provided is primarily a matter for the BBC.My Department continues to engage with ComReg, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs, RTÉ and the Authorities in the UK to provide for the availability of RTÉ and TG4 throughout Northern Ireland.A copy of the Memorandum of Understanding is available on www.dcenr.ie.

Electricity generated at the 3 Peat fired power stations is covered under the Public Service Obligation which was introduced in 2001.  This allows the companies involved, Bord na Móna and ESB, to claim back certain costs from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) fund.  Because biomass displace peat, and the carbon costs associated with peat, the calculation of any potential costs associated with co-firing has to include any additional costs imposed by REFIT, less the savings related to reduced amounts of peat being used.The cost effects of REFIT for co-firing is dependent on the average price of electricity in any given year, the amount of biomass that is actually consumed, the cost of purchasing carbon credits, and the breakdown of that feedstock between ordinary biomass and energy crops.  However, were the reference price for electricity to be €80 MW/h in 2015, and all three peat stations to co-fire to 30% with a mix of 60:40 biomass to energy crops, the gross rate would be approximately €21m, per annum, against which would have to be set the reduced cost of consuming peat, particularly important given the associated carbon emissions (presumed to be €39/t as per the Department of Finance Guidelines).  Even leaving aside the savings associated with the reduced cost of producing the peat, the carbon savings alone of 927,000 tonnes would result in a saving of €36.2m euro, giving a net benefit of over €15m to the PSO from co-firing.At €100 MW/h, that gross effect would be an increase of €2.2m per annum, and the net price would involve a reduction in the PSO of €34m, largely due to the savings in Carbon emissions, which would remain the same as in the above example.

There is now very significant global investment under way in research and development in the electrification of transport.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment of electric vehicles appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland's decision to be an early mover in this field.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed particularly in relation to network infrastructure development.The ESB will roll out 1,500 charge points on a nationwide basis by December 2011.  The rollout has already begun with 12 on street charge points installed as follows:LocationDate EnergisedFitzwilliam Street ×  2, Adelaide Road and Wilton Place (Dublin)1st April 2010Nissan, Parkwest (Dublin)30th July 2010Cavan Courthouse (Cavan)6th August 2010Wood Quay (Galway)9th August 2010South Mall, Woburn Court and CIT (Cork)6th September 2010Sandyford Business Centre ×  2 (Dublin)1st October 2010 (due date)Intel (Kildare)7th October 2010 (due date)Parnell Square, Arundel Square (Waterford)11th October 2010 (due date)Also, 15 domestic charge points and 13 industrial chargers have also been installed, as part of the eCar trial being undertaken by ESB.  There is no data currently available on the level of usage of the charge points.  The roll out of these charge points will accelerate towards year end, in anticipation of the first production EVs from major manufacturers coming to market in early 2011.  It is anticipated that approximately 200 public charge points will be in place by year end.  ESB also plans to install up to 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2001	The REFIT scheme, which guarantees a minimum price for certain classes of renewable electricity generation, is designed to underpin the business case for investors in the renewable generation sector. A key component of the scheme is the requirement for Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) between renewable energy generators and suppliers.  The PPAs create certainty for generators and incentivise suppliers to purchase renewable electricity.Payments, including the 15% balancing payment, are made to the suppliers who enter commercially negotiated Power Purchase Agreements with generators of renewable electricity.  Under a PPA, the supplier undertakes to purchase all the output from a renewable energy generator at contract prices which are fixed between the generator and the supplier at the commencement of each individual contract for 15 years, irrespective of the open market pool price.The supplier also assumes the market interaction role between the individual generator and the pool market and incurs additional costs in respect of this which are also reflected in the balancing payment.In designing the REFIT scheme, my Department concluded that in order to ensure suppliers' critical participation in developing renewable generation capacity in the liberalised electricity market, a proportionate balancing payment mechanism was necessary.  There has been a steady increase in total capacity of renewable projects on the system since the introduction of the REFIT scheme.The CER decision paper for the 2010/2011 PSO decision shows that  for the PSO periods of 1st January 2007 to 30th December 2007 and 1st January 2008 to 30th September 2008,, the PSO levy was set to zero to be recovered in subsequent years because the amount to be collected each year was relatively small. It was considered that the administrative burden of collecting these levies would have been excessive. For the 1st October 2008 to 30th September 2009 PSO levy period, a negative PSO levy of €13.9m was determined based on a high forecasted benchmark price of €112.25/MWh. The PSO levy was set to zero because PSO legislation does not provide for a negative PSO levy amount. For the 1st October 2009 to 30th September 2010 PSO levy period, a small positive PSO levy was determined, which facilitated the PSO levy being set to zero.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2002	Article 35 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union forbids any quantitative restrictions on exports and all measures having equivalent effect.  This Article would prevent Ireland or any Member State from placing any restrictions on the export of electricity whether the power benefits from a feed in tariff or otherwise.Under the terms of the Renewable Energy directive, the renewable value of generation stays in the country of generation except in the case of formal written agreement between any Member States to allow transfer of the statistical value of that generation between them. That formal agreement has to be notified to the Commission by both Member States for any such transfer to be accepted by the Commission.There is currently no such agreement in place between Ireland and any other Member State.Cross-border transactions within the electricity sector are regulated by EC Regulation 1228/2003.  Under this regulation users (ie generators) of an interconnector can only be charged for utilising interconnector capacity when demand is greater than availability.  At other times, EirGrid as the interconnector owner and operator will recover the cost of the interconnector through transmission charges.It is also the case that it is impossible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2003	A range of international, EU and national analysis underpins the case for support schemes, such as REFIT, for renewable electricity technologies to provide greater certainty for investors thus facilitating the financing of the investments.  As set out in Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), it has been estimated by the Commission for Energy Regulation and EirGrid that between 4630MW and 5800MW of renewable generation is required, depending on economic growth assumptions and electricity demand projections, to ensure 40% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.Together with the 10% renewables target for the transport sector and the 12% renewables target for the heat sector, meeting the 40% electricity target will ensure the achievement of Ireland's legally binding EU target of 16% of all energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.Together with existing operational renewable electricity capacity of 1,750MW and capacity which has already signed connection offers of around 1,200 MW, there are 4,000 MW of applications under the Gate 3 scheme which are currently being processed.  This indicates that the 40% target will be achieved and that the REFIT scheme is operating effectively to assist this objective.  In addition to the REFIT scheme, undertaking the requisite investment in the transmission and distribution networks and timely planning and connection processes are critical to ensuring that the necessary level of renewable capacity under GATE 3 is delivered to meet the target.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2004	Liberalisation of the postal services market is required under the third Postal Services Directive by the 31st of December, 2010.The Directive is based on an EU Commission study on the impact on the universal postal service of the full accomplishment of a liberalised postal services market.  This study concluded that full market opening is achievable in all Member States.The postal market is already partially opened.  Parcel post is fully competitive, and all mail in excess of 50 grams is currently open to all competitors.  Legislation to transpose the Directive, and give effect to this final step in the gradual and controlled opening of this market to competition, is currently being drafted in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I hope to publish this legislation shortly with a view to having it enacted before the end of the year.The issues for Ireland arising from the Directive have been widely and comprehensively consulted upon, and as with all legislative proposals, a regulatory impact analysis is conducted.  The Department held an open and comprehensive public consultation in 2008, and an Options Paper examining the options and making recommendations was published in 2009.  I hosted a forum in November 2009, which was attended by postal service providers, the wider business community, the postal regulator, staff representation groups, and users' interests groups, and in the main, there was broad support for the recommendations outlined in the Options Paper.Liberalisation will bring many new opportunities.  However, with or without liberalisation, there are many challenges facing An Post and the Irish postal sector generally.  Globally the postal sector is facing challenges from electronic substitution, declining postal volumes generally, and the impact of the recent general economic downturn.The Government's core policy goal for the postal sector is to ensure that Irish customers, both business and residential, enjoy competitively priced, high quality postal services.  The economy and society at large need a strong and vibrant postal service.

As the Deputy is aware the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes outlined a wide range of proposals across all Departments, a number of which, if agreed to proceed, can only be achieved through restructuring over a number of years.  The consideration of the proposals for my Department and the Agencies under its aegis is ongoing and as the table shows, progress has been made in relation to certain proposals.  In addition, my Department has committed to current expenditure savings amounting to €13 million over the 2009 Estimate in 2010.

Furthermore, following recent queries raised by my Department with the Authority, it has been clarified to me that the 3-year estimates will now not be available until the end of October.This delay results from a decision of the Authority that the Budget for the period 2011-2013, which will be the BAI's first three-year budget, needs to be framed in the context of the Statement of Strategy for the same period on the basis that the content of the Statement of Strategy provides the framework for the objectives and work-plan of the organisation and the budget supports the activities to be undertaken to achieve these objectives.As the Deputy may be aware, the Authority is currently engaged in a comprehensive process in regard to the development of its Statement of Strategy and this has involved wide-scale consultation with industry and other key players.  I am informed by the Authority that, on the basis that a draft Strategy is finalised over the coming weeks, it expects that the 3-year Budget will be agreed and submitted to me before the end of October.While this goes beyond the timeline provided for in the legislation, I have been assured by the Authority of its continued commitment to comply with the will of the Oireachtas as expressed in the legislation.  In this instance, while the Authority regrets the likely delay, its view is that the approach being taken is the most appropriate to best serve the needs of the broadcasting industry in that it will provide greatest certainty regarding the Authority's future work and expenditure plans and, through this, the clarity needed by industry on the level of levy that it will be required to pay over the coming 3-year period.In relation to publication, the legislation requires that, subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, the Authority shall publish its 3-year estimates or a summary of them on a website maintained by the Authority.   I am very much aware that both public and commercial broadcasters will be keen to view the Authority's expenditure proposals as early as possible and it is my intention to facilitate this as much as practicable in the circumstances.

These projects make a positive contribution in many ways as has been borne out in reports on the outcomes of the schemes.I am aware too that other initiatives such as "Log-on Learn" — involving transition year students, An Post and the corporate sector — are also making a positive contribution in helping older people to acquire digital skills.Digital engagement is, I believe, an area which merits continued support subject to availability of resources.  Since resources are scarce we need to find ways to be even more effective with fewer resources.I also wish to explore ways we could involve more of the stakeholders (including the corporate sector who are also significant beneficiaries of increased digital engagement) and others working in relevant areas to see how we might best work together in a more coordinated way to achieve more digital engagement from which all will benefit.  Future investment in this area will be considered in the above context.

The Council have indicated that they, in consultation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), are progressing detailed design of the repair works to the fish pass.  They have advised me that these works will be undertaken in conjunction with the OPW's Flood Relief Works at Fermoy, which are scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2014	My Department in conjunction with the Marine Institute has been implementing a new strategy in the treatment of sea lice for the last three years which is having a beneficial effect.  There has been a steady incremental decrease in sea lice infestation levels in Connemara over this period. The site in question is now being managed as part of a suite of sites to ensure separation of generations and fallowing between stocking with new fish.Over the period from the stocking of the site in late 2009 until it was fallowed in August 2010 following the final harvest of fish, notices to treat were issued by the Marine Institute when either ovigerous or mobile sea lice levels warranted this. On each occasion the farm responded by arranging and carrying out a treatment as advised. A total of five treatments have been documented and it is clear that the farm did indeed carry out these treatments as the resultant reductions in sea lice infestation levels were recorded in subsequent inspections by the Marine Institute.The full implementation of best practice in regard to sea lice management in Connemara will result in further improvements in sea lice control in the coming growing cycle.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2020	In relation to the 2010 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, I have exercised the option of making an advance payment of 75 per cent of DAS beginning on 22 September, with the balancing 25 per cent payment commencing 20 October.  I have taken this option because of the EU requirement to entirely process applications before payment can be made in full.  However, this approach will ensure the maximum number of farmers will get an advance payment, whereas a far fewer number of farmers could be paid in full if an alternative option were taken.  The rate of payment under DAS is unchanged from last year and I am confident that all applicants will receive their full entitlement when their maps and applications are fully processed.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2032	The person named applied for 29 animals under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme.  Under the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, one of the primary requirements for applicants with herds of more than 10 cows, the animals must be weaned in at least two separate groups with at least five days between the weaning of each group. The person named declared that he had weaned all of the animals on 15 October 2009 and, therefore, was ineligible for payment. The applicant subsequently submitted additional information. My Department sought further clarification but the applicant has not responded to date. The application will be processed to finality on receipt of the applicant's response.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2036	On 23 April 2010 the Food Safety Authority of Ireland advised that it was investigating an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium DT8 in humans that was linked to the consumption of duck eggs.  Subsequent investigations revealed that nine individual flocks were infected.Duck eggs are not covered under EU legislation on marketing standards or zoonosis and there is no scheme of compensation for producers whose duck egg flocks are Salmonella positive.  Nevertheless, my Department met with representatives of the sector and, having regard to the difficulties being experienced as a result of this outbreak, agreed to a once-off ex-gratia contribution of €16 per duck for flockowners who voluntarily depopulated, subject to their agreeing to a new Code of Practice governing the industry and registering with the Department.In addition, affected flock owners were required to ensure that replacement stock was sourced from salmonella-free flocks and that certain biosecurity and hygiene measures were put in place. Under EU Food Hygiene Regulations, responsibility for ensuring the safety of food being placed on the market rests with the producer.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2037	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1631, 1635 and 1661 together.The person named applied for 64 animals under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme and payment has issues in respect of 58 animals.  Payment cannot be made for the remaining animals until the outstanding queries are satisfactorily dealt with, and my Department is awaiting a response from the applicant in relation to these queries.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2038	The person named applied for 23 animals under the Suckler Welfare Scheme for 2009.Payment was made in March 2010 in respect of 8 of these animals. A number of queries arose on the remaining 15 animals during the validation process undertaken by my Department.  A letter has issued to the applicant requesting clarification and a reply is awaited.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2039	The person named applied for 24 animals under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme.  Payments have already been issued to the applicant in respect of 23 animals. Payment for the remaining animal was recently approved by my Department and it will issue shortly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2040	The person named registered 19 beef breed calves in 2009.  A number of queries regarding the animals were identified and correspondence issued to the person named.  A response has been received recently and is currently being examined.  Payment will issue shortly if all of the queries are resolved in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2041	As part of this Department's review of areas declared by applicants under the Single Payment Scheme, two ineligible areas (dwelling house and roadway) were identified and removed from the applications of the person named.  This resulted in the eligible area of the parcel in question being reduced and over-payments posted for each of the application years concerned (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009).  While the person named was advised, in writing, of the finding and the monetary implications, to date, no appeal has been received in relation to this case.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2042	There are 1820 less than 12 metre vessels currently entered on the Fishing Boat Register.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2043	Funding was provided under the 2009 Fishery Harbour & Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme for the completion of a feasibility study on the dredging of the harbour.  This study was undertaken by Engineering Consultants RPS on the proposed methods and related dredging costs for Dunmore East harbour.  The final report was issued in November 2009. The main findings were that 80% of the harbour sediment contains Tributyltin (TBT).  The cost associated with the disposal of dredge spoil containing TBT is significantly higher than for uncontaminated material.  Various options for dredging the harbour were examined and in general the costs were in the order of €6 million.My Department's Engineering division undertook a more detailed Hydrographic Study in the harbour recently and this is currently being examined by our Engineers, however this will not in any way alter the overall cost to any significant degree.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2044	I understand that the application in question has been referred to South Tipperary County Council for observations and my Department has not, as yet, received a reply.  On receipt of a report from South Tipperary County Council a decision will be taken by my Department in relation to the issue of a felling licence for the site.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2045	Letters of approval have issued to almost 6,000 applicants for the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS), giving farmers a start date in the scheme from 1 September 2010. This represents almost two-thirds of all applicants and the processing of these applications was carried out within a challenging time-frame.My officials are giving priority to processing the remaining applications with a view to issuing further approvals as soon as possible.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2046	Further participation in the new Agri-environment Options Scheme will be determined by the level of funding available to my Department. All EU funding for the scheme up to the end of 2013 is now fully committed.  Any further support in that period will have to be funded entirely by the Exchequer and this is a matter that will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates process.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2047	Under the EU Regulations governing the Agri-Environment Options Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, all administrative checks, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Information System, must be completed before any payment can issue.Payment will issue at the earliest possible date once these checks have been completed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2048	A total of about 9,200 applications were received for the Agri-Environment Options Scheme, including 426 from County Clare. Letters of approval have issued to almost 6,000 applicants, of which 266 are in Co Clare.  My officials are giving priority to processing the remaining applications with a view to issuing further approvals as soon as possible.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2049	The position in relation to herd numbers is that, under Irish and EU rules relating to disease control and intra-Community trade in live animals, the herd number identifies a herd as a defined "epidemiological" unit and separate epidemiological units must be allocated separate herd numbers.  Being in one "epidemiological" unit means that the animals in the herd/flock on a holding share the same likelihood of exposure to a disease. This is the reason why, for example, when a herd is restricted for TB, all the animals recorded in the herd number for the holding, even if located in different land fragments, are movement ‘restricted'.My Department's policy, for many years, has been that, where lands are further than 20 miles/32 kilometres from the primary or ‘home' fragment, they should be assessed to determine if it is appropriate to allocate a separate herd number for the distant land fragment(s).  The main objective of this policy is to ensure that, in the event of a disease outbreak, the movement of animals can be easily traced and those holdings affected by the outbreak identified so that trade restrictions can be limited to these holdings. It should be emphasised, however, that the 20 mile/32 kilometres “threshold” is used as an indicator to trigger this assessment and, consequently, it is not automatically obligatory to obtain a separate herd number in all such instances.The assessment for a separate herd number is carried out on a case-by- case basis and takes account of the level of association between livestock on the home fragments and distant land fragments. In general terms, a separate herd number will not be required if any of the following circumstances apply: there are no cattle listed under this herd number on the distant fragments e.g. the land is used for Forestry/Tillage/Fodder or it is rented to or used by another farmer with a different herd number, there are cattle listed under the herd number located on the distant fragment(s) and the keeper visits/inspects the animals frequently;  animals on the different land fragments mix frequently as a result of moving between the various fragments such that all animals share the same disease risk.I want to stress that, in the event of a second herd number being required, it will not have any impact on Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlements and farmers can continue to claim all of the land fragments farmed declared on their SFP application using their existing claim  herd number.  The records available to my Department indicate that there are less than 2,500 farmers whose entire holding is registered under one herd number where parts of the holding are located more than 20 miles from the home farm.  The position is that, in such cases, movements of animals between the home farm and the distant lands are not recorded on the animal movement database because this is not required where all the land is associated under the same herd number.  Therefore, in the event of a disease outbreak, as it is not clear if animals were located on the distant fragments or home farm, the entire holding must be restricted and all the animals recorded in the herd number are movement ‘restricted'.  Furthermore, any holdings neighbouring both the home farm and the distant lands may, depending on the particular disease, be subject to movement restriction and herd culling and, in the case of TB, are assessed for testing. In certain cases, even though animals located in some of the lands on the holding may not have been exposed to the disease risk, my Department has no option but to treat them as a single herd as there is no record of the movement of activity between the land parcels.On the other hand, where a second herd number has been allocated to a farm which is some distance from the home farm, any restriction can, in many cases, be confined to the particular farm where the disease has been detected and trading can continue from the disease free herd (under its own herd number). In addition, any restriction or additional testing can be confined to the holdings which are contiguous to the farm where disease has been detected.My Department has been engaged in consultations with the farming organisations on this issue and the policy will be implemented as outlined above.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2050	The person named has not been in communication with my Department in the period since the Deputy's previous Question on his behalf.  As I stated in my previous reply, my Department was unable to accept his application under the Early Retirement Scheme because it did not satisfy all of the scheme conditions.Specifically, there was an issue with his proposed transferee's off-farm income in the year before the application, which is the determining period under the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme.  The fact that the proposed transferee may now have a smaller off-farm income does not change the situation.The person named was notified on 1 March 2010 of the reason for the refusal of his application and was informed of his right to appeal the decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2051	The recent surveys on decommissioning of fishing vessels were conducted as part of a Value for Money (VFM) Review, currently underway in my Department.  This Review is focussed on the decommissioning schemes from 2005/06 and 2008. VFM Reviews are part of the Government's long-term Expenditure Review Programme.  Their principal objectives are to ensure that analysis of the impacts of Exchequer spending is carried out in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed decisions can be made in the future. My Department identified the decommissioning schemes as one of its VFM priorities for the 2009-2011 round.  The surveys of vessel owners were part of the stakeholder consultation, which is an essential part of the VFM Review process.  The results will inform a report on the Review, which I expect will be published in the coming months.I have no plans for a further decommissioning scheme at present.  Any further scheme will be considered in the context of available funding and priorities for support within the seafood sector.

These regulations constitute the legal basis for Ireland's National Action Programme under the Nitrates Directive. The Regulations fall due for review this year.An Expert Advisory Group was established to consider the submissions. The Group presented its report to me and to my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government last week.  The conclusions and recommendations of the Group are now under consideration and will inform any adjustments to the National Action Programme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2054	The area for which the licences are sought is a designated Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 site).In the case of aquaculture sites located within Natura 2000 areas my Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of these areas.  This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  The comprehensive data collection programme together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives will enable all new and renewal applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.Once the relevant data has been collected, conservation objectives for the site have to be established by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The establishment of these conservation objectives by NPWS will allow individual licence applications to be assessed against the conservation objectives.  As indicated in my previous reply the area in question remains part of the package of prioritised areas under assessment.  This package is reviewed on a regular basis with a view to expediting the appropriate assessment process.My Department, working with the National Parks and Wildlife Service,  continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of these cases having regard to the complexities of these cases and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2058	The person named is not the Registered Herd Owner.  The registered herd owner does not hold any Single Payment entitlements.The registered herd owner applied to be considered for an allocation of entitlements under Category A of the 2005 National Reserve which catered for farmers who inherited or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The registered herd owner did not apply under the New Entrant category of the 2005 National Reserve.The registered herd owner was deemed unsuccessful under Category A as he did not submit documentary evidence to indicate that the land he acquired was received free of charge or for a nominal amount.  The registered herd owner subsequently submitted an appeal against this decision, which was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who disallowed the appeal.In a reply to a previous question from the Deputy in 2009, it was outlined that officials from my Department would contact the registered herd owner to examine his eligibility under the New Entrant category of the 2005 National Reserve.  The New Entrant Category of the 2005 National Reserve catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who did not receive any direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  In addition farmers are required to meet certain criteria in relation to off-farm and farm income limits and educational qualifications.  The registered herd owner was deemed ineligible as his off-farm income exceeded the upper limit of €20,000.  A letter outlining this decision issued to the registered herd owner on 1 September 2009.

Following processing, it was found that the reference area of one parcel was over-claimed by 9.06%.  Under the governing EU regulations, where the over-declaration between the total area declared and total area determined is greater than 3%, but not more than 20%, the area determined for payment purposes will be reduced by twice the difference for the crop group concerned.  The sum in question, €806.31, falls due to be recouped and will be deducted from the 2010 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme payment due to the applicant.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2064	An application under the Single Payment/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 23 April 2010.In relation to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.  My Department records currently do not show the person named as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density.  On satisfaction of this requirement, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.The person named has been notified of outstanding amounts due under Cross Compliance 2009 and REPS 2007, which will be recouped from any future payments due to him.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2065	An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme was received by my Department on 1 June 2010. However, as the closing date for receipt of applications under this Scheme was 17 May 2010, with the facility of the receipt of late applications up to 12 June 2010, subject to the regulatory penalty of 1% per working day, an 11% late penalty was applicable to the application of the person named.  The person named subsequently furnished my Department with satisfactory medical evidence covering the application period that allows the late penalty be waived.  The application has, therefore, been processed without any late penalty.The 50% advance payments are scheduled to commence issuing as and from 18 October, with the balancing payments scheduled to commence on 1 December.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2066	The person named applied for 36 animals under the 2009 Suckler Welfare Scheme.  Under the Terms and Conditions of the Suckler Welfare Scheme, for herds with more than 10 cows the calves must be weaned in at least two separate groups with each group being removed at a minimum interval of five days.The person named weaned all his animals on the same date, and therefore did not comply with the above measure. No payment issued in respect of these animals and the person named was notified of the position in a letter dated 15th June 2010. He subsequently appealed the decision and the case is currently under consideration with the review officer.  A letter will issue to the applicant as soon as a decision is made.

Full information on the extent of the loss among private forest owners is not available.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2071	The introduction of direct income support to farmers in the early 1990s resulted in the implementation of the Area Aid application system.  This system involved the obligatory  submission by farmers, who wished to apply for Livestock  Premia (Suckler Cow Premium, Ewe Premium etc.) and Arable Aid of an Area Aid application form each year detailing the land they were farming.  Since the system was introduced land, which could not be grazed by animals (including scrub land) was not eligible. This was always made clear to applicants in the Terms and Conditions, which were issued to applicants with their application forms each year.This situation continued  when the area aid system was replaced by the Single Payment System in 2005 in Ireland.  However, the provisions regarding the exclusion of scrubland remained unaltered.  The exercise referred to by the Deputy related to the exclusion of ineligible features, which were identified by examination of 2004 ortho-photo imagery of the land parcels claimed by farmers.  If farmers were claiming the ineligible features, over-payments were established for the years that these areas were included in the claims. However, the vast majority of the areas excluded by my Department for this period related to ineligible areas such as house sites, farmyards, forestry, roadways, quarries etc.The causes of wildfires in 2010 and the measures required to prevent such future fires are currently being considered by an inter-agency group (Land and Forest Fires Working Group) in my Department.  The Group will make recommendations to strengthen preventative measures and minimise the occurrence and impact of such fires.  Under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions associated with cross-compliance the burning of growing vegetation on cultivated or non-cultivated land (including permanent pasture) without approval is prohibited and could lead to penalties under the Direct Payment Schemes.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2072	My Department has granted approval for a 48 hectare pilot afforestation project on industrial cutaway peatland owned by Bord na Mona.

Therefore the Department does not collate the information requested.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2077	Analysis has been done by my Department, through COFORD (National Council for Forest Research and Development), on the environmental effects of forestry operations, including forest replanting, on peatland.The PEnrich project (Forestry Operations and Eutrophication), was a joint COFORD/EPA funded project which examined the influence of forestry and forest operations on water quality.  The project studied, inter alia, the influence of forest operations such as harvesting — clearfelling, thinning and re-establishment of forests in a blanket peatland catchment on the Ballinagee River, in the Wicklow Uplands.  The final project report is available from the EPA.  Another joint COFORD/EPA research project — "Quantification of Erosion and Phosphorus Release from a Peat Soil Forest Catchment (Xiao, L. Rodgers, M. O’Connor, M., 2008), examined the effects of clearfelling and reforesting in peat soil forest catchments.  The final report is available from EPA.In addition to the above work, my Department is currently funding a number of research projects which are examining, inter alia, issues relating to the impact of various forestry operations on peatland and other sensitive sites and the potential mitigation measures to avoid such impacts.  The SANIFAC project is carrying out an assessment and mitigation of soil and nutrient losses from acid-sensitive (peat) forest catchments and is due to be completed later this year.  The WESTFOREST project aims to develop a decision support system for the optimal management of forests on sensitive western peatland sites.  The project is focusing on forests established on peatlands and other environmentally sensitive areas, where felling and reforestation decisions need to take environmental factors into account.  The REDAREAS project has examined alternative management options for forests planted on western peatlands, including options for redesigning some of those forests to provide environmental services rather than timber production.The HYDROFOR project is a joint COFORD/EPA research project which is being undertaken by UCD.  The project is examining the potential impact of forestry on surface water quality with respect to acidification, eutrophication and sedimentation at the various stages in the forest cycle.  Work scheduled for Autumn 2010 includes a hydrochemical assessment of reforestation sites.  Further information on these projects will be available shortly on the Departments website.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2078	The definition of peat soils used by my Department is taken from Peatlands of Ireland, Soil Survey Bulletin by R.F. Hammond (1979).  It constitutes a peat layer greater than 30 cm on drained peats and greater than 45 cm on undrained peats.  It is not proposed to change this.The soil classification criterion used in the Nitrates regulations, the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice For Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009 relates to the application of fertiliser for agricultural purposes only.

Following an EU procurement exercise conducted by the Department of Finance, a mobile phone framework agreement was established to provide non-commercial public sector bodies with a streamlined procedure for the procurement of mobile voice and data services at competitive rates from a list of qualified vendors.The framework agreement is intended to maximise volume discounts and provide for reductions in administrative and transaction costs for providers and public sector purchasers.  My Department has run a number of competitions under the framework for its mobile voice and data services. Both O2 and Vodafone have been successful in separate competitions. In each case the successful vendor was the most economically advantageous tender.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2080	A solicitor for a person named has inspected documents for the two estates mentioned in the request in the Records Branch of my Department in Portlaoise. Copies of certain documents were given to the solicitor and inspection of other documents was facilitated.The only documents that were not available were the fair rent orders/judicial tenancies mentioned in the details. My Department has explained to the solicitor that these documents are in long term storage as a result of the transfer of Records Branch to Portlaoise. These documents are not readily accessible as a final decision as to where they will eventually be stored has yet to be made. It is the view of my officials that access to the records still sought will not add anything of significance to the answer to the substantive issue raised by the solicitor on record.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2082	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1678 and 1679 together.Following a recent Court judgement in the Netherlands the importation of mussel seed into that jurisdiction for the purposes of relaying is no longer permitted. The import of mussels for direct human consumption is not currently affected.However I am concerned about the possibility that the implementation of the Court judgement by the Dutch authorities has the potential to seriously disrupt trade in mussels between Ireland and the Netherlands.For this reason, my Department has engaged in urgent discussions with the Dutch authorities on the matter. In addition, Minister of State, Deputy Connick had a bilateral meeting with Ms Gerda Verburg, the Dutch Minister for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality in Brussels on Monday last. The Dutch Minister is aware of the issues involved and was made fully aware by Minister of State, Deputy Connick of Ireland's concerns in relation to the potential impact on the bottom grown mussel trade. Minister of State, Deputy Connick and Minister Verburg agreed to maintain contact on the issue and that their Departments would continue to actively engage at official level on the matter as a priority.Minister of State, Deputy Connick and Minister Verburg are both anxious to find solutions to the issue, which avoid the potential impacts on the bottom grown mussel trade which have given rise to concerns in the industry.

On 21 June this detailed update was also forwarded to the Dáil for circulation to all Deputies.The report contains details of the very positive response to all of the recommendations including those on Enterprise Development delivered through IDA, Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County Enterprise Boards, as well as in relation to grant aid rates, the development of industrial estates in Limerick and many other issues.   I expect to receive the final report of the Task Force in the coming months.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2086	The Annual Competitiveness Report 2010, published by the National Competitiveness Council in July this year, acknowledged that since January 2008, Ireland has regained some of the competitiveness it had lost at the start of the global economic downturn.  The improvement in competitiveness is closely linked to the policies the Government has pursued to restore stability to the economy.Some of the indicators of improved competitiveness can be seen in the fact that inflation remains below that of our main trading partners.  We are seeing lower costs for business, particularly in areas such as energy and rental of prime industrial space and office space.  Many local authorities have either frozen their commercial rates at 2009 prices or reduced them for 2010.  Wage costs have also reduced across the economy.   Exports of goods and services for the first two quarters of 2010 were up by 3% and 8% respectively, compared with the same periods in 2009.Along with my Government colleagues, I will continue to drive the competitiveness agenda across the economy to promote a business environment that is conducive to creating jobs.  In this context, the Forfás report “Making it Happen — Growing Enterprise for Ireland” which was launched on 24 September, presents a series of recommendations which are already aligned with Government priorities and which will help to improve the competitiveness of the economy and facilitate growth and job creation.Implementing the recommendations will require input across a range of Government Departments and agencies.  My officials will be working with the relevant Departments and agencies with a view to progressing those recommendations.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2087	I propose to take Questions 1684, 1702 and 1718 together.My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate claims from employers in general dating from February 2010 so that the waiting time is currently between 6 and 7 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, I am pleased to say that the processing time for these claims has improved significantly and claims dating from February 2010 are currently being processed.  This follows a dedicated intervention over the summer period to improve the processing period for lump sum claims.  For instance, in July 2010, my Department was processing lump sum claims dating from November 2009 i.e. an 8-month waiting period and, as outlined, lump sum claims dating from February 2010 are now being processed which represents a genuine improvement.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.I acknowledge the Deputies' concerns in relation to processing times overall given the difficulties which delays give rise to for employees and employers alike but would like to assure the Deputies that my Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I would also point to the fact that in the 8-month period up to the end of August 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 51,800, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (26,405) which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year 2009 (50,664).It may also be helpful to the Deputy to note that currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding 8-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.The claims backlog which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009 has been reduced to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) provides information to employees and employers on employment rights generally through its dedicated call centre.  As mentioned above, NERA is currently undertaking, on a temporary basis, the provision of information also in relation to redundancy specific claims lodged with my Department for processing.  This is assisting greatly in that it allows my Department to focus completely on the processing of redundancy claims to more effectively deal with the current claims backlog.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received statutory redundancy lump sum claims in respect of the individuals concerned in August 2009.  In general, my Department is currently processing lump sum claims dating from February 2010.  I understand that in this case, a delay was encountered arising out of a query raised by my Department that was subsequently resolved to satisfaction at which point the claims were placed in line for processing.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that both claims have been authorized for payment on 20 September 2010 and that the claimants should receive payment within 7 to 10 days of that date.

However, specific activation policies, or measures targeted at the unemployed or cohorts of the unemployed, such as the under 25s and the long-term unemployed, are the responsibility of my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills Ms. Mary Coughlan, through skills provision, employment programmes and work placements delivered mainly by FAS, the National Training and Employment Agency.  The Tánaiste works closely with the Minister for Social Protection, Mr. Éamon Ó Cuív to deliver on the National Employment Action Plan which is designed to reintegrate those in receipt of unemployment welfare benefits back into the workforce.In terms of the work of the Enterprise Development Agencies, according to the latest figures available, there are 120 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Clare employing 1,480 people together with 177 contract or part-time jobs.  Enterprise Ireland also supports the established business base in Co. Clare with a full range of financial and soft supports available to clients — these have included expansion packages, Employment Subsidy Scheme (ESS), Enterprise Stabilisation Fund (ESF), Innovation Partnerships, and Innovation Vouchers.  Enterprise Ireland approved €3,165,537 to client companies in Co. Clare in 2009, and paid €1,626,557 in grants.  So far this year, €1,731,524 has been approved with €1,832,292 paid in the same period.Clare has a strong Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) base. State supported FDI companies in the county are performing well and employ over 6,500 people.  IDA's strategy is to re-position the Mid West as a prime location for knowledge based industry and the agency is working closely with educational institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment.  In addition, IDA is working with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment.Shannon Free Zone is one of Ireland's leading locations for international business investment.  A key goal for Shannon Development is to ensure that the Zone's global brand recognition as a core location for investment continues to grow.  In addition to a wide-ranging physical regeneration of the Free Zone, Shannon Development intends to win both new and expansion investment by building on its unique and successful record.Business growth, job creation and job retention are inherent considerations in the activities of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs).  This year, Clare CEB has continued to assist micro-enterprises throughout the county by both direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters and through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice designed to help stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and boost employment creation and retention. So far this year, Clare CEB has approved grants totalling €360,350 to 27 projects with a potential for 34 jobs.  In addition, 14 training programmes have been organised for approximately 350 clients.In addition to delivering programmes through the Enterprise Development Agencies, my Department also works across Government to ensure that Ireland regains competitiveness, including cost competitiveness, thus improving the business environment and enabling companies to successfully compete internationally and grow jobs.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received statutory redundancy lump sum claims from the individuals concerned in 2009.  Due to the unavailability of supporting documentation from the employer, the claimants had to take a case before the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish their right and entitlement to redundancy.  Both claimants have recently obtained a positive determination from the EAT in relation to their case for redundancy and this has enabled my Department to process their redundancy claims.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that payments to both individuals in respect of their redundancy entitlements issued on 20 September 2010.

The greatest concentration of FDI industries is in Dublin.Table 1 shows the number of foreign companies supported by IDA on a county by county basis and by Shannon Development in the Shannon Free Zone in each year of the past 10 years.In the same 10 year period, a total of 261 IDA supported companies have been set up, while 28 FDI companies have been established in the Shannon Free Zone.In the past 5 years a total of 106 IDA supported companies have been set up throughout the country, while 8 Shannon Development supported companies have been set up in the Zone.  Table 2 shows, on a county by county basis, the number of IDA supported companies which have been set up in each year of the 5 year period 2005 to 2009.IDA is fully committed to securing a balance in regional development and one of the targets set in the Agency's Strategy "Horizon 2020”is that in the period 2010 to 2014, 50% of new or expansion investments will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.Frequently, competition for Foreign Direct Investment comes not from other countries but from city regions with populations in excess of one million people. Dublin is the only recognised city region in Ireland that meets this criterion. If FDI is to continue to contribute to balanced regional development the other regions of the country must be promoted as regions of scale with urban centres that provide the range of infrastructure and services that high value investment projects demand. This objective is being pursued under the National Spatial Strategy. IDA continues to vigorously promote the regions to potential investors.County2000200120022003200420052006200720082009Carlow8899888799Cavan111098875555Clare1312111010101010109Cork140138141141144145143141135134Donegal15141414141415141413Dublin670618544519500499505521504482Galway53525657575553525148Kerry21212021191615151514Kildare32323131303131292826Kilkenny8997777654Laois5655444444Leitrim5666666655Limerick42424143393937414239Longford7878777887Louth25221919181919202022Mayo25242523212019191918Meath18181816161616161514Monaghan7899777666Offaly1312111010109887Roscommon8888998888Sligo22222525232422192020Tipp North8756665444Tipp South12121212121211121211Waterford35353535333334333232Westmeath19181818171918202018Wexford16131312121211111111Wicklow26252425232220191817Shannon Free Zone84848279726966646560County20052006200720082009Cavan00020Clare00000Cork33234Donegal02100Dublin9611117Galway01215Kerry00001Kildare10000Kilkenny00000Laois00000Leitrim00000Limerick10440Longford00100Louth02213Mayo00000Meath00001Monaghan00000Offaly00100Roscommon00000Sligo10010Tipp North00000Tipp South00100Westmeath20311Waterford10001Wicklow00000

Data is compiled on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level.  The number of jobs lost in IDA supported companies, on a county by county basis, in each of the past 10 years is set out in the attached tabular statement.Each year an average of 7-8% of jobs within the IDA portfolio are lost as part of the normal business lifecycle. The reasons for this include competitiveness, market downturn, global economic trends and business model re-structuring, particularly as a result of merger and acquisition activity. However in 2009, in addition to the normal level of job losses, many IDA client companies announced significant reductions in their global workforces.  Ireland was not immune to these changes with net employment within IDA supported companies falling by 13,400 or c.10% from the previous year.   In excess of 3,500 of these job losses resulted from two high profile companies which included 1,900 losses in Dell, Limerick and approximately 1,300 at SR Technics in Dublin.  It is also noteworthy that 82% of job losses were as a result of downsizing, not closures. Maintaining a large number of existing multinationals here will help position Ireland as a competitive location when the global economy recovers from 2010 onwards.While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland.  Indeed IDA's performance for the first half of 2010 has been very encouraging and the Agency is on track to achieve ambitious Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) targets set out for 2010.  Up to mid July 2010, IDA already secure 63 new investments, of which 20 were from companies setting up operations in Ireland for the first time, 22 were expansion investments from existing client companies and 21 of the investments were in Research and Development.  A number of key trends are driving the current success in FDI in Ireland including the growth in the US technology sector, growing trends in Cleantech, an improvement in Ireland's competitiveness, currency movements and an overall global recovery in FDI.County2000200120022003200420052006200720082009Carlow56244949277331102622875Cavan34594276641276322656Clare5614220343223452351693Cork6851,8102,0571,3187857961,1591,6921,4882,432Donegal3415181234962173576441164829Dublin3,1408,2145,7175,2424,9364,1692,3744,0984,1966,805Galway3688371,2946504821935636197641,178Kerry875765132128423216147108416Kildare628495814714081484397175841,491Kilkenny1285015984920539112Laois3459431785248432016Leitrim73219528187117504330Limerick4571,0441,5836336051352564526942,519Longford12330495363020798874Louth7591,305276410117128287172433272Mayo12122846913740024310283126189Meath1061241409529143994183159Monaghan20183114640113161414Offaly3644412301084620759147118Roscommon42214214136111530189Sligo1572268026518111714925564137Tipp North521164942784834810046188Tipp South2539362673258130152693Waterford636233300224423579350183483569Westmeath11617117871925466312245264527Wexford131272981801513850597389Wicklow284574242564531,09729368296258TOTAL IDA8,41917,46415,14212,45010,3998,9178,2399,62310,06818,028

Nearly a quarter of a million quality Irish jobs exist today because of our long term commitment to make Ireland a location of choice for multinational companies.  At present there are 980 IDA supported multinational companies established here.  These companies account for 70% of total exports (€110bn) and are responsible for €19.1bn in direct expenditure within the Irish economy and account for 55% of the total corporate tax take.Over the past 10 years since 2000, the number of foreign direct investments approved annually has risen from 96 in 2000 to an all time high of 130 in 2008.  In 2009, that figure dropped back to 125, a drop of 4%, whereas FDI globally dropped by 30%.  Research, Development and Innovation plays a significant role in building Ireland's "Smart Economy". RDI projects now account for almost 50% of all FDI investments.  In the past 3 years alone (2007 to 2009), IDA has secured investments with total future capital of €5 billion plus  €1.2bn in R&D.Table 1 sets out the number of foreign investments secured annually in each of the years 2000 to 2009.Every year an average of 7-8% of jobs within the IDA portfolio are lost as part of the normal business lifecycle. The reasons for this include competitiveness, market downturn, global economic trends and business model re-structuring, particularly as a result of merger and acquisition activity. In the 10 year period 2000 to 2009 a total of 462 IDA supported companies closed with resulting job losses.Table 2 shows the number of closures together with the subsequent job losses in each year 2000 to 2009.DATAType2000200120022003200420052006200720082009No. of Projects App’dGreenfield64263133374139303539No. of Projects App’dExpansion32142431333032393924No. of Projects App’dRD&I39365054455662No. of Projects App’dTOTAL964055103106121125114130125YearNumber of ClosuresPerm Employmentat Year of Closure2000442,8602001636,9542002563,4482003402,9642004502,3952005291,6872006461,7592007422,1732008401,7792009522,950

Enterprise Demography Statistics are, however, compiled by the CSO under the Structural Business Statistics Regulation (EC) No. 295/2008 which entered into force in late 2007.  The latest CSO Business Demography returns for 2008 were published on 20 September 2010 and the Table contains information in relation to business start ups listing enterprise births from 2006 until 2008.  The CSO identifies potential enterprise births by using available economic indicators from administrative data (Revenue Trading returns in Corporate, Income, Employment and VAT activity).The CSO Business Demography Statistics coverage includes the following Economic sectors described using the NACE 2 Economic activity classification.B — Mining and quarryingC — ManufacturingD — Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supplyE — Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activitiesF — ConstructionG — Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcyclesH — Transportation and storageI — Accommodation and food service activitiesJ — Information and communicationK* — Financial and insurance activitiesL — Real estate activitiesM — Professional, scientific and technical activitiesN — Administrative and support service activities.*NACE code 64.20Activities of holding companies is excluded from sector K.For the purposes of the CSO Business Demography Statistics an enterprise is the smallest combination of legal units that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. An enterprise birth amounts to the creation of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event.

Cross-industry and sectoral collective agreements also apply in quite a number of these member states, as well as in the others that do not have a national minimum wage.  In many cases, these agreements stipulate minimum wage levels, above those set in the national minimum wage, that are generally enforceable either through legislation or other administrative measures.  While there are differences in how collective bargaining and wage-setting mechanisms are styled and operate across different member states, legally enforceable instruments such as Registered Employment Agreements and Employment Regulation Orders are not unique to Ireland.Collective bargaining arrangements of this kind do not fall within the competence of the EU.  Issues of employment and remuneration remain the competence of the member states and the social partners.  Moreover European Union law does not preclude member states from applying their national legislation, or collective agreements entered into by employers and labour, to any person who is employed, even temporarily, within their territory, although that person's employer may be established in another member state.Ireland's comprehensive body of employment rights legislation, including the terms and conditions set out in Registered Employment Agreements and Employment Regulation Orders, apply to all workers, including posted workers, employed in the State.  In this context, a posted worker is defined in EU Directive 96/71/EC as "a worker who, for a limited period, carries out his work in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which he normally works."  For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employee's (Part-Time) Work Act, 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2099	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 19 April, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims is between six and seven months and claims dating from February 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I would also point to the fact that in the 8-month period up to the end of August 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 51,800, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (26,405) which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year 2009 (50,664).  Currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding eight-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.The claims backlog which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009 has been reduced to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2100	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1700 and 1733 together.Table 1 sets out the number of statutory redundancies for the years 2006 to 2009 and provisional figures for January to August, 2010.  These figures reflect the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.Tables 2 sets out the monies paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2005-2009 and up to 31 August, 2010.  It should be noted that all figures provided for 2009 and to date in 2010 are provisional figures.During the period 1 January 2010 to 31 August, 43,449 claims were received and 51,800 were processed with an attendant value of €320m.In situations that employers provide proof of inability to pay redundancy entitlements, the Department pays the employees directly from the Social Insurance Fund.  In circumstances where proof of inability to pay on the part of the employer is not provided, or the employer refuses to pay the redundancy lump sum payments to employees, it is the case that the Department refers those employees to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to obtain a determination of their right and entitlement to a redundancy lump sum.  Where a positive determination is obtained from the EAT, this enables the Department to pay the employees directly from the SIF and the Department then endeavours to recover from the employer the amount paid out from the Fund — 40% in the case of employers where proof of inability to pay could not be provided and, in the case of employers who refused to pay the redundancy entitlements in the first instance, the Department seeks to recover to the SIF 100% of the amount paid out.  Lump sum payments are shown separately in Table 2.The Minister becomes a preferential creditor in a winding-up situation in recovering amounts paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and this debt stands against a company for as long as it remains live on the Companies Register at the Company Registration Office.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2101	I propose to take Questions Nos.1701 and 1703 together.Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the objective is to ensure that statutory redundancy payments, due to eligible employees on being made redundant, are made in accordance with the legislative provisions.  The legislation places the onus, in the first instance, on the employer to discharge the obligation to pay redundancy entitlement to employees.  In so doing, the employer is entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions made to the State, to recover a 60% rebate on the amount paid out in redundancy payments to employees.When employers provide proof of inability to pay the Department pays the employees directly from the SIF.  In circumstances where proof of inability to pay on the part of the employer is not provided, or the employer refuses to pay the redundancy lump sum payments to employees, it is the case that the Department refers those employees to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to obtain a determination of their right and entitlement to a redundancy lump sum.Where a positive determination is obtained from the EAT, this enables the Department to pay the employees directly from the SIF and the Department then endeavours to recover from the employer the amount paid out from the Fund — 40% in the case of employers where proof of inability to pay could not be provided and, in the case of employers who refused to pay the redundancy entitlements in the first instance, the Department seeks to recover to the SIF 100% of the amount paid out.The Employment Appeals Tribunal is a quasi-judicial body under the aegis of my Department.  I have no role in the discharge by the Tribunal of its quasi-judicial functions.  However, I understand that the total number of claims under the Redundancy Payments Acts to the Employment Appeals Tribunal recorded for the period January — 23 September 2010 is 2,189.  The figure recorded for claims under the Redundancy Payments Acts disposed of during that period is 1,639.It is not possible to identify those claims that have been submitted in order to meet a procedural requirement for payment by the Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The waiting period for a hearing of the tribunal for claims under the Redundancy Payments Acts can range from 27 weeks to 61 weeks. A pilot initiative, focused on achieving rapid reductions in waiting times, especially for cases involving redundancy payments, has been launched in Cork.  The initial results are promising with waiting times for redundancy payment cases dropping to 24 weeks (week ending 24 September 2010).Currently the waiting time for payment of redundancy lump sum claims in my Department is just over six months.  In instances where an individual(s) obtains a positive determination from the EAT, the redundancy payments section will prioritise the payment of those redundancy claims as soon as the employee can confirm, in writing, that he has not received any or all of his redundancy payment at any time from his employer.  When a hearing decision and an application for redundancy (form RP50) is available to the redundancy payments section a communication is issued to the employer asking him to confirm his inability to pay and to respond within a two week period.  Upon expiry of this period, the payment process is initiated which takes two to three weeks.  Delays in submitting the confirmation of non-receipt of payment, the EAT determination and the form RP50 can of course add to the timeframe.Unfortunately I am unable to give the Deputy the number of persons who were advised to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal because their employer had not provided adequate information to the Department as we do not collate this information and it would consume considerable resources within what is currently a very busy area of my Department to provide the information requested.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the main focus of the redundancy payments section currently is to dispatch redundancy payment claims to individuals and businesses as quickly as possible.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm to the Deputy that, on the basis of valid claims entered in the redundancy payments system in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim in respect of the individual concerned.Under the redundancy payments scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to the prevailing maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay which is currently €600.  Eligibility for persons to qualify under the scheme requires that:The employee must have at least two years continuous service (104 weeks) in the employment of the employer;The employee must be in employment that is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Full-time employees must be in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts; this does not apply to part-time employees;.The employee must be 16 years and upwards;The employee must have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation.It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and, if so, to notify my Department using an RP50 form which can be downloaded from the Department's website at  www.entemp.ie
Disputes in relation to redundancy entitlements can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.  The EAT is located at Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2 and the website of the EAT is a useful resource and is located at www.eatribunal.ie.

I am informed by IDA that:In February 2010 Generale PanEurope(GPE) and Generali International(GI) announced that they have commissioned a new building, which will be located in the IDA Navan Business Park, Athlumney, Navan, County Meath.  It is envisaged that the numbers employed will continue to increase over the coming yearsDuring 2009 BT Ireland announced that they will locate a 50 person emergency call centre operation in the Navan Business Park and are currently fitting out a 10,000 sq.ft. unit.Some other key client companies located in Navan Business Park include:Europ Assistance Holdings Limited whose employment has grown steadily over the past number of years to 170 in insurance related activities.PNC International who established their operation in Navan in 2006 and who currently employ in the region of 65 people.Welch Allyn Limited, who have expanded their workforce to almost 100 people in the production and development of medical device products.Availability of suitable land and facilities is one of the important attractions in encouraging FDI to Ireland.  In Navan, IDA Ireland has 25.5 hectares of serviced industrial lands available to market at the IDA Business Park in Navan.  The availability of these site options is widely circulated and currently IDA's property department are in active negotiation with three prospective investors who have expressed strong interest in locating new operating facilities in Navan Business Park.  These negotiations are expected to be completed shortly.With regard to potential future itinerary visits to Navan in 2010, it is not possible to project what level of itinerary activity will include Navan as these decisions are ultimately made by the prospective visitor/investor.  IDA is acutely aware of the need to increase FDI levels in County Meath and the availability of quality property options in Navan is a crucial element in these marketing efforts.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership-liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 4 May, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved significantly and claims dating from February 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I would also point to the fact that in the eight-month period up to the end of August 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 51,800, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (26,405) which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year 2009 (50,664).  Currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding eight-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.The claims backlog which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009 has been reduced to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

In the case of lump sum claims paid directly to the employee, the time limit for making claims is 52 weeks after the date of termination of employment.  In the instance of claims to redundancy entitlement that are referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal where there may be a dispute as to entitlement of redundancy, the tribunal has discretion to extend the 52-week time limit to 104 weeks, provided that it receives the necessary claim within 104 weeks of the date of dismissal and is satisfied that the delay by the employee in making his claim arose through reasonable cause.

Claims are not imported onto the Redundancy Payments System until a signed copy is received.It is also my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.

Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

Responsibility for the implementation of the scheme rests with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Eamonn Ó Cuiv and information in relation to the scheme is available from that Department.The County Enterprise Boards provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, including both financial and non-financial assistance.  The criteria under which funding is available from the CEBs is based on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise.  CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and can assist in the establishment, and/or development, of new and existing enterprises from individuals/sole traders, companies and community groups subject to the following eligibility criteria;the enterprise must be in the commercial sphere;the enterprise must demonstrate a market for the product/service;the enterprise must have a capacity for growth and new job creation;the enterprise must not employ more than 10 people;the enterprise must not give rise to deadweight or displacement.These supports include a priming grant available for business start-ups within the first 18 months, a Business Expansion/Development Grant available to micro-enterprises to help them grow and develop, a Feasibility/Innovation Grant available to micro-enterprises to assist with the cost of necessary pre-start up studies carried out for the purposes of assessing market interest for a proposed new product or service.Additionally, Enterprise Ireland continues to support the growth of new and existing internationally trading Irish enterprises.  A new Fund for Job Expansion has been launched by Enterprise Ireland, which will provide support of up to €150,000 to eligible clients taking on a development plan, which will increase employment.  Three calls for this competitive have taken place to date with a further call scheduled for November 2010.  The Fund will assist companies with regard to capital, technology acquisition, training, the recruitment of key managers, employment, and consultancy.

Information is provided by companies for statistical purposes only and due to data protection and confidentiality considerations, it is not possible to provide information in respect of individual companies.According to the survey, a total of 13,784 new jobs were created in IDA supported companies in the two-year period 2008 and 2009.  In the same period, Enterprise Ireland client companies created employment of 17,965.  In the period from January 2008 to September 2010, IDA Ireland made 135 announcements with the potential to create 12,763 jobs in IDA Ireland supported companies.  However, many projects go ahead without public announcement.  The comparable number of Enterprise Ireland announcements was 26 with an associated job potential of 2,224.The tables accompanying this reply outline the individual job announcements made in agency-supported companies in 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010.  Projects are generally implemented over a number of years with a time frame that can vary, depending on the specifics of the project.(announcements made over the period 2008-to date 2010)CompanyNo. of JobsDate AnnouncedShabra3509/09/2010Architectural and Metal Systems (AMS)3103/09/2010Probiotec5513/07/2010Weedle5020/06/2010E&I Engineering Irland7104/06/2010Eirtech Aviation7103/06/2010Netwatch2030/04/2010VoxPro160 Graduate Level16/04/2010Abtran30001/04/2010Aspen Connect1517/03/2010Openet3515/03/2010Probiotec3003/03/2010Newsweaver3319/10/2009Automotive Technology Systems and Research Ltd3020/09/2009Dublin Aerospace Ltd22602/09/2009American Pacific Corporation2020/07/2009Accuris2710/07/2009Abtran250 Graduate Level17/04/2009Taxback.com10003/02/2009EirGen Pharma2314/01/2009Async Technologies1121/10/2008Avvio3021/10/2008Dew Valley Foods5506/10/2008Houghton Mifflin Harcourt45010/09/2008Green Isle7031/03/2008Donseed2630/01/20082008 Job AnnouncementsDateCompanyJobs105/02/08Zimmer250208/02/08Unum200312/02/08Vistakon60412/02/08Channel Advisor15518/02/08Citco150621/02/08Service Source100703/03/08Teva165810/03/08DePuy20919/03/8IBM211025/03/08EyeWonder311131/03/08Thermo King191201/04/08Genzyme1701301/04/08Microchem/Lancaster Labs1001410/04/08Cameron1401514/04/08CognexN/A1617/04/08GlaxoSmithKline501702/05/08Pfizer1001821/05/08Satir401916/06/08IBM182017/06/08Business Objects1002118/06/08Solaris Mobile502201/07/08Coca Cola1002316/07/08Siemens602417/07/08Citi302514/07/08ON Semiconductor492624/07/08EMC502705/08/08Abiomed2502804/09/08Freightquote1002911/09/08Alcon1863017/09/08IBM343118/09/08Aetna703230/09/08Cook Medical2003302/10/08Facebook743423/10/08GOA4743524/10/08Pauwels Trafo703603/11/08Merck Sharp and Dohme1703703/11/08Marriott2003811/10/08Oriflame353920/11/08DTS504025/11/08IBM404130/11/08Coca Cola1004230/11/08Renishaw604301/12/08CSN Stores2004404/12/08Option Wireless145459/12/08Synopsys50469/12/08AON1004711/12/08Hovione804815/12/08Microsemi3154918/12/08PPD250No.DateCompanyJobs5014/01/09Trend Micro1005114/01/09Gala Inc505222/01/09Gerson Lehrman Group505305/02/09Computershare (CGS)125427/02/09Intel Ireland Ltd.Up to 1345510/03/09Hewlett Packard Ireland Ltd.500 (possibility to 1,000)5626/03/09PayPal Europe Services Limited355702/04/09Helsinn Holding S.A.,105809/04/09Big Fish Games, Inc1005921/04/09CIRS266025/05/09Cerner Corporation406128/05/09Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.5006214/06/09Sophis Group136314/06/09Wetzel256424/06/09Boston Scientific456525/06/09IBM1006630/06/09Rottapharm356702/07/09Abbott Mature Products Management Ltd506807/07/09Gilead Sciences306920/07/09AMPAC- ISP207028/07/09SuccessFactors407104/08/09Kenexa307212/08/09Lumension307302/09/09BSB207423/09/09McAfee1207528/09/09SITA807629/09/09Butterfield Fulcrum407705/10/09Equinoxe AIS507812/10/09PayPal1007916/10/09Citrix Systems208021/10/09Sajan358127/10/09Facebook708230/10/09HP Galway508330/10/09Buy.com408418/11/09Bentley Systems, Incorporated,1508514/12/09Wexport208614/12/09Merit Medical68714/12/09Sanmina-SCI8817/12/09Maxim Integrated Products100No.DateCompanyJobs8918/01/10Sajan, Inc.359019/01/10StreamServe209122/01/10PayPal1009226/01/10Freund Corporation259327/01/10Gala Networks1039403/02/10Alcatel-Lucent709509/02/10D & B1009611/02/10Hertz1009722/02/10Allianz Worldwide Care309824/02/10Warner Chilcott2009901/03/10PPD25010004/03/10HP6010104/03/10PAS Technologies1010222/03/10eBay15010324/03/10IBM20010430/03/10Citrix Systems Ireland3010531/03/10Dell10010614/04/10Generali PanEurope3010726/04/10United Technologies Corporation3710826/04/10International Energy Research Centre (IERC)5010912/05/10Mirror Controls International (MCI)5011013/05/10MSD15011120/05/10Telefónica10011221/05/10SAP/Business Objects7511324/05/10Webroot5011426/05/10EA20011531/05/10AXA Global Distributors20011601/06/10ENERCON3011701/06/10Straker2511809/06/10MFG.com5011913/06/10Zurich Group24012018/06/10Biotrin4012124/06/10LinkedIn3512225/06/10Spencer Stuart10012329/06/10FCStone2612401/07/10Merit Medical10012505/07/10Stream Global Services42512609/07/10Eli Lilly10012715/07/10UnitedHealth Group20012819/07/10Lumension2012920/07/10Covidien20013030.07.10Kelloggs5013103.08.10ServiceSource7013220.08.10Google20013301.09.10Helsinn1013417.09.10Fi-Tek5013527.09.10Otterbox50

Trade policy is an EU competence and the EU is currently either in negotiation currently, or already has Trade agreements with both individual countries in that region or with country groupings such as the Gulf Cooperation Council. Specifically on Iraq, an EU Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was concluded with that country last year.   Ireland's interests are taken into account in such negotiations and we can benefit from the terms of any such agreements.I am very conscious of the trade opportunities presented by the key economies in the Middle East and we have developed strong levels of economic activity, particularly with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  Next month I will be leading a Trade Mission with a large number of Enterprise Ireland client companies to both of these countries.  My Department held a very successful Joint Economic Commission with our Saudi Arabian counterparts earlier this year, at which various trade and economic cooperation issues were developed.The Government's new Strategy for Trade, Tourism and Investment, which was launched by the Taoiseach and myself yesterday, highlights the opportunities for trade with high — growth economies including those in the Middle East region and I am confident that we will continue to build on the progress made over recent years.

In addition, a second Life Sciences company visited Fermoy on 12 May 2010.  Both companies also visited a number of other locations and it is too early to say if these proposals will progress further.The ultimate decision on where operations are established lies with the client company, whose primary objective is to establish in the location most aligned with the business needs of the company.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2122	My Department officials have established that the Deputy is enquiring about a grant application to Longford County Enterprise Board (CEB).  As agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, the role of the 35 CEBs is to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.While my Department provides funding to the CEBs it has no function in the day-to-day decision making activities of the Boards.  The CEBs are independent companies, limited by guarantee and, therefore, legal entities in their own right.  Decisions on applications for assistance from the CEBs are made independently by the Boards, subject to eligibility criteria, on the advice of their evaluation committees.All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities. In addition to providing direct financial assistance, the CEBs also provide a range of indirect business advice and information assistances such as mentoring services, management capability training and development programmes, and e-Commerce training initiatives.Longford CEB is keen to support businesses involved in the renewable energy sector and have communicated their interest to the project promoter.I am advised that in the case of this particular grant application, the project promoter was advised by letter in mid-September 2010 that the application could not be approved at this time.  The CEB have provided considerable advice and support, including mentoring support, to the project promoter over the last 12 months and, whilst the Board have not approved grant support at this time, the promoter has been advised that upon further development of the project's business plan, the services of the Board, both financial and non-financial, remain available to the project.In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to him and to further develop the project's business plan, the project promoter should therefore maintain contact with Longford County Enterprise Board, Longford Enterprise Centre, Templemichael, Ballinalee Road, Longford (Tel. No. 043-3342757; e-mail: info@longfordceb.ie) to discuss the business needs with the relevant staff of the Board.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2123	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 24 September, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims is between 6 and 7 months and claims dating from February 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.I would also point to the fact that in the 8-month period up to the end of August 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 51,800, a 96% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (26,405) which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year 2009 (50,664).Currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first eight months of 2010 amounted to 43,449, a fall of just over 20% over the corresponding 8-month period in 2009 when 54,439 claims were lodged.   The claims backlog which reached its highest level at 43,000 in the latter quarter of 2009 has been reduced to a level of 32,137 at the end of August 2010 representing a reduction in the backlog of almost 11,000 claims.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

In addition, the number of Irish companies, which have established themselves in the country, has grown steadily.  The Chinese market has been a strong performer in the Government's strategy to expand and diversify our exports.  I have not been made aware of any significant problems encountered by Irish companies in relation to their obtaining credit for their exporting activities to China, because of Ireland's international credit standing.

It is 18 months in duration, with participants based for a minimum of 12 months in an overseas market (Europe excluding the UK, North America, Brazil, Russia and The Gulf). It has a strong focus on action learning and project work coupled with skills modules on relevant topics such as cultural diversity, market development/strategy, sales and marketing. The programme matches graduates who show potential with ambitious internationally trading companies and provides them with a structured means of developing new skills in business development, while also delivering a key project for the companies involved.Details are available for both companies and graduates at http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/G4IG. The closing date for applications was 27 September 2010.Enterprise Ireland's International Graduate Programme involves a placement of 2 years. This programme aims to provide 15 graduates with in-depth overseas marketing and business strategy know how. Graduates with primary and post-graduate degrees across disciplines such as business, social science, science, manufacturing technology and engineering who would like to make a career in international Irish businesses are eligible. Details are available on: http://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/About-Us/Our-People/Overview-Careers-in-Enterprise-Ireland.htmlGraduates taking part in the 2010 International Graduate Programme commenced working in their overseas locations on 27 September.Applications for the 2011–2013 programme will be invited in October 2010 and the closing date will be 31 January 2011.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2126	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to the prevailing maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay which is currently €600 .  Eligibility for persons to qualify under the Scheme requires that:The employee must have at least two years continuous service (104 weeks) in the employment of the employer;The employee must be in employment that is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Full-time employees must be in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts; this does not apply to part-time employees;.The employee must be 16 years and upwards;The employee must have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation.It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains and, if so, to notify my Department using an RP50 form which can be downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ieDisputes in relation to redundancy entitlements can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.  The EAT is located at Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2 and the website of the EAT is a useful resource and is located at www.eatribunal.ie.In the normal course, application for redundancy should be submitted to my Department on an RP50 form completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and the employee.  This form can be completed online or downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  In the case of forms submitted online, it is necessary also to submit a signed hardcopy of the form. Claims are not imported onto the Redundancy Payments System until a signed copy is received.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2128	I can confirm that my attention has been drawn to the difference in approach in the EU and the USA in relation to exceptions and limitations to copyright and "fair use" in particular.I should also mention that I have been approached by copyright and related rights owners who are concerned that their national and international rights are being eroded, especially in the digital environment.The issue concerned, in the broadest terms, is the difficult question of the delicate balance intrinsic in copyright matters.  On the one hand, owners of copyright and related rights are anxious to protect their rights and to obtain a fair return for their efforts; on the other hand, users are concerned to have reasonable access and use of copyright material.In the European Union, a series of Directives on copyright harmonise the copyright laws of Member States and comply with international treaties.  The directive that is most relevant to copyright exceptions is the Information Society Directive [Directive 2001/29/EC] which obliges Member States to provide for exclusive rights. It also introduces a regime of compulsory and permitted exceptions to these rights.  A technical reproduction exception is mandatory, while Member States may provide for the remaining listed exceptions at their own discretion.Copyright law in the United States contains exceptions and limitations that allow specific uses of copyright material. However, United States copyright law is exceptional among that of comparable jurisdictions in that it has an open-ended ‘fair use' exception that is not restricted to specific purposes.  This has led to a certain lack of clarity as to what are the exceptions, with the result that exceptions to copyright in the US have generally been defined by the courts. Ireland — in common with the UK (the source of the common law approach both in the Irish and US jurisdictions) — while complying with EU law, adopts a middle course in dealing with this issue.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 allows specific exceptions in relation to education, libraries, archives, public administration, disability, incidental inclusion etc.  Sections 50 and 51 of the Act also provide exceptions in relation to "fair dealing" for research, private study, criticism or review to an extent which will not unreasonably prejudice the interest of the owner of the copyright.If a US-style ‘fair use' type provision were to be adopted in Europe, it could result in a wider range of purposes being regarded by the courts as falling within an exception.  There are likely to be widely varying expectations about what these additional purposes might be.  These would probably then have to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the relevant court(s).  It is possible that courts operating in 27 independent legal systems might well take different approaches.  Technological protection measures and digital rights management arrangements would also have to be taken into account.The issue of scope of exceptions and limitations is currently being discussed in the European Union as well as in international intellectual property fora such as WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation). It is recognized that while the digital era presents opportunities in this respect, it also contains difficulties which have to be addressed. The EU copyright model of prescriptive exceptions is seen as a fair and transparent model.  Further exceptions may be added where appropriate.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2129	Table 1 below outlines the number of persons (full time equivalents), broken down by grade, employed in my constituency office and in those of my predecessors, including each Minister of State from 14th June 2007 to date in 2010.  It also includes the salary and overtime costs for each individual. These figures do not include Special Advisers as they are not assigned to constituency offices.Table 2 identifies the travel expenses paid to persons within each constituency office from 2007 to date in 2010.  In relation to constituency offices on Departmental property the following is the position. Since June 2007, a constituency office in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment/Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation in Kildare Street has been used by myself and my predecessors (Tánaiste Mary Coughlan T.D. and Minister Micheál Martin T.D.).  The dimensions of that office amount to 26 square meters approximately. Since June 2007, the only Minister of State who has been provided with a constituency office on Department property is the current Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation, Conor Lenihan T.D.   The dimensions of his constituency office amount to 31 square metres approximately. It is not possible to provide an estimate of the value associated with those constituency offices or to provide an accurate estimate of the costs of providing utilities, services and other miscellaneous costs for those offices because those constituency offices represent an insignificant amount of space within the Department's building in Kildare Street.Ministers since 14th June 2007June 2007 – May, 20082007200820092010

I do not anticipate that the staffing levels for my Departmental Group, including  the Industrial Development Authority and Enterprise Ireland, will have an impact on the Western Development Commission.I am examining all the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes relevant to my Department.   The Group's recommendation in relation to the delivery of indigenous enterprise supports through Enterprise Ireland also concerns a number of other Departments. A decision in respect of the recommendation will be a matter for consideration by Government in due course.  Responsibility for the Western Development Commission rests with my colleague, the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Mr Pat Carey.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2131	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1738 and 1739 together.My Department and the 8 Offices of my Department currently occupy 11 buildings within the State.  A list of the buildings involved is in the tabular statement.With the exception of a building in Shannon occupied by the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), none of the buildings or premises occupied by my Department and the 8 Offices of my Department are rented or leased by the Department or the Offices concerned.  In general, all buildings and premises occupied by my Department and its Offices are provided by the Office of Public Works (OPW) without any cost to the Department or the Offices.  In many of those cases the buildings/premises are rented or leased by the OPW and the information requested by the Deputy in relation to leasehold interests, building size, current rent, lease terms, rent reviews, break options, landlord service charges, car parking etc. could only be supplied by the Office of Public Works.NERA's Shannon accommodation is held under a four-year licence agreement between the OPW and NERA on the one hand and Westpark Shannon Limited on the other.  The licence agreement commenced in February 2009.  The licence fee, which was paid by NERA in 2009, amounts to €156.08 per square metre, subject to a maximum charge of €32,480 per annum (exclusive of VAT).  Since 1 January 2010 the OPW has assumed responsibility for the payment of the licence fee costs for NERA's Shannon accommodation.  The licence agreement provides for a review every four years. The first review will take place in March 2013.  NERA has also indicated that it is satisfied that it secured a very competitive rate when leasing its office accommodation in Shannon in cooperation with the OPW.All of the buildings listed in the tabular statement are occupied by the Department or the Offices of the Department.  Due to the decentralisation process and the reduction in staff levels generally in the Department and in the Offices of the Department in recent times, a certain amount of office space has become available in most of the buildings and my Department is currently engaged in a process to ensure that the buildings occupied by the Department are occupied to the optimum levels possible.Location of BuildingOccupant23 Kildare Street, Dublin 2Department of Enterprise, Trade & InnovationEarlsfort Centre, Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2Department of Enterprise, Trade & InnovationDavitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2Department of Enterprise, Trade & InnovationEmployment Appeals TribunalNERA Regional Office14 Parnell Square, Dublin 1Companies Registration OfficeRegistry of Friendly Societies16 Parnell Square, Dublin 1Office of the Director of Corporate EnforcementTom Johnson House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4Labour Relations CommissionLabour CourtGovernment Buildings, Hebron Road, KilkennyPatents OfficeGovernment Buildings, O’Brien Road, CarlowNational Employment Rights Authority (NERA)Companies Registration OfficeCentre Park House, Centre Park Road, CorkNERA Regional OfficeWestpark Business Campus, Shannon, Co.

All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.I wish to advise the Deputy that this application was refused on the 23rd June 2010 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or, in respect of non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or, where there is an officially recognized scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.  Furthermore, the Green Card Scheme is designed for high-level, strategic skill shortage occupations and the position on offer does not appear to fall within the Scheme.Having examined an appeal, the Appeals Officer upheld the original decision in this case on the 17th August 2010. As this application has already been refused and upheld on appeal, I regret that it is not possible to re-visit this application.

The report benchmarked industrial electricity prices for large energy users and for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) against a number of other EU Member States and the Euro area for 2009.The report shows that in 2009, the cost of electricity for high energy users in Ireland decreased by 24%, the largest decrease amongst the benchmarked locations.  The gap between Ireland and the Euro area average in 2009 was 5%, representing a significant improvement from the second half of 2008 when Irish electricity prices were 37% higher than the Euro area average. Electricity costs for SMEs decreased by 17% in 2009, again the largest decrease amongst the benchmarked locations.  The gap between Ireland and the Euro area for SME electricity costs in 2009 was 15%, down from a gap of 36% the previous year Comparisons with the EU average as a whole are not available in the Competitiveness Council report.Electricity prices have an impact on competitiveness and that is why the Government is working to ensure that we have a competitive, secure and sustainable energy sector to support the economy.  This objective is being facilitated by increased competition in the sector and by significant capital investment in the national grid.

The whole focus of Government policy on banking since 2008 has been to return the banks to a position where they can access funds and lend these funds on to viable businesses and households to support enterprise growth and economic recovery.Government has taken decisive actions in order to get credit flowing again to business.  The Bank Guarantee Scheme, the 2009 Recapitalisation Scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of the National Assets Management Agency have all contributed to the stabilisation of the banking sector with a view to facilitating the flow of credit.  The 2010 Recapitalisation package builds on the earlier initiatives and includes additional supports for enterprises, including SMEs.  In particular, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  This must include funds for working capital for businesses.Both banks have each published Lending Plans for 2010 and 2011 that include a sectoral and geographic breakdown of how they intend to divide up this new lending.  Implementation of these Plans is being monitored by the Credit Review Office.  While there has been some recent reported improvement in access to bank credit for small companies in June, July and August, I acknowledge that there is still a long way to go before the country gets back to so-called ‘normal lending'.  I am in regular contact with the main banks in relation to their lending to businesses and will, together with my colleague the Minister for Finance, continue to ensure that they meet their lending commitments.In developing any further initiatives, it would be important that they would complement, rather than substitute, the main banks' lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and also that there would be value for money from the taxpayer's perspective.Loan guarantee schemes can be designed to address known credit market failures for viable firms, such as low collateral or lack of market knowledge on the part of the lender.  My officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forfas to address these issues for viable SMEs including the option of a loan guarantee scheme.  Substantial progress has been made in identifying the critical elements involved in any further initiatives.

As the Deputy is aware, I do not have responsibility for the provision of transport infrastructure and I have highlighted to Iarnród Eireann my expectation that those bodies with primary sectoral responsibility in this area would further consider the proposal.  Given the resources available to my Department and the level of commitments that already exist, in particular under the CLÁR Programme, I am not in a position to make any commitment to this project at this time.

Under the Programme, eligible initiatives include the development of training facilities in rural areas and facilitation of distant learning through the use of new technologies.  The programme also supports the building of capacity of rural dwellers to utilise ICT, including internet to access e-services and other public/commercial electronic applications.  In this context, the project referred to by the Deputy may be eligible in principle under the RDP.  There are 36 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the individual group's local development strategy and in line with my Department's operating rules and the relevant EU regulations.  Contact details for groups can be found on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.

A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.A national model involving full integration of CDPs with Local Development Companies has been set out by my Department.  However, it was made clear from the start of the process that other options could be considered.  Alternative models were, however, required to meet a range of criteria, including a reduction in the number of structures, promoting the potential for integrated delivery of services to the public, supporting efficiencies and reducing company law compliance requirements for CDPs.I am pleased that I have been able to approve alternative models put forward by the HSE South, by the Limerick City CDPs/Paul Partnership and by the Women's Sector CDPs.  While the deadline for receipt of further proposals has now passed, a small number of other alternative models remain under active consideration by my Department.  The groups involved will be advised of the outcome shortly.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2140	I launched the ESRI Report Monitoring Poverty Trends in Ireland 2004-2007: Key Issues for Children, People of Working Age and Older People on the 7th September last.  The Report was commissioned by my Department as part of its role to monitor progress in tackling poverty and social exclusion in line with government targets.The findings highlight the significant progress that was made in reducing poverty between 2004 and 2007 for all lifecycle groups.  Specifically, the consistent poverty rate fell from 6.6% to 5.1% of the population over three years, a reduction of a quarter.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate declined from 19.4% to 16.5%, a fall of 15%.  There were significant improvements in the poverty rate for older people, younger children and children in larger households.  Among the working age population, there were large decreases in poverty among lone parent families and single people.The Report makes clear that these reductions in poverty reflect the policies adopted by Government in the mid-2000s, notably in terms of welfare payments. Other developments, such as higher employment and increases in the minimum wage, also contributed to the decrease in poverty.  Looking to the future, the report highlights a number of policy issues for consideration.Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government.  The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 introduced in February 2007 is to reduce the number of people experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The latest poverty results for 2008, published in November 2009, indicate that the Government is on track to meet this target.Despite the altered economic and fiscal circumstances, the Government remains committed to building a socially inclusive and fair society.  The overall goal is to restore economic growth, maximise employment and to protect those who are most vulnerable.  The ESRI report will make an important input in shaping the policy responses formulated by Government to achieve this goal.

However, while my Department was positively disposed towards the proposed development, it was not in a position to commit financial assistance towards it due to substantial existing commitments that fell to be honoured at the time.  In the context of the continuing high level of such commitments and the limited resources available, it will not be possible to commit funding towards this development in the short- to medium-term.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2145	Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government.  The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, which was introduced in February 2007, is to reduce the number of people experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The latest poverty results for 2008, which were published in November 2009, indicate that the Government is on track to meet this target.  The principal source of data on poverty rates is the European Survey on Income and Living Conditions, which is published by the Central Statistics Office every year and is available at www.cso.ie/eusilc/pub_rel_eusilc.htm.  In 2008, 4.2% of the population was living in consistent poverty.  This represented a fall of 35% from 2006, when 6.5% of people were experiencing consistent poverty.  In 2008, 14.4% of the population was at risk of poverty.  This is a fall of 15% from 2006, when it stood at 17%.  The CSO reports for 2006 to 2008 show that in the NUTS 2 regions, the consistent poverty rate in 2007, which is the latest year for which data have been reported, was 4.6% in the Southern and Eastern region and 6.7% in the Border, Midland and Eastern region.  The at risk of poverty rate in 2007, which is the latest year for which data have been reported, was 14.3% in the Southern and Eastern region and 22.6% in the Border, Midland and Eastern region.  The CSO reports show that the consistent poverty rate and the at risk of poverty rate in the NUTS 3 regions in 2008 were as follows: NUTS 3 regionsConsistent poverty rateAt risk of poverty rate%%Border4.616.5Midlands7.623.5West4.217.2Dublin3.59.8Mid-East2.310.2Mid-West3.522.0South-East4.415.5South-West5.714.0The CSO reports do not contain information on local differences in the risk of poverty in 2010 or in the past five years.  The overall decline in poverty between 2006 and 2008 highlights the critical role played by Government intervention in tackling poverty and social exclusion.  The key driver in the reduction of poverty was social transfers.  In 2008, social transfers reduced the at risk of poverty rate from 43% pre-social transfers to 14.4% post-social transfers, which represented a poverty reduction effect of 67%.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2148	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has responsibility for a wide range of programmes and schemes targeting community, local and rural development.  The key principle underlying our activities is the provision of support to enable communities to identify and address problems in their own areas.  The overall aim is to provide support to communities, in the most appropriate way, as they work to shape their own futures, address their own common goals and achieve their full potential.  In terms of encouraging and promoting employment, enterprise and community activity and participation, my Department manages a number of key programmes, including:The Local and Community Development Programme which specifically supports individuals into employment and self-employment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise and the social economy in urban and rural areas.  Funding of €67.5m has been made available in 2010 for the Programme;The Rural Development Programme 2007 — 13 under which funding of  some €425m is available for the purpose of improving the quality of life in rural areas and promoting the diversification of the rural economy;The CLÁR Programme, which provides co-funding to help accelerate investment in selected priority developments in areas that have suffered significant depopulation. Funding of €8m is being provided for the Programme in 2010; andThe RAPID Programme, which, through its focus on deprivation and social exclusion, seeks to address the impact of the economic downturn on vulnerable communities and to provide opportunities for social and economic recovery.As I said at the launch of the INOU publications, the changed circumstances in which we live require a sharpening of focus for us all in terms of addressing the nature of the problems which now present themselves. In response to the changing context in which disadvantage is being experienced, effective support at local and community level is a key part of the programmes my Department supports.

The Minister for Defence has no function in the administration of the society and does not get involved in the daily running of its affairs.  As a state party to the Geneva Conventions, Ireland is a member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  National societies carry out their humanitarian activities in conformity with their own statutes and national legislation.  They must always maintain their autonomy so they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the International Red Cross Movement.  The principles under which the society achieves its objectives are humanity, universality, unity, impartiality, independence, neutrality and voluntary service.  The society has certain rights arising from the Geneva Conventions.  The Government is required to discharge certain obligations to the society; for example, to ensure its independence.  The Geneva Conventions have been given effect in Irish law.  The society, while being a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, is legally separate and independent from the federation.  The federation acts as a resource, rather than a monitoring body, to the society.  It does not have a policing role.  The structure of the society is governed by legislation.  It is my intention that much-needed reform in this area should be progressed without undue delay.  I am confident that the recent appointment by the President of Mr. David J. O'Callaghan as chairman of the central council will help expedite matters in this regard.  The Irish Red Cross Society receives partial funding by way of an annual grant-in-aid from the Defence Vote.  It is important that Exchequer funds and funds received by way of public donation be properly accounted for.  I understand that the society is reviewing its processes in this regard.  The society has been the subject of intense media coverage recently.  Some of the coverage relates to internal matters that are the subject of ongoing internal disciplinary and legal proceedings.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on such matters.

Paragraphs 6(a)(i) and (ii) of the Regulations specify the categories that are eligible for enlistment i.e. “former members of the Permanent Defence Force who have had not less than one year’s full-time military service and who are not more than 40 years of age on offering themselves for enlistment;” and “former members of the Permanent Defence Force who, immediately prior to discharge, held the rank of Sergeant or Petty Officer as appropriate or higher non-commissioned rank and who are not more than 45 years of age on offering themselves for enlistment.”  Furthermore, paragraph 17 of the Regulations states that a former enlisted person of the PDF “may be enlisted in the non-commissioned rank last held by them if a vacancy exists in Establishments for a non-commissioned officer of such rank or, if such vacancy does not exist, in a lower non-commissioned rank in which there is a vacancy.”  Finally, paragraph 6 of the Regulations also states that applicants must “be of a medical standard as laid down from time to time by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support).”  Notwithstanding the current Moratorium on Recruitment and Promotions in the Public Service, the number of former PDF enlisted personnel who have joined the RDF in recent years is minimal, i.e. nine personnel in 2008; four personnel in 2009; and one person to date this year.  I wish to advise that I have no plans to make amendments to the current situation at this time.

The Defence property portfolio is kept under ongoing review to ensure the most effective use of military resources having regard to the roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  Any properties that are considered surplus to military requirements will  be disposed of and the funding invested to meet the current and future equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.

Each year, prior to advertising for a cadet intake to the Permanent Defence Force, the eligibility criteria relating to the previous competition are examined and any changes required are discussed with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers.  The cadetship competition was revised in 2005 to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force.  There are no plans to increase the upper age limit for cadet recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force.  Educational requirements are revised on an ongoing basis with the most recent amendments being in 2009.  All applicants for a cadetship in the Defence Forces must satisfy all of the eligibility criteria of the governing conditions for the competition.

The Department follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings: the direct cost, which is the cost that is additional to those associated with having the aircraft and only arises when the aircraft is flown and may include the cost of maintenance, fuel and support services, such as catering costs, cleaning services and airport handling charges; and the total cost, which is the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft, such as depreciation and personnel costs.  The average hourly costs associated with Air Corps aircraft used in the provision of the Ministerial Air Transport Service, which are kept under review and were updated in 2005 and most recently in 2009, are as follows:Aircraft2005200520092009Average Direct Cost Per HourAverage Total Cost Per HourAverage Direct Cost Per HourAverage Total Cost Per HourGulfstream IV€3,500€7,100€4,050€7,890Learjet 45€1,000€2,100€1,270€2,950Details of hours flown per aircraft type for the last five years are contained in the following table:YearTypeHours2006Gulfstream IV411.52Learjet 45232.672007Gulfstream IV281.33Learjet 45170.252008Gulfstream IV344.92Learjet 45234.332009Gulfstream IV220.42Learjet 45239.172010 (Jan-Aug)Gulfstream IV136.5Learjet 45104.6

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Prelude	2160	Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army, excluding Reserves, and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.  Ireland is contributing 148 Defence Forces personnel to 12 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.  The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the EU-led operation ALTHEA  in Bosnia and Herzegovina,  with 43 personnel and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 19 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.  Following the unexpected withdrawal of the Defence Forces battalion from Chad earlier this year, we are currently examining a number of options for future deployment. Contact has also been made with the UN in relation to its requirements for missions.  A number of options are being developed in terms of capabilities and possible missions. When these options have been further examined by Civil and Military management I will be in a position to consider the proposals and bring forward recommendations to Government as appropriate.MissionNo.
