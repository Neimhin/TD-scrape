#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I wish to ask the Taoiseach about a matter that has been raised by Deputy Enright and others on a number of occasions, which was the subject of a "Prime Time" programme last week.  I refer to the attitude of the Government towards accepting responsibility for what happened to a number of children in day primary schools throughout the country.  The Taoiseach will be aware of Louise O'Keeffe, who lost her case — in respect of which a sum of €500,000 in costs is pending — in the High Court.  The view is that this is a public interest case and that the State should not pursue Ms O'Keeffe for costs.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position in this regard?The Government wrote a letter advising victims that the Department of Education and Science has no responsibility in this matter and that they should pursue boards of management.  Under the Constitution, the State has a duty to provide for people's education.  In addition, teachers are paid out of the public purse and the Department of Education and Science sets down the curriculum, pays capitation grants and provides buildings.  Do the Taoiseach and the Government agree with the assertion by the Minister for Education and Science and her Department that they will not accept responsibility for what happens to children in primary schools throughout the country?  Do the Taoiseach and the Government agree with the contents of the letter that was sent?  If they do, they are abdicating responsibility completely.  If they do not, are they prepared to have it withdrawn and have some other system devised under which justice would be done and responsibility accepted?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	As the Deputy is aware, I cannot comment on the details of the O'Keeffe case, which has been appealed to the Supreme Court.  On the costs relating to the previous case, I made it clear last March that the Government had asked the State Claims Agency, the statutory body that deals with legal fees, to approach the issue of costs in a measured and sensitive way.  The agency informed Ms O'Keeffe's solicitor at that time and on the record, that while the same arrangements would have to be made in respect of costs, there was no question whatsoever of her losing her house, which was the issue.  Her solicitor informed the agency that she intended to appeal the case to the Supreme Court and it was not possible to make a deal with her on the previous costs.  In any event, the High Court placed a stay on the costs order pending the determination of the Supreme Court appeal.I have stated on many occasions that I sympathise greatly with those who were subjected to abuse in our schools and in places in which they should have felt safe and protected.  Child abuse, regardless of where it occurs, is devastating and victims always carry a great deal of emotional pain.  There is no doubt that a huge wrong was done to young children in our schools in the past.  While I feel deeply sorry for the victims, the courts have found that the State was not liable in this regard.  A number of cases have been heard in the courts.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Our education system has long been structured on the basis that schools are sponsored by religious and other patrons and run by local management on their behalf.  Since the enactment of the relevant legislation, legal responsibility in this regard is vested in boards of management.  The courts found in four separate cases that the Department of Education and Science was not liable for abuse that occurred in schools.  I accept that the State is not legally responsible for what happened.  That does not make matters any less awful for the people concerned, but the legal issue involved here is that the Department is not responsible.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Do I take it the Government, which has been led by the Taoiseach for the past ten years, does not accept responsibility for sexual abuse of children in day schools throughout the country?  Do I understand that evidence produced last week of a letter submitted to the Department of Education and Science, which clearly indicated abuse by a teacher, was not dealt with and that no action was taken?  I will ask the Taoiseach again whether he agrees with the letter that was sent to victims advising them that the Government has no responsibility in respect of this matter and that they should sue boards of management.  Such boards are comprised of approximately 20,000 volunteers and lay people.  Why would anybody want to serve on a board of management if he or she would be likely to be sued in  circumstances of this sort?  Is it not a fact that, under the Constitution, the Government must provide for people's education and that, for example, welfare officers, who have a role to play in ensuring children attend school, are part of the State machinery?Does he agree the letter sent out is in accordance with the Government views?  How can he stand here, as head of Government, and state that all responsibility is abdicated for children who were abused in day schools throughout the land?He apologised, in respect of the institutions arising from the Residential Institutions Redress Board, to all those victims who were abused in institutions.  Does he now apologise to all of those victims who were abused in day schools?  Let me hear it again from the Taoiseach, as head of Government, that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will not accept any responsibility for the sexual abuse of children in day schools, of which the Department of Education and Science was notified officially and took no action.  If that is the case, we have come to a new low where he will not even accept any moral responsibility for an outrage that happened in so many cases throughout the land.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Deputy Kenny is correct.  I apologised to those who were in institutions because in the institutions the State had a full obligation.  I have never stopped taking criticism from the Opposition in this House for that matter, but that is neither here nor there.Boards of management are not sued as individuals but as boards of management, and they have indemnity insurance on that issue, which has been made quite clear.  While members of boards have a responsibility to ensure procedures are in place to keep their pupils safe and to investigate any allegations of abuse, they are not personally liable for claims against the school.Boards of management are a corporate entity and can be sued.  However, the Education Act provides that the individual members who serve and who do a good job on boards, have protection.  In addition, boards are required to have insurance policies to cover this.  That is the legal position.It is important that there is local responsibility and vigilance, but of course this does not mean volunteer members of boards being exposed to claims, which is the concern that individuals would have.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The position is that in the entire history of the State primary schools have been State aided as distinct from State run.  The Catholic Church and other churches which have set up the vast majority of our primary schools continue to act as their patrons.  Other patrons include those of Protestant, Jewish and Muslim faiths, and the patron bodies from Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.  That is the way our school system is set up.The enactment of the Education Act ten years ago gave statutory expression to the status of the existing relationships between the Minister, the patron and board of management into primary legislation, and it is the school's management, rather than the Department, that recruits and employs teachers and other staff.  That is the legal position and that is why the cases have been dealt with by the courts on that basis.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I noted the "H" word was the only one that did not pass the Taoiseach's lips on Saturday night.  There was no reference at all of hospitals, not to mention private hospitals and the Government's plan to build super private clinics on the grounds of public hospitals.  There is not a single Member in any week of the year who does not deal with a number of harrowing cases of people languishing in queues for public hospital care because of the inequality at the heart of the health service intrinsic in the two-tier system.The two-tier health system will be worsened by the Harney plan, endorsed by the Cabinet and supported by the Taoiseach.  Up to now it was believed that people would be treated equally in accident and emergency departments.  Now there will be a two-tier accident and emergency system.Dr. James Binchy, speaking on behalf of doctors at a recent conference, stated that the following had emerged during discussions on new contract talks for consultants:Under such a system [the system of co-location], patients who opt to be treated privately will be admitted directly to the co-located private facility, while those who cannot afford private medicine will continue to languish in A&E Departments while awaiting a bed in the public system.The decision as to which patients will get a hospital bed will be made on the basis of the ability to pay rather than clinical need, Dr. Binchy said.When I asked the Taoiseach if he was going ahead with signing these contracts before the election, he denied he knew anything about contracts.  When I came back to it last week he stated that he thought it was going ahead, but he did not know, on 16 April.  Will he further worsen the two-tier divide in the health service by signing contracts, for which he has no mandate, for which he did not seek a mandate, which are not in the programme for Government and on which he is proceeding on the eve of a general election?  Is that still the position of his Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Deputy Rabbitte raised three points.

Currently there are several thousand private beds in public hospitals and there is no access for public patients.  We are endeavouring to build co-located private hospitals so that those private beds can move out of public hospitals and be designated private hospitals.  The same consultants would be able to work in their public and private capacities but we would have more access for public patients.  Accident and emergency units would not be affected.  Deputy Rabbitte knows that the Minister for Health and Children issued a statement on this matter last week.  It will not affect accident and emergency services.I accept the Deputy is opposed to this but we are trying to make more public hospitals available in the short term to people who are on public waiting lists.  With the increases in population and specialisation, we need more public hospitals, and this is one way of meeting that.  It is additional to all the new construction projects under way and the several hospitals which have been commissioned in various locations.  I do not see why anyone would be opposed to this.  It will help public patients and the efficiency of our consultants.With regard to what consultants will say about the industrial relations discussions on their contract, I wish Mark Connaughton and the other participants well over the next few weeks.Public accident and emergency units are not located in private hospitals.  Deputy Rabbitte does himself no good by trying to make the case that we will have accident and emergency units in private hospitals for the first time in the history of the State.  We do not have accident and emergency units in Blackrock Clinic, the Mater Private Hospital, the Bon Secours Hospital or the private hospitals in Cork and Waterford.  That has never happened nor is it proposed.  We are talking about putting public beds into public hospitals and have co-located private beds.  That is the proposal.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, did not seek any mandate for this policy.  He did not put it in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach knows there will be no accident and emergency services in the private hospitals.  The consultants are saying that patients will be transferred out of casualty units on the basis of whether they have private insurance.  That is how serious it is for the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who will rendez-vous with distressed and concerned people in the coming weeks.

While the Taoiseach refuses to answer the question of whether he will sign the contracts, even if he does sign them, we will do everything we can to examine the tax sections that allow the write-down in capital allowances to the investors who will build these super private clinics.  Investors who put their money into these super private clinics should be well advised that if it is legally possible — I think a Government always has the sovereign right to change a tax section — we will make those changes if this side of the House is returned to Government.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Deputy Rabbitte is entitled to say that if he is elected to power he will close the tax incentives for private hospitals.  There are no super private hospitals.  They are the same tax incentives that have given us 7,500 nursing home units.  If his policy is opposed to what we have created successfully, he is entitled to do that.Deputy Rabbitte may say that I am using weasel, sleeveen words, but that does not take away from the facts of the case.  The consultants are negotiating a common contract and they know the law well, as should the Deputy.  Road traffic accidents and other emergency services will pass through accident and emergency units and people will continue to go to public hospitals.  The Minister for Health and Children made that clear last week.  That is not the issue.  I believe, although the Deputy does not, we have a mandate for this.  We have a mandate to build additional private hospitals and public hospitals.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	156	This sounds more like an Ard-Fheis.  Last weekend the Taoiseach told the nation he had lots of money to give away.  Earlier the Committee of Public Accounts stated the Government wasted €13 billion, which is more than the Taoiseach had in mind.  However, the contrast is stark.  The message from the Government regarding mental health provision is that it cannot afford the most basic services.  The Irish Independent reports today that 5,300 pupils will be hit by the withdrawal of psychological services from 29 schools in Dublin and Wicklow.Did the Taoiseach see the media coverage of the court case involving Seán Ó Cuanacháin, a young Wicklow boy with autism?  Bearing in mind that the Minister for Education and Science welcomed the court judgment, did the Taoiseach see the boy's mother, Yvonne, stating, "The light of learning has all but been extinguished from Seán today".  I do not ask the Taoiseach to comment on the case because aspects of it are ongoing and I do not suggest there is only one method for teaching children with autism.  Given that Mrs. Ó Cuanacháin is seven months pregnant, spent nine days in the witness box, is a trained psychologist and only sought what her child needs — 30 hours of applied behavioural analysis a week, which would save the State money — does he welcome the outcome of the case?  Does he welcome forcing parents in that position into court to obtain the services their children need?  Following the case, will the Government provide funding for autism services such as ABA?  Will the Taoiseach ensure the waiting lists for an appointment for assessment, which can take up to two years, will be reduced?  Will the Government recognise ABA as a sufficient qualification for teachers of children with autism?  Can the Taoiseach seriously just sit there and welcome that judgment without answering these other questions?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I assure the House that improving services for children of special needs across a range of areas has been, and continues to be, a major priority for the Government.  We have worked hard to dramatically increase services in recent years.  This year €820 million will be spent on special needs education, which is an increase of more than 30% on last year.  A total of 8,000 special needs assistants are working in mainstream primary and second level schools compared to 300 on the day I became Taoiseach.  More than 7,000 resource and learning school teachers are in place compared to approximately 2,000 five or six years ago.Major progress has been made in the support of children with autism, which is the important issue raised by the Deputy.  The Department of Education and Science's preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism is through the primary and post-primary school network——

Autistic children in the school system have access to qualified teachers using a range of methodologies.Over the past few years, 182 special classes for children with autism have been provided in special and mainstream schools and they are attached to the schools.  We have provided five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome, 18 preschool classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention and 14 stand-alone facilities for applied behavioural analysis, the ABA specific methodology, on a pilot basis.

I have met the groups and committees working on this issue.  The Department's view and the expert opinion is that exclusive intervention through ABA is not the only way.  The task force on autism recommended that a range of resources and approaches be made available to meet the unique needs of each student with autistic spectrum disorder in all settings and the Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children, should be educated by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where they can mix with the wider peer group and have maximum opportunity for integration.  Pupils attending special classes in mainstream school benefit from the wider range of special teaching methodologies open to them, fully qualified national school teachers, a school structure and the option of integration into mainstream classes if that is suitable for them.I can well understand that a number of parents take the view that only one methodology suits their children but the State is providing——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The Deputy cannot say the effort and significant resources that have been put in and the ongoing work and research in this area are not a good response in this area.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	166	That is nonsense.

That is a huge improvement.  That is what the Government is committed to and that is what the Minister for Education and Science has been doing so excellently over the past number of years.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I must read between the lines.  Do I take it from the Taoiseach's response that he will not provide additional funding for ABA tuition, he will not recognise ABA as a stand-alone qualification and he is not prepared to reduce waiting lists for assessment?  I have to infer his reply from what he does not say as much as what he says.  Approximately one in 66 children is affected by autism and that number is increasing.  Resources will, therefore, have to be increased regardless.  Approximately 150 families such as the Ó Cuanacháins have been left with no option but to go to court to try their luck through the legal system because the State will not deal with their children in the way their psychologists have recommended.  Does the Taoiseach not recognise investment in ABA will save the State money in the long run?

However, in Donaghmede, parents are obliged to provide funds of €10,000 and in the ABA school in Kilcloon, County Meath, parents must find €12,000 monthly.  Parents must go into debt at every turn to try to do what the Government should, namely, to get analysis for their children.Is it acceptable for the Government to drive such parents into court repeatedly?  Is it acceptable to have groups such as NUI Maynooth engaging in a sponsored cycle this Friday to try to raise money to provide funds or to have entertainers such as Mr. Keith Duffy getting involved——

This is considered to be the best approach.  There are also special classes for different streams of autism.  There are 18 pre-school classes to facilitate demand for early intervention and 14 stand-alone facilities have been provided for applied behavioural analysis.  These are pilot schemes run by the Department of Education and Science.  They are not——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	194	It is the Government's priority to continue to expand provision for children with autism.  All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments for their pupils through the various schemes.  More than 4,000 such private assessments were funded in the school system last year.  The Government has continued to provide resources for this matter in every way possible through the various representative groups for autism with which the Minister keeps in regular contact.  Several support programmes to help them exist.In addition, on the phased implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, in the next few years parents who believe the needs of their child are not being met will have a process of mediation and appeal open to them.  This is likely to prove more appropriate and less costly than obliging people to go through the courts, which is certainly not the Government's preferred option.  The full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act will help in this regard.While many other issues arise in respect of autism, I will conclude by raising one more.  Students who attend special autism-specific classes have a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.  A minimum of two special needs assistants are provided——

Deputy Sargent should note this is already in existence.  Significant support is now available in the area of teacher training through an accredited autism-specific course, an approach-specific course, on-line courses and through special education.  Moreover, specialist school transport, equipment and accommodation is also funded.The State is doing an enormous amount to help——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	198	——and the Government will continue to have ongoing meetings with Irish Autism Action on such issues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 22, inclusive, together.On Monday, we were witness to truly unprecedented developments in Northern Ireland.  Anyone with any sense of the history and troubles of this island understands the significance of the meeting between Sinn Féin and the DUP and their unequivocal agreement to restore the devolved institutions on 8 May.  I know that everyone in this House applauds these developments which have the potential to transform the future of this island.I discussed the emerging situation with Prime Minister Blair on several occasions over the weekend and we also met in Berlin on Sunday.  We also spoke on the telephone immediately following the Sinn Féin and the DUP announcement.  In view of the absolute commitment to the restoration of the Good Friday Agreement institutions, we agreed to accommodate the new date of 8 May.  The Prime Minister and I will remain in touch over the coming period.  Emergency legislation was last night passed at Westminster to accommodate the new date for restoration.Northern Ireland has moved into a new and very positive place.  We will continue to assist the parties in any way possible as they prepare together for restoration.  I urge them to make the best use of the preparatory period now available to ensure the new Executive will be able to discharge its responsibilities with full and immediate effect from 8 May.  I welcome the announcement that the preparation for government will include regular meetings between the future First and Deputy First Ministers.On 4 February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I met with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Hain, in Wales.  We discussed progress on the Northern Ireland peace process and its assembly election.  That election, which was held on 7 March, was an integral part of the process and timetable agreed at St. Andrews.  The results of the election were a strong validation by the people of Northern Ireland of the St. Andrews Agreement.  It is gratifying that the parties have now responded to the will of the people.The improved financial package for Northern Ireland that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, revealed last week includes a substantial contribution from the South, which will result in improved linkages between North and South benefiting everyone on this island.  While the parties envisage further discussions on the package with the Treasury, I hope that what has already been announced will enable the new Executive to have the scope and opportunity to achieve real economic progress in Northern Ireland.As at all stages in the peace process, close contact is maintained at different levels with the British Government and with the political parties in Northern Ireland.  During my visit to the US, I had an opportunity for engagement with a number of Northern politicians and, together with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met a Sinn Féin delegation last week.  I continue to advance the proposal to establish a new joint Oireachtas committee on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Officials are currently working on drafting orders of reference for a new joint committee.I visited the United States from 13 to 16 March to mark the St. Patrick's Day period.  During this time, I visited New York, where I met the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, and key representatives of the financial services industry.  I also visited the Twin Towers memorial centre, spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations and met a delegation from the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.I travelled to Washington on 14 March and attended the American Ireland Fund national gala dinner.  On 15 March, I attended the Speaker's lunch on Capitol Hill and had meetings with a large number of prominent US politicians, such as Senators Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell.  I also met the Friends of Ireland group and the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board.On 16 March, I participated in the traditional ceremonies at the White House when I presented President Bush with a bowl of shamrock.  I then met the President in the Oval Office for discussions on Northern Ireland, immigration reform and several other current international issues.  The support and encouragement of the President and our friends in the United States for our efforts in securing agreement in Northern Ireland is greatly appreciated.  I particularly welcome the fact that the President was in contact directly with both Dr. Paisley and Gerry Adams last week.During the St. Patrick's Day period, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, visited Warsaw from 14 to 18 March.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, was in Ireland for St. Patrick's Day.  Detailed costs arising from both the Minister of State's visit to Poland and my visit to the United States are not yet available.

The Taoiseach is aware that Sinn Féin would have preferred the Executive and all the other bodies that arise from it to have been up and running as of Monday of this week.  Undoubtedly however, the Adams-Paisley agreement was truly historic and every effort must now be employed to ensure that the Executive and the all-Ireland Ministerial Council are up and running as of 8 May.  I ask the Taoiseach to outline the support measures the Government will undertake to advance all-Ireland development and strengthen the underpinning of the agreement.  Does he agree such infrastructural and other developments will be essential if the new Executive is to thrive and grow?  Will he confirm that among the infrastructural projects the Government is prepared to support will be an enhanced road service from Dublin to the north west serving Derry and Donegal?  Will he ensure the commencement of the long promised flagship project dating back to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, namely, the Ulster Canal project and all that can arise therefrom?  Does he agree that not only is it achievable but that it is also required that we ensure the full potential is realised with regard to co-operation in health care delivery in order that every citizen can benefit from the pooled health care resources, North and South?  The same applies to education and a raft of other areas.It is just over one year since the Dáil unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the British Government to establish a full independent inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane at the hands of British agents.  Since then further information has come to light on the extent of collusion between British forces and loyalist paramilitary surrogates.  This includes the report of the police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a vital part of the peace process and will he report on the progress made in pressing the British Prime Minister to fully co-operate?  With little time, presumably, remaining of the current British Prime Minister's tenure in office, will the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity to seek and secure a summit with him to specifically address this area?  Will he give us this commitment today?Will the Taoiseach advise us on whether before this day is out we will have sight of the details of the McEntee report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  What is he prepared to do on receipt of same?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The agreement is an historic landmark and an important development.  I am delighted we reached such a pivotal point in what has been a long process.  I would rather see the institutions being set up this week but having said that, the negotiations, agreements and understandings are even more important.  Undoubtedly, it is a golden moment and an unprecedented hope.  We all have to work to ensure it will happen.  We can see the agreement was front page news yesterday on every continent.  In the Middle East stations took an enormous interest and carried headlines throughout the day.  It is a good message that a peace process can work and make progress.  I know every peace process is different but at least it gives encouragement to many working on others.Anyone with a sense of history of the Troubles will understand the meaning of all of this.  There is no doubt that the meeting and agreement between Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams mark an historic juncture.  For the first time all of the parties in Northern Ireland have agreed on a way forward together.  It is hoped in the years to come this will prove to be unprecedented, very positive and welcome.  It is important that we move on in an entirely new spirit to implement all aspects of the agreement.  We have a few weeks to undertake a lot of preparatory work.  I am glad the First Minister and Deputy First Minister elect will engage directly during this period.  It is enormously important that no more time is lost.  We have lost enough but will be positive that this can happen.  I hope for a lot of early engagement and that everyone will agree that the delay is a price worth paying and that at least we can all sign up to it.From the Government's perspective, I can confirm the work we have done on two fronts on North-South bodies.  The staff of the North-South bodies and those involved in various Government agencies across the system are ready to move on issues which were held up and work on new ones on a North-South basis.  This was always the dynamic of the Good Friday Agreement and I am totally committed to this work.  We can make enormous progress in a range of areas without creating difficulties for anybody and are prepared to do so, as we showed during the interregnum period and through our support for Derry airport when major difficulties arose last year.Deputy Ó Caoláin asked about the financial package.  Last week the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced that Northern Ireland would benefit from an improved financial package on top of the measures announced on 1 November if the parties agreed to restore the Northern Ireland Executive.  This package consists of a sum of £35 billion over the next four years and will provide support for an £18 billion capital investment strategy during the next ten years.  The improved package also contains an additional sum of £1 billion, of which £400 million will comes from the Government to improve infrastructure and job prospects in Northern Ireland, specifically roads and infrastructure in the north west.In January the national development plan identified key areas for North-South joint investment initiatives which included a list of new strategic projects.  It is proposed to complete a high quality road network on the inter-urban routes linking the major population centres of Dublin, Belfast and the north west, including in particular the development of a dual carriageway standard road to Derry and Donegal.  This will remove the single largest impediment to the future development of the entire north west and the Border counties.  To make last week's announcement meaningful, we have provided additional resources which the Minister for Finance approved last week.I understand the British Government signed a retail consortium agreement with major companies to provide additional jobs in Northern Ireland and that the financial package also contains a commitment to carry out a review of the differences in tax rates, North and South.  This is an important initiative.  I have been supportive of the various groups lobbying for it during the past 18 months.Regarding the Finucane case, I met Geraldine Finucane in the United States.  This year a resolution was passed in the US Senate which was another important step.  There is great interest in the case, on which I reported at length at a meeting of the Friends of Ireland at which there was a large attendance, the biggest I have seen since 1998.  I should add that in the recent election a number of new Friends of Ireland were elected, including a number of young members.  This adds to our list of contacts for the future and I thank them for their engagement.  I brought them through the Finucane case, of which they were well aware, the various initiatives taken in the past year, the difficulty with the inquiry and the Government's stand on it.  Throughout the past year both the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I raised the issue at every meeting with the British Prime Minister and other Ministers.  I reported before on the difficulties and the position of the British Government so I will not repeat that.  We will continue to do this.It is not a question of having a separate meeting as every time we meet members of the British Government on this we put forward our strong views to Secretary of State Hain, other Ministers and the Prime Minister Blair, and we will continue to do so in trying to bring finality to these cases.I have received the McEntee report and I am trying to work my way through it.  I have not gone through it completely yet but there are a number of points on which I will have to seek legal advice from the Attorney General.  I hope to give it to him so he can deal with it as soon as I have got through it — my officials have just about got through it.  I will not delay and it is my intention, as soon as I receive the legal advice, to publish the report.On the provisions of the committee of investigations, I may not have got this right the last time I answered a question by Deputy Rabbitte when I stated that we would redact the names, as we did with other reports, but on checking that, we cannot do so with the committee of investigations.  I believed the case to be similar to the Barron and other reports, but one of my officials brought to my attention what I said so if I misled the House on the issue, I apologise.I must publish the report as it is and I will have to get the legal requirements right, but there will be no redaction.  The report will be published as it is given to me.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	202	All of us wished that the institutions would have been up and running in full from last Monday's date.  Nonetheless, what has happened is a landmark development.  I had the opportunity yesterday to pay tribute to the Taoiseach on his role and patience in bringing about that position.  What does the Taoiseach anticipate in respect of Sinn Féin's participation in the newly constituted policing board and the district partnerships?  Is that likely to happen this side of 8 May and will there be progress and development in that regard?I also ask the Taoiseach about the activity of dissident republicans.  I presume he saw the remarks made in the House of Commons yesterday by William McCrea, who asserted that arms were imported into Northern Ireland last week.  What, in broad terms, is the intelligence available to the Taoiseach on the threat from dissident republicans in that regard?North-South bodies have been on a care and maintenance basis since the suspension of the assembly.  Is legislation required in this House with regard to their functioning as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement?  I wrote to the Taoiseach some weeks ago in that regard and I wonder whether he has had an opportunity to examine the issue?  Will he state his position?  Was the North-South interparliamentary forum discussed during the negotiations and what is the position now?  This has been one of the outstanding issues since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.In respect of our contribution of €400 million to the €1 billion fund advanced by the Chancellor the Exchequer, is that contribution from the Irish Exchequer in addition to the allocation to the North-South projects as envisaged in the national development plan?There was some unexpected advice by the Government Whip to the Opposition Whips on 13 January regarding a North-South committee.  Is that still on the agenda and is it intended that anything will happen in this respect in the lifetime of this Dáil?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for his acknowledgement of my role, which I appreciate.On policing, I do not believe anything will happen prior to 8 May other than that discussions will take place.  The board will have to be reconstituted and I assume that will coincide with 8 May or it will be after it.  I do not think it will be reconstituted before that.  That will be a call for the Secretary of State but with the ongoing discussions and negotiations, they will probably be done together.  There was no particular endorsement of how it would be done other than that there would be co-operation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Does the Taoiseach believe it will be done quickly afterwards?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I think so.  There are no outstanding reasons it cannot be reconstituted and moved on.I have no particular information on the arms issue.  There are still subversive groups, though small in number and dedicated in their unhelpful mission.  They are still about and there have been some reports of activities, all from the usual sources.  They still take up quite a large amount of effort and resources.  There is always the worry that they can strike and create problems.  It is always when progress is being made that we worry most about these elements.  Up to 8 May there will be heightened surveillance of these groups.On the North-South issues, I have had the Deputy's letter checked by legal people and the Department, and we are almost ready to reply.  I will provide a lengthy reply, dealing with many issues.  The end result is that everybody who examined the letter, which contained good points, is satisfied that under the terms of the existing legislation, particularly the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, the bodies are fully and properly accountable to the Oireachtas.  They are satisfied the necessary legislation is in place to provide for appropriate parliamentary accountability of State bodies.  I will give the Deputy a full reply containing references and analyses.  The Deputy will accept that many of the points are of a legal nature, but I have had them cross-checked.With regard to the parliamentary forum, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is anxious for us to move on that.  When I attended the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body recently I spoke to members on the issues.  There is an opportunity now, in the parliamentary and the British-Irish forum, to get back to where we were.  It will probably not happen this side of the summer but we should try to get the parliamentary groups and forums together in the autumn, with a new Dáil and Assembly, with the imminent changes that will take place across the water.  The ideal time would be late September or early October, with all of them being done together.  Everybody is agreed they should go on so we should move on it.Discussions with the Government Whip are still active and I would like to finalise those issues.  We will probably not get much work done on them in the life of this Dáil but we could at least have arrangements made to start in a new Dáil term.  We could agree the arrangements or enhance them if possible.Regarding resources, the money will be additional to make the package meaningful, build on the initiatives of the national development plan and help the dynamics of last week.  As Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate, there was a lot of work in the background surrounding the events in the past few days, a big part of which concerned the economic issue.  For us to make a meaningful package and to work with the Treasury and Chancellor Gordon Brown, it was our considered view that we should take a wholehearted approach, which has been acknowledged by Dr. Paisley, Gerry Adams, the British Government and the other parties in the North.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I acknowledge the role of the Taoiseach and the Government.  The Green Party and all parties welcome the level of stability that has been brought to Northern politics.  Last Friday, I was glad to be in Stormont to meet my newly elected Green Party colleague, Brian Wilson.  The assembly is changing and developing alongside wider society.  Given that the category of "Other" in the assembly is growing, is there any hope there will be a reduction in the level of segregation, particularly in terms of housing and education?  Is it the plan of the Governments and the assembly to address these issues, which should be a priority if we are to have any reconciliation in society and not just between the politicians?Regarding all-island institutions, I would like to press the urgency of bringing forward the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children.  In the wider context of energy strategy, in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is interested thanks to his previous portfolio, what hope is there that we will genuinely and effectively develop on an all-island basis the energy revolution being discussed in the European Commission?  The Environmental Protection Agency is hampered by the fact it cannot operate as a single organisation on an all-island basis.  Does it form part of the Government's objective?Yesterday, the Cabinet discussed the long-awaited report of the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Are we to debate collusion before the Dáil rises?  I understood the Government hoped to publish the findings before Easter.  Will the Taoiseach arrange a debate in the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	207	We should have a debate on collusion.  It will be during this Dáil.  I thank Deputy Sargent for his remarks.On the first issue, we have invested an increased amount of resources in the American Ireland Fund, which is dealing with the issue of the segregation of education.  A large part of the money goes towards integrated education and the fund is making good progress.  It would have been a difficult area in Northern Ireland.  The large number of projects, albeit small in overall terms, are making a good impact and doing good work through committed people.As we move on and like the American Ireland Fund, a lot of our efforts must tackle the issues around sectarianism, to try to make changes that were not possible in the past and to breathe new life into the issue.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Yes, on the systems and allocation of housing.  The Deputy raised the children issue yesterday.  I have talked to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, about it and he has his officials working on it.  There is ongoing dialogue through the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, but we have asked to bring the matter to a conclusion.  In the interregnum, we will try to make progress.  We have moved a long way.The same is the case in respect of the all-island energy market.  Work is almost complete.  I have not been updated on it for some time, but it was at an advanced stage.  It should not take too long to complete.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	214	What progress has been made in equalising the corporation tax rate?  Some 68% of the economy in Northern Ireland is driven by public administration.  With a limited number of exporting companies, it needs serious attention if it is to grow in comparison to the growth rates in the Republic during the past ten years.  The Taoiseach realises that one cannot have an imbalance between the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties during the next decade.  Are there discussions on the matter or is Chancellor Brown making progress?  It is difficult, as others may want investment in different parts of the British Isles.Will the Taoiseach update the House on the provision of the North-South interconnector?  For a long time, the interconnector has been needed to apply downward pressure on electricity prices.  It would not be physically difficult to provide the infrastructure.I agree with the Taoiseach on the dual carriageway from Derry to Donegal, as it is a necessary and major piece of infrastructure.  The N11 or N16 road from Enniskillen to Sligo, which the Taoiseach visited recently, is bad and has seen a number of serious accidents.  Does that cross-Border infrastructure not deserve attention?  Despite the North-South business, that major artery is clogged and the NRA does not give it the priority it deserves.In the next decade, does the Taoiseach foresee a convergence of the economic development of the island of Ireland?  In due course, there may be political convergence, but ours is a small island on the edge of Europe, which is facing challenges from the United States and the Far East.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	215	The Deputy raised a number of issues.  Work on the interconnector is continuing and is well advanced.  Money in the national development plan has been provided for it.  We have been supportive of the Border corridor of Sligo-Enniskillen-Dundalk, as it is hugely important for the economic development of the region.  The last three Border roads will be open by the summer and will allow far more contact and activity, whereas many of the towns and villages were separated for three decades.On the tax issue, two good things have happened.  We will not see a change overnight, as I predicted.  I urged the parties not to get into that space on it.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, indicated in his budget this day last week that he intends to reduce the UK rate of corporation tax from 30% to 28%.  That, in itself, is a move in the right direction.  More importantly, during the discussions with Mr. Brown last week, to which we contributed, a commitment was made to carry out a review of the different tax rates between North and South.  I am pleased about that because that is what we required.  Until now, the groups lobbying for this change were talking about it in a general sense.The economic case needs to be made, as Deputy Kenny said.  The huge over-dependence on the public sector is the difficulty, as is recognised now by the political system.  The business community in the North has always acknowledged that.  There is an enormous imbalance in that regard.  I hope the analysis will not bear out the British Government's big fear about making the change.  It cannot be compared with Wales or Scotland.  That was just not going to happen as a political decision, the case had to be proven by economic analysis.  I am pleased about that.  It will not just be good for tax, it will also be good to see how we can integrate far more of the economic realities without upsetting people.I have been advocating co-operation on these issues for a long time, again without creating difficulties.  We need the same type of co-operation we have seen in areas like agriculture, fisheries and disease eradication.  There is no way we can sort out certain problems without working on an all-island basis.  We should try to do so in the health sector, for example.  The North has made advances in some areas, just as we have in other areas.  It is an ideal issue for co-operation.  In the education sector, the universities have been co-operating for the past seven or eight years.  Other organisations like the chambers of commerce need to get involved.  The trade union movement has always been organised on an all-island basis.  We need to focus on the dynamics of trying to get co-operation to work in a way that helps Northern Ireland and the South.  Labour market issues will be hugely helpful.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	216	When the Taoiseach met President Bush in Washington recently, he presented him with a bowl of green shamrock.  Does he agree that it might have been more appropriate to present Mr. Bush with a bunch of red clover to symbolise the blood-drenched cataclysm that he and the rest of the US Administration have visited on the unfortunate people of Iraq?  The fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq was four days after the Taoiseach tipped the cap to Mr. Bush.  The recent meeting may have been the Taoiseach's last time, in his current position, to meet Mr. Bush.  Did the Taoiseach ask the US President for an explanation of, or an apology for, the utterly fraudulent reason he gave the Taoiseach for the invasion?  Did Mr. Bush offer any such explanation or apology?  Many of us knew at the time that President Bush's explanation was an exercise in outrageous mendacity, although the Taoiseach professed to believe him.Did the Taoiseach discuss the future of Iraq with President Bush?  Did he ask him to get out of Iraq and to allow the Iraqi people to work out their future without the interference of the US?  Did the Taoiseach discuss with Mr. Bush the Government's collaboration in the use by the US of Shannon Airport for troops on their way to participate in the invasion and occupation of Iraq?  Did the Taoiseach pledge to continue that collaboration?Following the Taoiseach's discussions in the United States, what is the current position in respect of the tens of thousands of Irish people who are living in fear of deportation because they do not have the proper papers to stay there?  Did the Taoiseach get any new assurances, or any new hope of security, for those Irish men and women who wish to make their lives in the United States on a permanent basis and in peace of mind?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I discussed a range of international issues, including Iraq, with President Bush.  The Americans are continuing to work with the elected Government in Iraq to try to bring peace and some harmony to that war-torn area.  Certain problems are continuing to this day, unfortunately — a large number of people were killed in Iraq today.  I think the US Administration would be glad to be able to finish its mandate in Iraq by leaving a more peaceful society there, but that does not seem likely in the short term.  President Bush is of the view that the US is making progress in Iraq and is playing an important role in trying to bring stability to that country.  Deputy Higgins knows my view is that the Government did not support the war in its early stages because it did not have a UN mandate.  Obviously, when the UN mandate came some time later, we supported the US position.I met representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform during my recent visit to the United States.  The case of the undocumented Irish was one of the key issues I raised with President Bush, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs. Nancy Pelosi, Mr. Niall O'Dowd of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and our colleagues in both houses on Capitol Hill.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, keeps in touch with that campaign every week.  We have received a great deal of support on this enormously difficult and complex issue, which affects 12 million people, of whom between 25,000 and 30,000 are Irish.  The undocumented Irish do not present the biggest difficulty within the overall issue.  We need to try to reach agreement or devise some legislative formula that can be moved forward.Senator Edward Kennedy, who is the leading supporter of immigration reform, is hugely sympathetic to the Irish case.  The Bill he is proposing was approved by the Senate judiciary committee last year.  Everybody agrees that Senator Kennedy's Bill should be the starting point for a new means of addressing the issue legislatively.  He is having direct conversations with President Bush, people on the other side of Congress and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs. Nancy Pelosi.  We are supportive of this initiative and we hope it will be successful.  It is an issue of timing.  We have to leave it to Senator Kennedy and his supporters to decide when this Bill will be tabled.  I suspect that it will be introduced in the next month or two.  That will be an important step forward.  The support of the White House is needed if this legislative change is to be made.  We have the support of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  We certainly need the assistance of those who support Senator Kennedy, who is a senior Senator.  A 60-40 vote in the Senate is needed, in effect, if this is to become a reality.  Senator Kennedy is the only person who can get the necessary support on the Republican side of the house.  The support of the President is also needed.  We are trying to work with the three groups to get support for this measure and I think it is possible.

We are witnessing panic on the part of the Government to rush legislation.  On many occasions in the last term there was no legislation available to debate.  The need for the required accountability and scrutiny that Standing Orders must ensure is set aside by the Government on a regular basis to pass legislation on a rubber stamp basis.  Standing Orders were not designed to do this and we are opposed to such an approach.  This week the debate on eight Bills will be guillotined by setting aside Standing Orders.  It was the intention that Standing Orders would be set aside only in exceptional circumstances, yet there are eight cases involving non-exceptional circumstances where Standing Orders are to be set aside to allow legislation brought forward by the Executive to be rubber stamped.  We oppose this proposal.

On behalf of my colleagues in Sinn Féin, I make the point that this is an abuse of the House and will lead to deficiencies in legislation.

It was I who asked the question on the Mahon tribunal.

I had gone to lunch with the President of Slovakia so I was not actually there.

In page 12, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:2.—The provisions of section 1 regarding the manner of making nominations shall apply with any necessary modifications to European and local elections in lieu of the relevant provisions of the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 and Local Elections Regulations 1985 as amended by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002.This issue was discussed on Committee Stage.  It is related to the question of whether the legislation also requires to be amended in respect of local elections and the European Parliament elections.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that it was intended to bring forward amending legislation in respect of the Local Government Act, which applies to local elections, and the European Parliament Elections Act.  Arising from that I indicated that I would withdraw the amendment.  I invite the Minister to record that such  legislation will be brought forward in which case I expect I will respond correspondingly.I would like the Minister to address a related issue.  He will recall that when we debated the electoral legislation earlier this year the question arose as to the revision of the constituencies and the position vis-à-vis the census.  At that stage what we had available to us were the provisional census figures.  As we know the provisional figures, which were published last July, indicate that in the case of one constituency the ratio of population to Member of the House is in excess of that which is allowed for in the Constitution.  Second, it is likely that the variance that exists in the ratio of Member to population as between one constituency and another is outside the tolerance which has been allowed by the courts to date in respect of the principle of equality of representation.In response to those issues at the time, the Minister stated that it was his position and advice that what mattered here for the purposes of the Constitution was not the provisional census figures but the official figures when published.  I draw his attention to the indication on the CSO website that it is intended to publish the final official figures on 26 April by which stage we will have the official figures by area and by population.  Will the Minister inform the House as to what is his advice in respect of that?  If the general election does not take place before 26 April, which appears to be the likely scenario, what will be the position post-26 April if by then the official census figures are published?  As we know from past experience, it is likely that the official figures will confirm to within perhaps 100 or 150 the figures that were released in the provisional figures.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I thank the Deputy for raising both those matters.  He has raised a fair point.  As I explained on several occasions in the past, with regard to the census figures, the Deputy's latter point is correct in that the difference between the provisional and outcome census figures is likely to be marginal.  There will be variances when we get down to the level we need to get for the drafting of constituency boundaries.  Historically, that is where there have been significant differences.  We do not know the variances until we have sight of the figures.  The Deputy is correct in that it will be the last week in April that the CSO will publish the figures.  As I indicated, as soon as figures are published, I intend to trigger the mechanism which will appoint the boundaries commission, which will then have six months to report and thereafter legislation will have to be introduced.  That is entirely in accordance with the constitutional provisions, the law and the practice that has been adopted in the past.My advice is firmly based on Supreme Court judgments.  The position is that we use the final and not the preliminary figures.  Preliminary figures are simply preliminary and notwithstanding that the variation between the preliminary and final figures tends to be minor, the final figures are those specified in legislation.I agree with Deputy Gilmore that it is necessary to redraft the legislation for both local and European elections.  As I explained on Committee Stage, we have adopted a different approach than was previously adopted.  It was a case of picking a line and making a change which is an unsatisfactory approach to amending legislation.  We have therefore rewritten an area of this Bill to avoid having to refer back to various Acts and amendments and this is the appropriate approach for any electoral legislation as such legislation must be clear and holistic in its approach.  Deputy Gilmore is correct; it will be necessary and it is the Government's intention to introduce similar legislative change for both the European and local elections following the coming election or re-election.  I agree with the Deputy's view that it is necessary to rewrite the legislation in both those areas.  Whomsoever will stand here would take the same view.

Will the Minister charge the constituencies review commission with examining the massive changes in local government boundaries which have occurred and are already obvious in the census, with the intention of a review of those boundaries?  Will the commission review the crisis in some local government areas where city boundaries overlap with other county boundaries and there is not a consensus for future action?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Constitution does not specify that the figures used should be the final census figures.  The legislation which introduced the preliminary figures has not been tested.  A significant number of constituencies show wide variations which are either positive or negative.  It will be a case of constant catch-up because the census is held every five years and a Dáil term may be up to five years unless this is changed.  According to the 2002 census figures Kildare North would have been entitled to an extra seat but this seat is only now available for this election.  A constant catch-up is being played in the case of rapidly developing areas.  This problem will continue as the population is expanding and Governments last for a full five years.  Does the Minister favour changing or introducing legislation to allow for the use of the preliminary census figures?  Has his legal advice given any prospect of or danger of a challenge, given that it is out of line with the Constitution in a number of locations?  The Minister has refused to publish the legal advice but I ask him to inform the House whether advice suggested a challenge could be made.  The variation between the number of seats and the population is significant and the value of the vote is not of equal value as it depends whether one lives in a rapidly developing area or an area where the population is declining; this is not the essence of democracy.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I wish to pursue the issue further.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that the coincidence of election time with the publication of the census figures is giving rise to the mismatch.  What will be the composition of the constituencies commission which I believe is fixed in the electoral legislation?  What will be the commission's terms of reference?  Given the increase in population in the State, will the Minister give the commission any terms of reference in respect of the number of Members of the House?The sequence is the publication of the census figures on 26 April followed by the Minister triggering the mechanism to appoint a constituencies commission which then has six months to report and by which time the general election will be over.  Is it his advice that this arrangement is sufficiently robust to withstand any possible challenge?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	267	In answer to Deputy Murphy, my advice is that if I were to do something other than what I am doing, this would be subject to challenge.  A matter can always be the subject of challenge as any individual with the ways and means can challenge any issue in the courts.  It is certain that if I were to move in the direction which the Deputy is suggesting, it would be subject to a successful challenge because the court in its judgments has made it clear that the final report of the census must be used.The Deputy asked whether a change in law in necessary and this point was taken up by Deputy Gilmore.  It is always a matter that can be reviewed whether a principle may be changed.  However, it is only in relatively recent times that Dála have been running for fixed terms.  There is no provision in law for Dála running a fixed term; it is a coincidence that the last few Dála have run for fixed terms as will this Dáil run for its full term.  Changing circumstances always need to be borne in mind when legislation is being drafted.With regard to the constituencies commission, the terms of reference are established in Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997 and I do not intend to depart from it.  The membership of the commission is also specified in that Act.  It will include a judge of the Supreme Court or, following consultation with the President of the High Court, a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice who shall be chairperson of the commission.  The other members are the Ombudsman, the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  I do not intend departing from this membership.I have given an undertaking that I will trigger the mechanism within 24 or 48 hours, depending on the day of the week the CSO reports.  I accept the Deputy's point that it is somewhat frustrating to be in a constituency where the numbers have grown very dramatically and where a new situation may pertain but it would be even more dramatic if we changed at this stage.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	268	That was not my point.  I refer to the equality of vote, irrespective of which constituency I represent.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	269	This issue has been well tested.  The Deputy will be aware of the number of Supreme Court judgments on this issue.  The Supreme Court has spoken with clarity and I do not wish to do anything that would violate a decision which is constitutional in its nature and which has been handed down by the Supreme Court.  It would be criminally unwise for any Minister to do that.  There is a long history in this issue.  I subscribe to the general principle that there should be an equality of vote although the Constitution does allow a variation which in itself somewhat trespasses on the general principle.Deputy O'Dowd asked whether the commission will be examining local authority boundaries.  The commission will not be doing so because that matter will be considered separately.  The nature of the commission's examination is to consider local electoral divisions, LEDs, and where these should be drawn.  The commission is not charged with looking at the other matter which lies at the core of the Deputy's question, namely, whether it should be responsible for resolving issues relating to boundaries such as those that have arisen in, for example, Waterford, Limerick and elsewhere.  There is a separate mechanism to deal with such matters.  This could be, but has not been, triggered.  I am of the view that politicians should make decisions of that nature.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	271	There is no great problem where consent exists.  In Wexford, for example, the municipal boundaries were extended into the county council area by common agreement.  There is no such common agreement between Limerick city and county councils.  In the latter case, and in that involving Waterford, I suggest that a much more common sense approach, rather than a hegemonic attitude, be adopted by both the ambitious council and that which is trying to repel its ambition.  Representatives of the councils should come together and negotiate.Many of our cities and towns have historic boundaries that have nothing to do with modern considerations.  The last county was created in 1604 and the decision in this regard had nothing to do with Irish tradition or culture or the arrangements that preceded the shiring of Ireland into counties.  It is astonishing, therefore, that there is such vigorous support for proposals in this area.I attended a meeting of Limerick City Council at which major ambition was evident among councillors from across the political divide to change the boundaries and extend them into counties Clare and Limerick.  On a radio chat show at the time, a lady from the Clare side of the boundary stated that if I were to facilitate this change it would be the worst travesty of natural justice since the day the Wehrmacht marched into Poland.  Her contribution demonstrates some of the attitude of locals towards the proposal.  People in Kilkenny are concerned that if we were to cede part of the county to the city of Waterford it would have a major impact on the county hurling team.  Even though I was born and reared in Wexford and hurling is the sport I most actively follow, I would be rightly criticised by the people of Kilkenny if I was to eviscerate their hurling team's chances going forward.  Wexford will be obliged to find another way to defeat Kilkenny.I accept that point made by Deputy O'Dowd but I am of the view that, as has been the case in a number of instances, a smidgin of common sense would resolve the problem.  The work of the commission will not have a direct impact on that.

I agree with Deputy Gilmore that there are quite a number of matters that need adjusting, particularly in the areas of local government and European elections. These matters will be dealt with in separate and appropriate legislation. The point was made on Committee Stage that this is a better way to approach legislative change, particularly in the context of electoral law because it makes it readable. This approach should be taken in respect of local government and European elections.

In page 3, to delete lines 16 to 33 and in page 4, to delete lines 1 and 2.I welcome the Minister of State belatedly to the Dáil to take legislation which is before us again for a short time.  My objection to this legislation has been stated on Committee Stage and on Second Stage.  The principle of this legislation is all wrong.  It is giving full power to the Minister to operate as he or she sees fit in terms of European directives, resolutions and legislation and all European proposals may be transposed by the Minister as he sees fit, in his own image and likeness, so to speak.  This is an extraordinary power we are granting to the Minister, both retrospectively in the case of matters that have already been dealt with and in the future.  The Minister is almost like an alchemist of old who can turn whatever he wishes into a precious substance and guild it as he sees fit.  Not only will he transpose it into legislation, but he can amend it.  He can amend the legislation, providing for up to three years imprisonment for any citizen of this jurisdiction or up to €500,000 in fines.  Those are extraordinary powers the Minister is taking unto himself in this legislation.What he is giving us is a crumb.  He is prepared to put the European legislation on the floor of the House for 21 days, but he is not prepared to do so in the normal fashion in which it would be debated, teased out and legislated for, which is our business as legislators.  In that sense it is contrary to everything we stand for.  I am wholly opposed to granting these extensive powers.  This extends not merely to summary jurisdiction, but to indictable offences which involve the Minister taking much greater powers unto himself.As well as opposing the principle of this legislation, I am also opposed to the message it sends out.  I am sure the Minister of State was present last Sunday for the Berlin declaration, stating the benefits the European Union had granted over the past 50 years and the wonderful benefits which would be granted in the future, but there were quite a few elephants in that room.  There was no mention of the constitutional treaty or of enlargement, in other words, the issues that concern citizens and that caused the citizens of the Netherlands and France to vote against the constitutional treaty because they were fearful and suspicious of the lack of accountability in the European Union.If we are embarking on another 50 years in the European Union we must ensure we do so with the right principles, and one of the basic principles is that of transparency and accountability.  This legislation avoids all of that.  That is a bad start for us.We set up the National Forum on Europe so citizens could have a sense of involvement and engagement and we set up the scrutiny legislation — both emanated from the Labour Party — so the Oireachtas would have a scrutiny process, but now we are in a process of legislation which takes away a raft of such measures and passes them to the Minister, who can then determine how the legislation from Europe will be implemented.  That is not good enough.  It sends out entirely the wrong message.No doubt this legislation will be quoted the length and breadth of this country when we are putting through the next referendum on Europe.  When a referendum, whether on the constitutional treaty or another treaty, is put to the people, no doubt those eurosceptics who do not want Ireland in the European Union will point to this Bill and state the Government in 2007 in the Dáil took power away from the people and elected representatives and handed it to the Minister.  That, in itself, raises a serious question of European Union accountability.My amendment relates in general terms to that issue.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position and give us something more than the crumb he is allowing to be placed on the table such as that statutory instruments be presented on the floor of this House rather than laid in the Library for 21 days and that he give at least a positive presentation on any proposals he is putting forward.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Although I do not like repeating myself, I stated on Second Stage that this Bill is dangerous.  I will set out my reasons.  From the start my party has been pro-European.  We have seen our country and our people gain considerable benefits from our membership of the European Union.  A large number of problems arising from our membership hit some of our traditional industries hard in the early days, and my city suffered more than any other in the demise of traditional industries because of open competition.  On balance, Ireland has gained substantially through its membership of the European Union and I hope people recognise that.This Bill gives hostages to fortune to the opponents of the European Union.  As Deputy Costello stated, and we stated both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, this Bill will be used as a weapon against the supporters of the European Union in future referenda and in future debates.It will be difficult to get the support of the majority of the Irish people for the European constitutional treaty and there is a large hurdle to be surmounted in getting this constitution through.  There are a number of reasons for this.  There is a fear among the people and we must listen to them.  We should stop lecturing people on the benefits the European Union has given them.  We should listen to people's concerns and fears and enter into two-way dialogue with them.  Such dialogue has been attempted by the National Forum for Europe, but we are not being effective enough in getting out to the communities and, first, listening to people and then discussing their concerns with them.Their concerns include the drift of industry from Western to Eastern Europe and the loss of jobs to the newer member states, where competition is keener and costs and overheads are lower.  People are concerned about the ongoing enlargement of the Union and believe, to use a basketball analogy, we should take time out to consider the impact of the most recent round of enlargement involving Bulgaria and Romania, and the previous ones, and the long-term effects of that enlargement on the Irish economy and the Irish people.  While I support it, we must bring the people with us.  It is pointless lecturing people about what they have gained, as we must also meet their concerns.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will take on unprecedented powers under this legislation.  He is attempting to override domestic legislation through a statutory instrument and bypass the House.  The concession made by the Minister of State on Committee Stage, while welcome, does not go far enough.  A provision should be inserted to ensure a positive assent by the House to the statutory instruments introduced by the Minister of the day.  The Dáil should have 21 days to oppose a proposal by the Minister, if it so wishes.I am chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  Last year most of our work was devoted to regulations, decisions and directives, which comprised 69% of the total documentation.  Approximately 56 Common Foreign and Security Policy proposals were considered, including the application of restricted measures against countries such as Burma, Zimbabwe, Sudan and Liberia and against suspected terrorists.  On issues of such importance, we must not simply hand over absolute authority, retrospective or otherwise, to the Minister of the day.  I am not trying to increase the sub-committee's workload or make my job more important, given that the election is imminent but the next Government must take a realistic approach to EU directives.  The sub-committee should become a full committee of both Houses and adequate resources and powers must be provided to deal effectively with the avalanche of European documentation.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with it on a wing and a prayer currently.  We are dependent on a small but very professional staff and I marvel not only at the quality of their work but also at the volume of documentation they scrutinise.  They must decide on the implications for the State of all these regulations, directives and so on.The inadequate resourcing of this sub-committee coupled with the Minister of State's proposal in the legislation is dangerous.  Last week during Question Time I referred to the Government's failure to transpose many EU directives into domestic legislation.  The Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport are the greatest culprits in this regard.  Between 50 and 60 EU legislative proposals have not been transposed into domestic law because the system is not capable of dealing with the volume of work coming through.We are faced with a dangerous vacuum and the sooner it is eliminated, the better but that will not be addressed by giving the Minister of the day the right to sweep aside the oversight function of the Dáil and its Members and introduce by statutory instrument EU directives that will override domestic legislation.  It is wrong and dangerous because it undermines our sovereignty.  We will be hostages to fortune to the opponents of the EU who will be very vociferous in future referenda and I worry about this.  I have tabled a number of amendments, which I will not debate at length, and I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position on this and take on board a number of the reasonable amendments tabled by the Opposition.  It is reasonable to propose that a statutory instrument be laid before the House for 21 days for its consideration.  In the interest of all Members and the people we represent, that should be entertained.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The powers the Minister is seeking in the legislation represent a quantum leap.  Many people's nightmare that Europe would dictate to Ireland what should be done will become a reality.  While many positive initiatives have emanated from Europe, we should have a policy of critical engagement with the Union.  We should consider whether to support or oppose each new initiative on the basis of merit and criteria relating to its effectiveness, human rights compliance and whether it is good or bad for the people.  The legislation will take powers away from the Dáil and its committees and put them in the hands of a Minister.  One person who was asked for a legal opinion on this described it as an attempted coup by the executive arm of the State against the legislative arm, which is the Oireachtas.  The difficulty about these powers, some of which are retrospective, is that we do not know what we are agreeing to or what legislation is covered.My colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, tabled a number of parliamentary questions to various Departments about this legislation and most Departments are in the dark.  We are being asked to agree to the Minister deciding what regulations should be implemented without referring to anybody.  That is absolute madness and it is a dictatorial approach to this process.  To hand power exclusively to a Minister and his or her officials is anti-democratic and that view has been expressed by many Opposition Members throughout this debate.  It is crazy that, as long as the Minister claims it is necessary, European laws could be implemented without seeking the permission or acknowledgement of Deputies and Senators or even having to notify them.  I do not know how a Parliament could argue this is positive and democratic.A former President of Germany, Roman Herzog recently asked whether Germany could be called a parliamentary democracy because the EU drafts 80% of its laws.  That is our current position without the enactment of this legislation.  In 2006 the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny processed 329 legislative proposals, which amounted to 90% of legislation dealt with by the Oireachtas.  We are relying on the goodwill of the Minister and his officials to inform us whether it is good or bad.  What is being proposed here is wrong.  The nightmare will become a reality and many of us have spoken about the centralised Europe which seems to be developing.  We have argued against the direction Europe has taken in recent years and the undermining of countries' sovereignty.  We have asked whether we are moving towards a European super state.  The legislation certainly appears to be moving us in that direction and fewer powers are being given to sovereign parliaments.  Our arguments were rubbished by many people, who said we were anti-European, but this type of legislation is the nightmare becoming reality.My party will oppose the Bill at all stages.  We are being asked to agree to smoke and mirrors because we do not know what is coming down the track or what we will agree to retrospectively.  I do not see how anyone in his or her right mind could agree to these proposals if he or she genuinely believes in democracy or giving people the opportunity to scrutinise legislation.  This Bill will undermine whatever powers of scrutiny are currently possessed by these Houses and it represents the wrong way forward.  We are giving too much power to Ministers and it is anti-democratic, if not dictatorial.  I support the amendment but oppose the Bill.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Our reasons for being here are clear from the Title to the Bill.  This Bill arises because of the serious implications of landmark Supreme Court judgments in the Browne and Kennedy cases.  The court found that a statutory instrument to give effect to European Community law can only be validly made where the Oireachtas has specifically provided for it in the relevant primary legislation.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  For the past 85 years, the Oireachtas has passed primary and secondary legislation, and has given power to successive Ministers to bring secondary legislation through statutory instruments.  We are not asking the House to allow us to do anything that was not done in the past.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Following the judgments, a significant degree of analysis was carried out by the Office of the Attorney General and by all Departments involved in the transposition of European Community legislation.  This issue affects every Department, in accordance with the importance of Europe to our economy and society and the range of our European obligations.  The Attorney General advised at the end of this consultative process that new legislation was needed to fill the gap created by the two Supreme Court decisions.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	285	We all agree with that.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Supreme Court judgments mean that some of the body of legislation developed since 1973 could be susceptible to legal challenge.  Essentially, secondary legislation made in good faith over three decades by dozens of Ministers from successive Governments under the powers given to them by Acts of the Oireachtas may be in doubt.  The Attorney General's advice to the Government was that the issue needed to be addressed and that is the reason for the Bill before us.  Deputy Costello and others referred to this issue on Committee Stage.Our founding fathers and predecessors in government believed that secondary legislation was sufficient for the practical implementation of law and regulation.

That is the goal of the European Union and Ireland.  Members of all parties will work together on the constitution to the benefit of the EU and our country.  We have to be mindful of the role the European Union has played in modernising our nation and our laws and in ensuring we have an effective mechanism to introduce fair and equitable legislation.I pay tribute to Deputy Allen on the outstanding work he has done as Chairman of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  I salute him, his colleagues and the officials of the sub-committee.  Much work has been done in a quiet but efficient manner.  My Department is proud to have fulfilled its responsibilities under the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002.  The Act also obliges us to produce an annual report on developments in the European Union.  That is accessible and transparent to everybody and is an important tool for Members, citizens and Departments in terms of knowing the ramifications of any proposals coming from Europe.Deputy Allen spoke about the National Forum on Europe.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend the Committee of the Regions in Ireland, with the secretaries general of the committee and the forum.  The secretary general of the committee stated emphatically that the European Union believes that the National Forum on Europe is the best vehicle for communicating the European message to the citizens of Ireland.  He recommended that the forum be replicated in every member state.  This week, the forum will move to Deputy Allen's great city, where it will address the lifelong learning festival.  It is visiting the people in rural and urban areas.Reference was made to resources for the scrutiny role of the Oireachtas.  I have made it clear on Committee Stage that we are open to a review of the arrangements in place for Oireachtas scrutiny.  I fully support that.

The proposed strategy committee with an independent chairperson will have the role of delivering on this implementation.  On carrying out appropriate consultations, I will announce the composition of that committee.The finalisation of the national development plan earlier this year heralded the single largest capital allocation to the arts and culture sector in the history of the State.  A total of €904 million in funding in the culture sub-programme has been allocated to projects and institutions under the aegis of my Department.  The objectives set out in the sub-programme are entirely consistent with delivering on many of the recommendations of the NESF report.Until recently, other priority demands on resources in a growing economy, and the resultant pressure on the State's finances, meant that funding allocated to arts and culture, while on a steady upward curve, did not provide the Government with the wherewithal to undertake major investment in the sector.  It was not until well into the 1990s that it was possible to commit substantial investment to the national cultural institutions and the millennium wing at the National Gallery was the first landmark project to be realised.  The new national development plan provides a platform for greatly increased investment in such institutions, which will ensure the State will have both national cultural institutions of international repute and a network of world class regional facilities.The NDP includes funding for the development of a new national theatre and a new National Concert Hall on a public private partnership basis.  Considerable progress has been made on these projects which, when completed, will provide Ireland with state-of-the-art facilities for the benefit of its people and for its enhancement as a tourist destination.It also includes funding for major capital developments at the other national cultural institutions. The following key projects will be delivered over the lifetime of the plan: the major extension of the National Library, delivery of a number of projects at the National Gallery in line with the gallery's development control plan and a major programme of works at the National Museum at Collins Barracks involving the development of the new centre block exhibition galleries.  A building will also be provided to house the Asgard at Collins Barracks, where it will be conserved and proposals to locate a sports museum at Collins Barracks are under consideration.  Such projects represent an ambitious agenda for the next phase in the development of the major national resource that Collins Barracks represents.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Funding is also included for the enhancement of facilities and the provision of additional exhibition space at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, investment in upgrading the Crawford Gallery in Cork, which has been designated as a national cultural institution, further enhancement of the Chester Beatty Library, shared off-site storage facilities for the national cultural institutions and the provision of a new headquarters for the National Archives as a public private partnership project.The Government's policy on universal access to arts and cultural facilities will be furthered through the exploitation of technological developments that will enable it to begin a major digitisation programme for the collections in our national collecting institutions.  Digitisation will provide access to the national collections nationwide and from abroad.  It is an essential part of broadening access to elements of the national collections and will form the nucleus of public education in arts.  For example, it will enable the State to put on-line the collection of the National Library in every school in the country by exploiting the Government's recent investment to bring high-speed broadband to all 4,200 schools nationwide.  The digitisation programme will also take account of the North-South dimension.  My Department will lead this initiative and will act in partnership with the cultural institutions and the private technology sector to realise this ambition.The culture sub-programme will also take account of the North-South dimension.  There is close collaboration between the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council and I look forward to expanding the opportunities for even closer collaboration that should result from resumed political development.  The co-operation that is already in place for North-South tourism provides a robust model for what can be achieved.Funding is included for an enhanced arts and cultural capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, programme for grant aid towards the development of arts and culture infrastructure nationwide.  A new round of ACCESS will run from 2007 to 2009 and applications for funding under this round have been evaluated by an independent selection committee and I will make an announcement on grant awards shortly.  The primary focus of the scheme will be the refurbishment and enhancement of existing arts and culture facilities.  The ACCESS programme is a key element of the Government's regional arts strategy.Funding has also been allocated for the completion of major development projects at the Gate, the Gaiety, Smock Alley and Wexford theatres and for structural work on the Hunt Museum, Limerick. I am glad to report that the Gaiety and Wexford projects are proceeding apace and are on schedule.I have served as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism since June 2002.  This Government's record in arts, sport and tourism is one of which it can be justifiably proud and I was delighted to garner such significant and unprecedented funding for all three areas in successive Estimates campaigns and in the NDP.  In this fast-paced and vibrant economy, it is important to remember that economic indicators alone cannot measure a strong and healthy society.  The well-being of Irish society is also dependent on the vitality of its communities.  I believe strongly that the arts have a critical role to play in enlivening, invigorating and distinguishing our society, locally, nationally and internationally, and that Ireland's future economic, social and cultural success requires that appropriate priority be given to the nation's creative and artistic constituents.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I am glad the Minister has given a commitment in the House that he will establish a steering committee or a strategy committee to implement the recommendations of this report.  I was delighted to serve on the committee that produced it and am grateful that a number of recommendations I made have been included.The reason I welcomed the commitment made today by the Minister is that although the Arts Council and the Combat Poverty Agency produced a similar report with many of the same recommendations in the 1990s, they were not implemented.  Had they been implemented then, we would not be facing the same problems regarding cultural inclusion and social cohesion that affect our society today.  Does the Minister accept that many people are deprived of enjoying the arts to the extent they should because of their class, educational or socio-economic backgrounds or ethnic origins?Although the Minister has little time remaining to him, will he give a commitment that the Government will pursue a form of spatial strategy regarding the provision of facilities nationwide in order that communities will have access to arts centres and to quality performances?  One barrier that emerged strongly in this report concerned the issue of geographical location.  Those who live in remote locations have no opportunity to see professional performances because Dublin and the other major centres are simply too distant from them.  There must be a commitment to some spatial distribution of arts centres nationwide in order that touring parties can visit such locations to provide quality performances, as can local groups.  Moreover, the Arts Council requires a considerable amount of increased funding to enable it to provide funding for more professional touring groups to tour, thus ensuring that people can have access to quality performances.  The Minister should respond to these questions.

It goes without saying that people have not had equality of access to the arts in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  I would go so far as to suggest that sponsorship of the arts is a relatively modern phenomenon and that this may be the first Irish generation with the monetary capacity to engage in meaningful sponsorship of the arts.  I strongly believe the arts have a critical role to play in enlivening, invigorating and distinguishing our society, locally, nationally and internationally, and that Ireland's future economic social and cultural success requires that appropriate priority be given to the nation's creative and artistic constituents.In that respect, I believe the Government has made considerable progress due to increased funding for the arts and that programmes such as ACCESS I have been extremely successful.  I recently announced the establishment of ACCESS II and applications are being considered at present.  This will permit the continued creation of facilities for the arts nationwide in order that people may give expression to their creative talents.Digitisation is extremely important and I am pleased the national development plan provides for it as I campaigned for it long and hard.  For example, we will be able to make available the treasures in the National Library to every school and pupil in Ireland, thus enabling them to engage with the treasures held in the National Library.  Progressive digitisation will enable us to spread the arts across the nation in order that people will be able to participate irrespective of their socio-economic background, which is important.Continued investment by local authorities in tandem with the Arts Council in local areas is of immense importance.  While I do not for a moment pretend that all has been resolved in respect of participation, enormous ground has been made in a relatively short time and I do not doubt that the seeds sown will bear further fruit in years to come.

The report identifies barriers against young people fully participating in the arts and exploiting or capitalising on their latent talent.  The new Irish, particularly the African-Irish, have particular expertise in music and dance.  Will the Minister ensure particular attention is paid to them and that particular recommendations are made and actions taken to include these groups in any future strategy?

The implementation group will be established at the earliest possible date after consultations have taken place.  I am conscious of the need to involve young people, which is why we established the arts and education committee last year.  This committee had the task of formulating a policy to enable us to ensure the education sector became more involved as regards the involvement of children in the arts.  The report to be furnished to me in the not too distant future will give expression to this.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	314	As the House is aware, in January 2004 the Government agreed to provide funding of €191 million towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium as a 50,000 capacity all-seater state-of-the-art facility.  The recent decision by An Bord Pleanála to grant permission for the project cleared the way for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road to commence.This is an enormously important decision for sport in Ireland.  The new Lansdowne Road stadium will meet the needs of the IRFU and the FAI for hosting rugby and soccer matches, while also providing a platform to showcase the talent of our international teams to the world.  I congratulate the IRFU, the FAI and the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company for their vision, painstaking preparatory work and commitment to ensuring the proposed facility reached the present milestone.  I am informed by the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company that it envisages construction getting under way this May, all going well, and with an estimated construction period of 29 months the facility should be ready in late 2009 or early 2010.Last week's decision also means we can begin to engage seriously with UEFA on its announcement last year that it was prepared to host either a Champions League or UEFA Cup final in the stadium when completed.  The development of Lansdowne Road is hugely significant in economic terms and the new stadium will undoubtedly be a valuable asset in attracting an increased number of supporters and visitors to Dublin when major games are played.  Reports commissioned by the IRFU estimated that a rugby international against England could generate in the region of €52 million for the economy.With regard to the Deputy's reference to possible further challenges, legal or otherwise, Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company engaged in a sustained consultative process with local residents and other bodies in the course of which it worked hard to fully understand and take on board real concerns to the greatest extent possible.  I am confident this positive framework of consultation and constructive engagement will continue as the project moves into the construction and completion phases.In concluding my response to these questions I would like to reflect for one moment on the cultural significance of what is about to commence at Lansdowne Road.  The stadium has been part of Dublin history for 135 years, beginning in 1872 as a multi-sports venue for athletics, cricket, croquet, football, archery and lawn tennis and a little later hosting its first international rugby fixture in 1878.  Many great sporting moments are associated with the stadium and successive generations of Dubliners and others have their own particular memories of great victories and dramatic defeats, whether in international rugby, soccer or the many other sports events held there throughout the decades.  It is a matter of great satisfaction that this element of Dublin has survived from the heyday of Charles Stewart Parnell and will host fixtures that will enthrall Irish sports fans long into the 21st century.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thank the Minister for his documentative reply.  This side of the House agrees with and fully supports the development of Lansdowne Road.  I have a number of questions and would appreciate it if the Minister answered them.  In recent days we saw the findings of a number of surveys which stated alcohol was associated with sport to too high a degree.  The new Lansdowne Road stadium will have a total of 2,410 sq. m of bar and licensed restaurant facilities.  Croke Park also has such facilities.  Is the Minister concerned that once again we must associate alcohol with the development of our national stadia?  Must they go hand in hand or can we get the maximum benefit from them without the influence of alcohol?  Is alcohol a major player in attracting attendances on the day?  Is it fair to state we should ensure the strict criteria which I am sure are in place are adhered to with regard to opening hours for the sale of alcohol in such stadia?Statements were made with regard to the Dodder and the fact that Dublin City Council must determine the sale of a strip of land adjacent to river to the development company to allow it ensure development of the stadium.  Will the Minister comment on this?Does the Minister still stand over the statement that the maximum funding to be provided by the Department is €190 million?  Why will that money be paid upfront rather than in stages?  Was it a request from the IRFU and the FAI or did the Government decide to make the payment upfront and allow the two associations to develop the project?  What was the idea behind it?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The provision of bar facilities at the new Lansdowne Road stadium is part of the plan.  It should be remembered that often modern stadia are not used solely for the purposes of sport.  Croke Park is often used for major conferences.  In the same way, I anticipate meetings and smaller conferences will take place at Lansdowne Road.  Therefore, I anticipate a need for restaurant and bar facilities and it is only natural that these facilities would form part of the plans.  It is not the intention of the Lansdowne Road Stadium Development Company nor mine to promote the sale of drink, far from it.Regarding the Dodder river walkway, an international sized rugby pitch will be provided at the rear of the East Stand to be used by Wanderers and Lansdowne rugby clubs.  This development requires a small strip of land along the Dodder river walkway.  Dublin City Council was approached with this request and is fully aware of what is involved.  Discussions are continuing.  In return, land along the Dodder river just outside the stadium will be upgraded and improved in order that there will continue to be a Dodder walkway from Lansdowne Road to Bath Avenue.  The existing amenity will not be removed.Engagement with other statutory agencies will be necessary as we progress with construction.  There will be a necessity to have talks and reach agreement with Iarnród Éireann.The entire cost is €365 million, of which the Exchequer will provide €191 million.  Expenditure to date is approximately €23 million which was spent on matters such as design.  The Department's Vote this year made provision for expenditure of €56 million in anticipation of An Bord Pleanála granting planning permission.  I am glad to state it did so.  In the circumstances, it is clear that Exchequer funding to be provided in the period from now to the end of construction will be staggered.  It is true that the FAI and IRFU will come in at a later stage with their contributions.  The reason is that to a large extent, their funds will be raised by way of selling corporate box advance tickets.  They are confident they will each raise the required share of funding in accordance with the agreement.It is the Government's intention to provide €191 million, which has been the aim since the beginning.  It remains the position that the Government is committed to the provision of €191 million and no more.  As of now, we hope to see construction commence in May this year, with construction of the new stadium completed by the end of 2009.  This would mean we have met every single deadline since the commencement of the project.

This is the successor to the highly successful ACCESS I scheme, introduced in August 2001, which allocated funding of almost €43 million to 40 projects nationwide.ACCESS has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of high quality arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  Under the new scheme, 70% of the funds will be directed towards the enhancement and refurbishment of existing facilities, with 30% available for new facilities.An independent selection committee has just completed the assessment of the applications and has, in recent days, completed its report for my consideration.  I am currently examining this report and hope to make an announcement regarding the successful applicants shortly.

I understand there was to be an announcement before the end of March, so when will the Minister make the announcement?  The Minister has stated he is considering the report but will his announcement come before the end of March, as was originally promised?Is the Minister aware of the success of the local Garage Theatre in Monaghan over the past 14 years?  Excellent work has been done by the CEO of the VEC, Mr. Larry McCluskey, and his staff at the theatre there.  There were many sceptics at the beginning but it has worked out and the facility is very successful.Does the Minister consider the facilities in the Garage Theatre to be totally inadequate for professional artists and local audiences?  That is no fault of the theatre staff and administrators, who are dedicated and hard working.  Is the Minister also aware that despite the shortcomings, the theatre has enjoyed notable success in fostering individual artistic talent, not just at local level but also at the national level?Does the Minister agree the existing arts infrastructure in Monaghan, which has centred on the Garage Theatre, is in serious need of an upgrade by means of a new theatre?  The Garage Theatre has seen much use in the past 12 months, producing 106 shows, or over two shows per week.  That is a notable achievement in a town like Monaghan.  Does the Minister agree the theatre project is deserving of funding, particularly with regard to the excellent record it has had over the previous 14 years?Does the Minister agree the provision of a new theatre in Monaghan would be a major asset to the town and the county in general?  It would attract quite a number of people in the development of the arts and culture-based tourism.  We attract a number of people from the Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh area, and I am sure the Minister would agree there is a good buzz about cross-Border projects etc.  This new theatre would be ideally located in Monaghan.

Under the new ACCESS scheme, 70% of funds will be directed to the enhancement or refurbishment of existing facilities, with 30% available for new facilities.  We received 155 applications from right across the country up to the closing date.  An independent selection committee has been assessing the applications and I do not anticipate an announcement prior to the end of this month.An application was received from the Garage Theatre in Monaghan to build a new theatre in the town.  The project has an estimated cost somewhere in the order of €10 million, with the project promoters seeking funding in the order of €6 million.  There is a difficulty with that in the context of the amount of funding available under the scheme for new build and the amount of funding available generally.As I have stated, the matter is under consideration and an announcement in respect of theatres, as well as art and exhibition centres across the country, can be expected in due course.

The reality is I have a certain fund which I have negotiated to the best of my ability and it must be administered to the best of my ability with regard to promoting arts in the country, taking into account geographical demands.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I welcome the advent of the open skies agreement, which has long been an objective of Irish tourism policy.  Following on the open skies deal, Aer Lingus has announced new services to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles.  These additional routes have the potential to benefit Irish tourism and business links across the country.  The new open skies regime will, of course, see the phasing out of the Shannon stopover policy.  This is a challenge for Shannon but it is also an opportunity.  If Shannon is to successfully rise to that challenge, a number of issues will need to be addressed.The cost base of the airport is too high and if it is not tackled, Shannon will not be able to meet the challenge or exploit the opportunities presented by open skies.  In that context, it is encouraging to note recent positive developments on a severance and flexibility package for staff.The airport will need to look beyond the north Atlantic and look at the opportunities presented by routes to Britain and mainland Europe, building on recent positive experience in that regard.  It is critical that visitors to the Shannon catchment area are provided with accessible routes and transport options.  From a tourism perspective, it is essential that local interests work to enhance the range and quality of tourism product in the region, having regard to Fáilte Ireland's new product development strategies.Tourism marketing will have optimum impact when the above elements are in place.  A key aim of any tourism marketing campaign would be an integrated regional response with a particular focus on maintaining good flows of off-peak business.  There have been demands for a special tourism marketing fund for Shannon but these must be tempered by realism.  The House should note that the total tourism marketing fund for 2007 is €45 million and that Tourism Ireland would have spent less than €8 million in direct marketing in the USA during 2006 for the whole island.My Department has considered the impact of open skies and has been in touch with the tourism agencies which are committed to working closely with Shannon development and the industry in delivering a response, and the Deputy can take it that there will be a response.Any tourism marketing response must, in my view, be delivered by Tourism Ireland, focus on the wider Shannon catchment area, have regard to the new super regions marketing framework introduced in 2006 and, in so far as North America is concerned, conform to Tourism Ireland's new North American strategy.I understand that my colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, will be bringing his draft economic and tourism development plan for Shannon to Cabinet very soon.  That will provide an opportunity for Cabinet to discuss the nature of any response and the need for additional resources, if any.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I am sure the Minister agrees that Shannon Airport is critical to the future of both the Shannon region and the western seaboard.  The Minister is aware that 70% of all transatlantic traffic drops off in Shannon.  It is estimated by the Shannon marketing group that Shannon will lose at least 100,000 transatlantic tourists per year and I do not have to remind the Minister that at least 68% of all tourists disembarking from Shannon end up in County Kerry.  The issue has major implications for that county as well.Some 50% of US companies and investment is located in the Shannon region and the Shannon free zone has one of the biggest industrial parks in the country.  One of the reasons US companies located in and around Shannon was the airport.  There is a distinct possibility that we could lose this type of investment, which would be another major blow to the region.  We could lose tourists and jobs.The Minister is aware of the case of Prestwick Airport in Scotland.  It was a refuelling stop, but due to improvements in airline technology, that stop became unnecessary.  The airport is under significant pressure to survive and I hope the same does not occur at Shannon Airport.Between 1999 and 2003, tourism lost approximately 3 million bed-nights along the western seaboard.  As the Minister knows, there have been a number of closures.  Unless more visitors go the area, there will be further closures.  The Minister mentioned a few plans.  The three reports in the past three years on Shannon Airport with which I am familiar suggested that if the bilateral agreement came about, a plan should be put in place immediately so that Tourism Ireland or another body could enter the source market to ensure business is found for the airport.  On the same day Aer Lingus announced its commitment to retain its 400,000 seats, it announced three new American destinations — Orlando, Detroit and Washington — from Dublin.This is an important issue.  The Minister does not agree with the Irish Hotels Federation that a major marketing plan must be put in place, but I will warn him that this matter will have significant implications for our county, the western seaboard and the Shannon region.  Will he be more specific concerning what strategy is in place to ensure the survival of Shannon Airport?

It was an extraordinary performance and is indicative of the resilience of the tourism industry.  I anticipate that we will exceed those figures this year, surpassing the 8 million visitor mark for the first time.This is a small island on Europe's periphery and visitors arriving in such numbers will benefit every part of it.  Last year, there was a substantial increase on the previous year in the number of visitors to the western seaboard.  I forecast another substantial increase this year.  It is not true to say last year was a poor tourism season.

The number of visitors from the United States of America will increase considerably in the coming years.When we speak of open skies and the Shannon stopover, let it be remembered that there was quid pro quo, namely, our national airline could not fly from more than four gateway cities in the USA.  It was restricted in terms of its growth and, therefore, the number of people it could bring here from the USA.  That quid pro quo is gone, indicative of which is Aer Lingus’s announcement on the night of the agreement being made that it will fly from three more gateway cities.

This will mean that we can anticipate a large increase in the number of American visitors.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has an implementation document regarding the future of Shannon Airport.  I have examined the document and stated that the demand for €44 million is unrealistic.  However, my Department is considering our marketing of the region.  It must be remembered that the number of visitors passing through Shannon Airport last year increased by 23% on the previous year.  Given the pessimism expressed in some quarters, this was a tremendous performance.  Inasmuch as the number of American visitors will increase under open skies, Shannon Airport will also grow.  If it grasps the opportunities outlined in my original reply, I do not doubt that it will continue to benefit the mid west, west, south west and north west as it has always done, albeit in an enhanced way.

The overall policy framework governing the work of the Department is set out in our statement of strategy 2005-07 and regular annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library or on the Department's website.The terms, guidelines and procedures governing individual schemes and programmes operated directly by the Department, such as the sports capital programme, the local authority swimming pool programme and the arts and culture capital enhancement scheme, are posted on the Department's website or are available on request, while details of initiatives operated by the State bodies are available from the bodies themselves.  Some of the beneficiaries of the programmes and initiatives referred to engage in commercial promotions as part of their operations, while others are purely voluntary or not-for-profit organisations.In general, I welcome commercial support and sponsorship for the arts and sport, as such support complements State support and facilitates enhanced facilities, for example, additional or improved exhibitions or assistance for the developmental activities of the governing bodies of sport or individual athletes.The Irish Sports Council's code of ethics and good practice for children's sport encourages sports leaders to refrain from seeking sponsorship from the alcohol and tobacco industries.  Adherence to the code is overseen by the Irish Sports Council.  Given the general nature of the Deputy's question, it is not clear as to what precise information he is seeking, but if he wishes to clarify the matter in a separate question or questions, I would be happy to provide an appropriate reply.

Does the Minister not know that children are being exploited with the approval of an agency under his remit?  He knows of issues I have raised with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, regarding the morality and sensibility of allowing commercial businesses to peddle their wares in schools, but the Minister's Department has taken it one step further.I refer to the Irish Sports Council's involvement in the Kids in Action scheme with Supervalu, the logo of which is in the scheme's advertisements.  I welcome that since 2004, Supervalu has supported Buntús, a non-commercial scheme, but Kids in Action is different.  It is an incentive scheme involving children collecting bundles of €10 vouchers to get equipment.  For example, their purchases must amount to almost €4,000 for a Gaelic football worth less than €20, a basketball coaching bag requires €70,000 worth of purchasing and a so-called free indoor hurley needs €3,800 worth of shopping.  Unfortunately, this blatant commercialism and cynical use of children and teachers is legal and made more attractive by the lack of real investment in schools' physical education equipment.Does the Minister agree with the sports council endorsing a commercial scheme overtly?  Is it not a morally bankrupt and corrupt practice and what will the Minister do about it?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The Sports Council is neither morally bankrupt nor corrupt.  The council is involved in so far as it can be in increasing children's participation in sport.  It operates Buntús, which is assisted by the commercial sector, as the Deputy pointed out.  I do not know the modalities or methodologies of the situation, but the Buntús programme has been successful.We are trying to increase the number of children participating in sport because society has a problem in terms of obesity and its health-related difficulties.  While we use as much of our funding as we can, we are involved with the commercial sector where feasible through the sports council to achieve higher participation rates.  Not for a moment do I believe the council would become involved in any corrupt or immoral practice.

Is he trying to keep kids healthy by allowing a body under his remit to prostitute itself in providing equipment for them?  That is what is happening.  The reality is that the Irish Sports Council is endorsing Super Valu, a commercial company with commercial interests, by allowing its logo to be used in Super Valu's advertisements.  Is that an immoral practice, if not a corrupt one?  Is it right that a body under the remit of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is endorsing a company?  Is the Minister saying he endorses Super Valu because it gives a person a GAA ball worth €18 if he or she spends €4,000 in its shops?

It contained representatives of various Departments and State agencies and was chaired by the then Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Despite some early progress and enthusiasm, the council had a mixed experience.  As its operation was not particularly satisfactory, it eventually petered out.  I understand the establishment of a similar body was considered but not recommended by the tourism policy review group in 2003.While I fully appreciate the concerns which underpin the Deputy's question, many of the issues that impact on tourism do not come under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism alone.  If the potential of the tourism industry is to be fully realised, key policies and decisions should reflect the needs of the sector.  This was recognised as a critical issue by the tourism policy review group.  Rather than recommending the establishment of a tourism strategy committee, the review group decided to focus on the development of an intensive bilateral engagement with key Departments and State agencies on priority issues.Following publication of the review group's report in September 2003, I established a group to monitor implementation of the tourism action plan.  While the implementation group contained considerable tourism expertise, it was not a cross-departmental group.  During the two years of its existence, the group and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism engaged directly with a number of other Departments and State agencies on key issues which affected the tourism development agenda.  The meetings of the implementation group which focused on specific issues or themes were attended by representatives of relevant Departments and State agencies, usually at the level of Secretary General or chief executive officer.This model which has worked well is supported by the tourism sector which is actively engaged in the process.  The implementation group reported that it was satisfied with the degree of progress in implementing the bulk of the recommendations contained in the action plan of the New Horizons report.  In May 2006 I appointed a successor group, the tourism strategy implementation group, to advise on implementation of the outstanding recommendations of the New Horizons report.  This new implementation group is continuing to meet.  It will host a tourism forum in April, to which representatives of the tourism sector will be invited.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I asked this question because it was obvious that several Departments had some connection with and involvement in the development of the tourism industry.  It often seems that certain Departments do not know what others are doing.  I will give the Minister some examples of what I am talking about.  When I was travelling on one of the new super trains recently, I was told that bicycles could not be transported on them.  The efforts of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to promote cycling as a holiday activity are being stymied by the introduction by the Department of Transport, through CIE, of new trains which cannot carry bicycles.  I was in attendance when the Minister recently launched a new walks committee under the aegis of the Irish Sports Council.  It seems the committee will operate independently of the walks development unit of Tourism Ireland.  The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for the development of the tourism product in coastal areas but it does not seem to engage in great contact with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in that regard.Decisions being taken in the Departments I have mentioned, as well as the Departments of Finance; Education and Science; and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, impinge on the tourism product and affect the future of the tourism industry.  It is obvious that there is little communication between the various Departments and the lead Department in this regard — the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Other countries have established bodies to co-ordinate their responses to various issues in this area.  The tourism industry will increase in importance as the agriculture and fishing industries continue to decline in many rural areas.  Tourism is our main hope.  A number of reports I have seen have recommended a greater focus on joined-up thinking and cross-departmental co-operation, but it is obvious that such progress is not happening.  I strongly recommend that we take such an approach.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	344	When I became Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I decided to establish the tourism policy review group to examine the tourism industry and ascertain how a greater degree of interaction between the relevant Departments and State agencies could be facilitated.  The review group which operated successfully under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers produced a report that contained over 70 recommendations.  When I received that report, I established an implementation review group to monitor implementation of the review group's recommendations.  The implementation review group has successfully engaged with Departments and agencies on their implementation.  It has worked successfully with the Secretaries General of various Departments and the chief executives of various State agencies.  I recently established a follow-on group to ensure the action plan was implemented.  This group is monitoring implementation of the rest of the proposals from the review group's report.I am satisfied that the sector benefits from a far greater degree of co-operation and co-operation than used to be the case.  The current leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, established the Tourism Council when he was Minister for Tourism and Trade.  I am sure he would agree that the council did not work, unfortunately, and eventually petered out.

When I attended a meeting of anglers in Athy yesterday, those present expressed major concern that many of the English angling clubs which used to come to their part of the country each year were no longer doing so because there was a scarcity of fish in the rivers in the south Kildare area.  The two representatives of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board who attended the meeting said the board was not getting enough funding from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to provide the necessary protection, etc.  A major tourist attraction in my local area is suffering because the Department is not committed to its development.  It is obvious that tourists are suffering as a result.  I mention this case to highlight the need for interdepartmental resolve to ensure every aspect of the tourism industry is supported.  I ask the Minister to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, about the many problems being faced by those involved in the coarse fishing sector, in particular.  Many international magazines are reporting that Ireland is not as attractive an angling destination, especially for those interested in coarse fishing, as it used to be.  Such factors are having a detrimental effect on the progress being made with this part of the tourism industry.

A number of initiatives have been undertaken in recent times with a view to increasing participation in angling tourism.  I accept that there has been a reduction in the number of anglers coming to this country from overseas.  A substantial number of such tourists used to come in the late 1990s, but that number halved in the following six or seven years.  The Government has taken steps in recent times to examine whether that trend can be reversed. The House is aware of the measures upon which we have embarked.  We will see an increase in the number of angling tourists in the future.  The central and regional fisheries boards are aware of the need to replenish the rivers.

This comprises €119 million to fund phase 1 of the campus project and €30 million, committed at this stage, towards the development of further facilities in the next phase of development.The facilities to be provided in phase 1 of the development will meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons, who compete at national and international levels and will also provide for the needs of the local community.  Preliminary planning for this phase has commenced and the National Sports Campus Development Authority is currently preparing a tender to appoint a design and project management team for the project.  It is too early in the development stage of the project for projected statistics of use of the facilities but the national governing bodies have confirmed their willingness to use the facility extensively when it is developed.The facilities provided in phase 1 of the project will include a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre that will provide world class training facilities for over 30 governing bodies of sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science and medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.The Government decision for this stage of development included agreement to move the headquarters of the FAI to the former State laboratory building at Abbotstown.  Planning permission for a change of use of the State laboratory was secured and work on the building is about to get under way.  Subject to suitable terms on the lease being finalised, it is expected the FAI will relocate there during this year.  It is also intended to provide a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport by refurbishing an existing building on the site and the institute should be based there later this year.A planning study for the Abbotstown site has recently been completed by an inter-agency group, including my Department, which was undertaken under the provisions of the Fingal county development plan.  This study sets out the mix of sporting, leisure, and amenity facilities that would be appropriate for the site.  The planning study was presented to Fingal County Council and was considered at a council meeting on 12 March.  A proposal to change the zoning of a large portion of the site to open space to allow for sports use and for the woodland area of the site to be zoned high amenity will be considered by the council before the summer.In January, under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006, I established the National Sports Campus Development Authority on a statutory basis to succeed in function and responsibility Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company Ltd, CSID.  To coincide with the new authority, I appointed a board comprising a judicious mix of the board members of the former company CSID and some new faces who will bring expertise to the tasks facing the new authority, under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan Flinter.  In addition to overseeing the development of phase 1 of the campus, I have requested that the new board would identify and prioritise the next phase of the development of the Abbotstown project.The National Aquatic Centre, NAC, which was the first facility on the site, was restored to the direct control of what is now the National Sports Campus Development Authority in November 2006.  This brought closure of an unhappy chapter for that facility.  The operation of the NAC is now managed by a subsidiary company of the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  I am pleased to say the business of the centre is operating satisfactorily — the facility is now in good condition and a full check on the total facility is being carried out with a view to putting the centre on a footing which is appropriate to the standard of service it is capable of delivering.  The Abbotstown facilities, when completed, will provide a much needed range of training and competitive facilities for our sportspersons who continue to represent our country with passion, pride and success.

Will the Minister confirm that extensive repairs have been carried out in recent times and that the building company, Ascon Rohcon, has been on site for some weeks, confirming that there were large defects in the original building?  This side of the House maintained the fine building should be repaired because it was built speedily.  What was the extent of the repairs?  Has the snag list been resolved?  Since the subsidiary of National Sports Campus Development Authority took over the centre it is reportedly losing a considerable amount of money in running costs.

The NAC was taken over by CSID, which is now the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  There was a snag list and, as with all construction projects, there is a process for dealing with any snags that arise.  Dublin Waterworld Ltd refused to facilitate access to the centre while a dispute about the lease was in progress.  The final snag list is not yet satisfactorily resolved.  Some €23,000 has been retained and will not be paid until the snag list has been completed.  Getting these matters resolved is a long, drawn out process in projects of this magnitude.  Work will resume and remaining issues will be resolved without delay.  If there are any structural defects this is a matter for Rohcon.

What will be the cost of this?  Will premises be leased for an annual fee?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	360	It is not intended that the headquarters of each body be located at Abbotstown in the near future.  The FAI headquarters will move there immediately and the Institute of Sport will be there by the end of the year.  Other national governing bodies of sport will move headquarters to Abbotstown.  The training centre provided under phase 1 will provide world class training facilities for over 30 governing bodies of sport.  It will not be an accommodation centre but a training centre for minority sports.  For example, there will be a basketball court for Basketball Ireland.  This will enable elite athletes from the governing bodies of sport to reach their full potential.  Back-up will be provided by the Institute of Sport, providing medical, nutritional and physiological advice.  The intention is to ensure our athletes have the same back-up as those in other countries.  The vision is that this commences the construction of a necklace with pearls of varying sizes being added at varying intervals by various Governments until the necklace is complete.

Legislation will be needed to underpin the establishment.  Will there be time to rush through legislation?  Will the Minister refer briefly to the relationship between the new institute and Coaching Ireland in Limerick?  The experts will be in the institute, while the coaches will be developed in Limerick.  Has the Minister determined what the relationship will be between the two bodies?  The Institute of Sport will obviously include science and medical personnel, while the coaching staff in Limerick will, no doubt, include all the top coaches.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Since time and tide wait for no man, I do not anticipate that we will be in a position to push through the legislation for the Institute of Sport this session.  I anticipate, however, that the legislation will be introduced some time this year in order to put the institute on a statutory footing.  Clearly, it will be a matter for the Minister, whoever he or she will be, to decide what direction the institute should take.  I have views of my own to which he or she may have access if I am not in office.On the relationship of the Institute of Sport with the University of Limerick, it is the intention that the institute will have a great deal of contact with a number of universities, the University of Limerick, in particular, which has been enormously successful.  The National Coaching Centre hosted more than 20 athletes who went on to win Olympic medals.  That is indicative of the standard of facilities and personnel located at the centre.  However, the Institute of Sport will have its headquarts at Abbotstown.  While the arrangements between the headquarters and constituent parts of the organisation have yet to be fully ironed out, suffice it to say the University of Limerick will play an active part in the development of facilities for the institute and related matters.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The World Tourism Organisation, WTO, was established in 1975 to replace the International Union of Official Travel Organisations, whose membership comprised the national tourism organisations of more that 80 countries, including Ireland.  The WTO became a specialised agency of the United Nations in 2003.  Ireland has never been a member of the WTO.  I note that a number of other EU countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland and Sweden are not included in the current list of members.  I understand the USA is also not a member.For most tourism administrations, the most useful aspect of WTO activity has been its role in compiling international tourism statistics.  Fáilte Ireland has long co-operated with the WTO in this area and, as a result of supplying statistics to the organisation, receives full access to WTO statistical information.The question of Irish membership of the WTO has been considered on a number of occasions since 1975.  The consistent opinion has been that the potential benefits to Irish tourism are limited and would not justify the costs involved.  Both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland have access to WTO reports and indicated that Irish membership would not result in any improvement in information access.  Neither do they view funding for membership of the WTO as a priority.  When the question of membership was considered in 2003, it was estimated that the annual cost of Irish membership would be over €140,000 and it is likely to be even higher for future years.  It is not clear if additional calls for funding support will arise.Since the WTO was established in 1975, the scale and performance of the Irish tourism industry has changed beyond measure and I doubt that membership of the WTO would have added significantly to that performance.  The Deputy will be aware of the record performance in 2006 when over 7.7 million overseas visitors came to the country, generating almost €4.7 billion in associated revenue.  While I was pleased to secure a record level of Exchequer funding for the tourism services budget in 2007, it is also my responsibility to ensure money is used for the most efficient and productive reasons.  Accordingly, while there is a cost to WTO membership, there are limited tangible benefits.  I do not propose, therefore, to change Ireland's long-standing policy of non-membership at this stage.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The sum of €140,000 would seem a small price to pay for sitting around the table with some of the leading players in world tourism, including some of our main competitors.  Tourism will become an even greater driver of economic activity with the decline of other native industries such as agriculture and fisheries.  As a wealthy country that is doing well, Ireland surely must play its role in international tourism innovation and research.  We have much to give, but also much to learn.  It is not doing our status as a driver of world tourism activity any good not being involved with this organisation, the recognised body for world tourism.  There are benefits to be gained.  Possibly the WTO might hold its annual conference in Ireland, in which case the Minister would recoup whatever investments were made.  He would make important contacts with other countries which would be of benefit to business tourism interests which his Department are pushing at this time.  The WTO is an official UN agency and can facilitate close working relationships with other countries.Every day in Ireland we speak of product innovation but our own product has gone stale and is tired.  We know what is happening in other countries.  I know it may be read over the Internet, but it is only when one comes face to face with experts from other countries that one learns about what is happening in world tourism.  The Minister has not read this issue correctly.  The next Minister will have  to look seriously at it.  I ask the Minister to have the Secretary General of his Department, Mr.  Haugh, to take a serious look at it, to review the benefits in view of the developments that have occurred within the organisation in recent years and the fact that it is driving the tourism sector across the world, Third World countries included.  There are Third World countries which are members of the WTO.  As we have an obligation towards least developed states, surely this would be a very important forum to which be a member, if only to provide assistance for them, given our successful experience in attracting tourists.

As a result of supplying statistics to the organisation, it has full access to WTO statistical material.  Tourism Ireland also enjoys full access to WTO reports and analysis for little or no charge.  I see little point, therefore, in eking out €140,000 of taxpayer's money to join an organisation from which there will be no additional benefit.

The incoming Minister might have a different view on the matter, which is fine with me.  However, it is my opinion that it is not worthwhile joining the WTO.  It would have been fine to join to see whether it would be possible to attract additional tourism business but the reality is that tourism is one of the most competitive businesses in the world.  Far from helping one another, members of the WTO are in hard competition with one another.  Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, it is a tough world and we are in competition with all WTO members.

The arts and education committee members are Mary Nunan, Arts Council member, Jerome Morrissey, National Centre for Training in Technology, Pat MacSitric, assistant chief inspector, Department of Education and Science, Mr. Derek West, chair of National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Orlaith McBride, Arts Council member.  The committee is due to report with its recommendations, in May, after which consideration can be given to their implementation and any possible funding requirements.In its deliberations, the committee will have regard to the wide-ranging demands on the school curriculum bearing in mind that responsibility for determining its content rests with the Minister for Education and Science.  It will have regard to the need to prioritise and cost its recommendations; that these recommendations must have regard both to their resource implications for the Arts Council and the budgetary resources available over the next four years to the Minister for Education and Science for the development of services in the education sector which must be allocated to fund existing policy commitments.  Subject to these factors, it will consider the identification of what additional sources of funding, if any, might be available to fund its recommendations and the roles and partnerships appropriate for relevant State and other agencies and bodies in this context, including the Department of Education and Science, the Arts Council, vocational committees and local authorities.  The focus of the special committee's advice should be on making specific and deliverable recommendations for implementation over three to five years.Giving the arts a higher, more consistent profile at both primary and post-primary levels, can bring significant benefits to students.  It is important to stress this applies to all students and not just to those who are recognised as being particularly gifted artistically.  As the future of the arts resides with our children, it is vital the arts are embedded in our education system at all levels.  I look forward to seeing the results of the committee's work and am committed to encouraging participation in the arts as part of our children's education.Any question of funding to implement the recommendations of the committee will be addressed in the context of the 2008 Estimates process.  During my tenure, I have been singular in my objective to enhance the resourcing of the arts and culture sector.  I have taken the sector from the periphery of the policy circle to its very core.  For 2007, I secured more than €216 million for the arts and culture sector.  The national development plan has allocated more than €900 million for capital projects in the area.  Unquestionably, neither I nor this Government has been found deficient in funding the arts and culture sector.

Will he meet regularly with the Arts Council?  With Deputy Boyle, I have met Arts Council representatives regularly and their one constant comment is that the council does not have the moneys to secure performing arts and other art forms to attend schools and enhance the primary and secondary schools curriculum.The Green Party has announced that if in government, it will provide an additional €10 million from education funding to the Arts Council.  Is the Minister prepared to push for this through his Department or in consultations with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin?  The arts play an important role in society in assisting in developing students' creativity which can lead to better, more rounded individuals who will ultimately benefit the economy.

Subsequently, the committee's report set out a policy framework.  It was accepted there was no coherent policy for the traditional arts and they were under-resourced.  As a result of the policy document being accepted by the Arts Council, we succeeded in funding the traditional arts.  Ever since, they have been flowering.Following on from this, I established the education and arts committee under Mary Nunan.  It is continuing its deliberations with a view to producing a policy document which will be presented some time in May.  In the autumn during the Estimates process I hope that under the tenure of whoever is the Minister responsible, the arts and education policy document will be implemented with the same fervour, enthusiasm and enlightenment as the traditional arts policy was.

It has always been my policy not to interfere in this matter.  I pay tribute to the GAA for agreeing to accommodate international rugby and soccer matches in Croke Park in 2007.  I commend the association on its decision of 17 February last, which will allow for the use of Croke Park for rugby and soccer internationals in 2008.  The Lansdowne Road stadium will not be completed until 2009 and may not be available for games until 2010.  I would hope the GAA would be in a position to accommodate the FAI and the IRFU in 2009.  This would benefit all sporting fans in ensuring that important international fixtures are accommodated on Irish soil.In January 2004, the Government agreed to provide funding of €191 million to the joint IRFU-FAI project for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road stadium as a 50,000-capacity all-seater stadium.  The recent decision taken by An Bord Pleanála has now cleared the wayfor the redevelopment to commence.  The Lansdowne Road facility will be out of commission for a period.  A welcome agreement has been reached between the GAA, IRFU and the FAI with regard to international rugby and soccer fixtures in 2007 and 2008.  Whether a similar agreement can be reached in 2009 is a matter for the three organisations involved.The staging of the Six Nations rugby internationals against France and England at Croke Park was a resounding success.  Furthermore, Ireland's European Championship qualifier against Wales on Saturday, before a crowd of more than 70,000 spectators and watched by many more at home, was another historic occasion.  I am particularly pleased these matches have given international exposure to the GAA and Croke Park.  No longer is the facility Ireland's best kept secret but rather a stadium which is the envy of the world.  I look forward to further great entertainment when the remaining international rugby and the soccer fixtures take place there over the next two years.  Tonight, I hope we will be celebrating at the expense of our friends from Slovakia.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Deputy Allen said we ought to stop praising the European Union and respond to public concerns over jobs and enlargement.  I do not agree with him.  Fifty years of European achievement is well worth celebrating, as happened in Berlin last weekend.  The EU has transformed Europe into a peaceful and prosperous place.  It has also transformed Ireland.  We need to remind ourselves of these gains and move on to tackle the new challenges that lie ahead.  Deputy Allen blames the EU, particularly enlargement, for certain negative developments.  This is a strange position for a Deputy who is pro-European.  I am convinced the European Union remains the best prospect that we in Ireland have of securing a future in which the undoubted gains we have made since 1973 can be maintained and built upon.As regards enlargement, there is now a natural pause in the process.  No further accessions are planned for some years.  This allows time for all of us to make the best of the 27 member state Union that exists.  Future accessions will take place when a candidate country meets all the conditions for membership.  In all the negotiations we have had since 2004 and since the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, Ireland and its colleagues have made it clear that all candidate countries will have to meet all the conditions for membership.  I do not envisage any large-scale enlargement in the coming decades along the lines that occurred in 2004 when Ireland held the Presidency.Deputy Crowe spoke of his party's fundamental opposition to Ireland's membership of the European Union.  He called this legislation a "nightmare" and spoke of the European superstate.  He used the word "nightmare" in his attack on the Bill and on the European Union generally.  All I can say is that the isolationist path favoured by the Deputy and his colleagues would be a nightmare for this country if we were forced to reverse and to have to stand alone against the ravages of international pressures, global inflation, major financial decisions being taken in international headquarters and capitals throughout the world and had to compete in a market where we were totally dependent on our own resources without any support either structurally or financially from an external organisation like the European Union.  Are they in denial about the vast gains we have made since 1973, many of which are attributable to our EU membership?  Do they want us to return to a time of high unemployment and high levels of emigration when our best and largest export was the brightest people we had, we left this country to build up economies across the world to the detriment of our own?  That would be the likely result of following the anti-EU line advocated by the Deputy and his party.I remind the Deputy and his party colleagues that this Bill is a subject for debate, which is an honest response by the Government to the judgments of the Supreme Court.  We did not ask for this situation but as constitutional parliamentarians we are all obliged to accept the decisions of that court and respond to them.  Members of all parties in this House over the years have recognised the primacy of that court and the implications its decisions has for us as legislators.  I have made that point time and again since 1 December last when this debate commenced in the Seanad.Deputy Crowe used the term "coup d’état” in describing the implications of a Bill to alter the way that this State transposes its EU obligations.  This is an offensive exaggeration.  Some might suggest that these words roll easier off Deputy Crowe’s tongue given his party’s recent acceptance of the democratic principles on which this Dáil and State are founded.  Deputy Crowe’s intervention reveals once against that his party’s politics on the European Union are at least 40 years behind the times.

I am sure that Deputies Costello and Allen would agree with me that whatever our concerns about the direction of certain European policies, we continue to respect fully the democratic decision of the sovereign Irish people taken almost 35 years ago on 10 May 1972 to pledge our future to peace and prosperity in Europe.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The late Jack Lynch spoke on the debate in this Chamber more than 40 years ago when we had made the decision to reactivate Ireland's second application for membership for membership of the European Economic Community.  He opted for EC membership because he understood, as leader of the nation at the time over 40 years ago, that our economic future lay in the Common Market and he saw that Irish people wanted to prolong and share in the ideal of a united Europe that was economically strong and a powerful influence for peace.  How right he was.  He said in this House that the freedom we enjoy has been hard won, other nations have fought hard for their freedom and they treasure it no less than we do.  The countries which have subscribed to the Rome treaty value what they have achieved as separate nations.  They value too what they are creating in common.  Our wish is to share in this great task.Deputy Crowe and his party are slow learners on EU issues and on the pooling of sovereignty that membership involves.  They seem to see the political task facing this country through the lens of narrow nationalism.  The Government and main Opposition parties recognise and are aware that the task we face is a broad one.  Promoting and defending Ireland's interest in the European Union is a real national interest about which there is no doubt.  This Bill is part of our response to our evolving obligations in the European Union.  We will not be found wanting in that national objective by snipping comments about the European Union from the Sinn Féin backbenches.  It is time that members of that party recognised that they, too, as citizens of this country like all other citizens have benefited from the European Union.  What we are doing today is simply putting through legislation that recognises the responsibilities we have as a result of the two Supreme Court judgments and vis-à-vis the European Union and that links the initial legislation of 1972 with our evolving requirements through legislative processes both primary and secondary since 1972 to today.  We are refining our legislation to take account of the strength of the Union and of Ireland and our strong responsibilities to ensure that our laws concur and are symbiotic and parallel with the directives of the European Union to ensure that we can fulfil our legislative operations and requirements as a sovereign state within a proud and successful European Union.

What we are denying are the benefits of further integration, further loss of sovereignty and a further reduction in our independence.  We welcomed and encouraged further enlargement and we have gone further than the Minister of State in encouraging that all new member states accede to the Union on an equal footing with existing member states.  Earlier this year the Government refused that to Romania and Bulgaria.Turning to the Bill before us, I asked the Minister a number of questions on Committee Stage about the effect of this Bill when enacted and what legislation it will cover.  What are we retrospectively trying to endorse by this legislation?  That is the nature of this Bill.  The Supreme Court asked us to do this otherwise those legislative measures would have been found unconstitutional.  I accept this must be done.  I have not denied that but it should be done by the House on an individual basis in terms of the legislation concerned or at least in the full knowledge of the legislation that will be covered by the enactment of this Bill.We do not have full knowledge of that.  The scraps of three sheets of paper that make up this Bill do not properly explain the full extent of what we are dealing with today.  I asked the Minister to insert in the Bill a schedule of the laws and statutory instruments to be retrospectively endorsed, but that was not produced.  As the Minister has not proceeded that way and refused on Committee Stage to produce such a schedule, my amendment proposes to delete this and other sections of the Bill.  Without the inclusion of such a schedule the wool is being pulled over the eyes of Members of this House but also, as my colleague suggested, this Bill is a coup d’état to a degree.What we are doing is handing the Minister of State and future Ministers additional powers but we are handing the Minister of State in particular the power to retrospectively endorse a swathe of statutory instruments and legislation.  For any person to have that type of power amounts to a coup d’état.  At the very least and out of respect to this House a list detailing the full implications of this legislation should have been produced.  The explanatory memorandum does not contain a such list.  We do not know the number of legislative measures being dealt with in this regard.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I will deal with the matter in two minutes.  I expected us to have an adult and mature debate on the issues.  I tried to be as constructive as possible in my earlier contribution but the Minister of State misrepresented my position.  He spoke about being a little boy in short pants but he is behaving like one now in attempting to misrepresent my views and those of my party.  I said in my earlier contribution that my party and I are strongly pro-Europe but that the actions of the Minister of State and of the Government in trying to bypass this House by introducing European directives and legislation by means of statutory instrument undermines this House and Irish law.  We set out procedures which could be followed to safeguard the integrity of the House, but he is not prepared to deal with those positive proposals from this side of the House.I said that I feared for the European Constitution and the referendum that may be held within the next two years.  I fear for its passing because I believe the Minister of State's actions and those of the Government as well as what has been happening in this country in recent times raise grave doubts in people's minds.  I referred earlier to the drift of jobs from west to east, the new member states and people's fears about the ongoing rush towards enlargement.  I stated there would need to be time out, as they say in basketball, to reassess the ability of the European structures to accommodate the accessions that took place since 2004.We should not lecture people by telling them that Europe is good for them but rather we should listen to the people's opinions and fears and try to address them.  One issue of concern is the undercutting of salary and wage rates by people coming from the new member states.  That is not the fault of the people coming into this country but rather of Fianna-Fáil led Governments for failing to have a decent inspectorate to deal with undercutting and the non-compliance with the minimum wage in many cases, of which the Minister of State and I are aware.  All these issues raise concerns which will make things difficult.  To top it all, the Minister of State is bypassing the Dáil with this type of legislation.  There is a way around it which will keep the Opposition happy and alleviate people's fears.  The Minister of State's response is to misrepresent our position and that is wrong.  We asked for a full and frank discussion, but the debate must end at 4.45 p.m., which is not a full and frank discussion.  We will be opposing this Bill.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	400	The Minister of State was busy during the sos putting together that tome he has just delivered to the House.  None of us on this side of the House said one bad word against the European Union.  We are in favour of the European Union, which we strongly support.  It ill-behoves the Minister of State to try to paint us as opponents of the European Union.Our concern is that, because we support the European Union, we want to ensure that we get this legislation right so that others who do not support the European Union cannot use the legislation to undermine our position and the good work of the European Union.  If proper channels of accountability are to be bypassed by means of this legislation, we are not doing a good day's work.  This is our concern and we pointed out what we consider to be the unacceptable aspects of the legislation.  It confers on the Minister a power which up to this has never been conferred on any Minister in the history of this House.  It allows a Minister to alter and amend a directive or legislation and present it to the House as a final product which must be obeyed under severe penalty by every citizen of the State.  The penalties are not summary but indictable penalties.  This has never happened before and it would be a bad day's work if this House were to rubber-stamp it.The Opposition wants to ensure that the European Union has a future and will not be undermined by Eurosceptics because we have left the gate open here.  Deputy Allen is Chairman of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  This legislation should be properly processed through this House so that citizens recognise we are not undermining the House by means of European legislation.

Before the sos I outlined my concerns about the Bill, but the Minister of State or whoever wrote the speech for him seems to have come up with a different version of events.  I expressed concerns about the direction in which this Bill is going and that we were being asked to agree to a blank page regarding future legislation.I know that the Minister of State is accustomed to gilding the lily and he ended up before a tribunal about gilding the lily on a radio station.  He has gilded the lily again today and I ask him to retract his statement.  Neither I nor my party are anti-European, we are pro-European.  I am not anti-democratic but I believe this Bill is.  The Minister of State's remarks are regrettable in the manner in which he described our organisation and our party.  We were trying to outline our concerns about this Bill in a sane and logical manner.  These concerns are shared by many in this country and by many in this Chamber, in particular on this side of the House.The Minister of State is trying to back us into a corner and implying we are trying to do something that we are not trying to do.  I ask him to reflect on my remarks made before the sos as they will be written in the Official Report of Dáil proceedings.  I outlined the undemocratic nature of this Bill, which is bringing us in a direction that is of concern.  I ask the Minister of State to read my exact words on this issue.

I always listen to contributions and I take notice of what is said.  The best advice I could give to Deputy Crowe is to refer him to a Latin maxim, verba volant, littera scripta manet, meaning, words fly, the written word remains.  I ask him to read the record of the House and balance what he said against what I said in response and we can discuss it on another day.  I have been positively appraising, to the best of my ability, all the remarks made.  I made it clear that the two main Opposition parties, with the Government, are completely pro-Europe——

A number of Members referred to sweeping powers being granted under this legislation.  I wish to make two points.  First, such powers will be limited to Ministers and, second, they can only be used, where necessary, to give effect to our European Union obligations.  We are not creating a carte blanche situation.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The first point I wish to make is that the Bill will be guillotined.  The Supreme Court made the two landmark decisions to which the Minister referred, in 2003 and 2005, but it was not until June of last year that the Government decided to examine the matter and, as a result, the legislation must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  If it is so urgent, why have we been obliged to wait four years for action to be taken?  Why, in the dying days of this Government's term of office, is a guillotine being applied in respect of a matter that is so important in the context of democracy and the European Union?I must point out to the Minister of State that all power is being transferred to the Minister.  He stated that such power will only be used where necessary.  However, section 4(2) states:A statutory instrument made for a purpose referred to in subsection (1) may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister of the Government making the statutory instrument to be necessary for the purposes of the statutory instrument (including provisions repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification, other law, exclusive of this Act, the Act of 1972 and the provision of the statute under which the statutory instrument is made).The provision does not refer to such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister, the Government and his or her advisers to be necessary.  It refers, however, to "repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification, other law".  It is, therefore, as all-encompassing an item of legislation as I have ever seen introduced in the House.  The Minister will be able to do what is outlined in section 4(2) without reference to the procedures used to introduce and process legislation in the House.  If the Minister of State tries to say that it does not do so, he should, as he quoted earlier in Latin, allow the legislation to speak for itself.I am opposed to the Bill because I believe we should not do our business in this fashion.  I am also opposed to it because it sends out a message to the Eurosceptics and everyone who has a bone to pick with the European Union that this House is transferring power to a Minister of the Government to legislate on behalf of Europe for this country and its citizens.  The Minister of State indicated that the Minister is elected by the people, but that is not the case.  The representatives in this House are elected, while Ministers are appointed.  Members are elected to legislate but Ministers are not elected to legislate, they are appointed to be part of the process of legislating.  The Bill before us will make the Minister the legislator and will give him full authority to usurp the functions of the Dáil and the Upper House.  That is why we have raised these fundamental issues of democracy.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, are out of order.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy Costello.  Amendment No. 9 is related.  Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 will be taken together.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 4, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:""(5) Regulations under this section which create an indictable offence shall cease to have effect after 3 months unless confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas which sets out in substantive form the terms of the offence.".".This amendment is being brought forward because the Minister is abrogating to himself enormous powers which no other Minister has ever had.  He will allow himself and the Government the power to introduce laws by way of statutory instruments, the penalty for breaches of which will be up to three years in prison and a fine of €500,000.  No other Minister in the history of the State ever attempted such a dastardly action.  He should be ashamed of himself for what he is doing today.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	434	He is certainly making a mark.  This side of the House has a problem with the principle of guillotining the debate on a Bill without providing an opportunity to discuss it fully.  The normal procedures of the House which we were elected to follow are being bypassed.  This sends a bad message to those Eurosceptics who wish to attack the European Union.  They will be able to say the Union is totally unaccountable because legislation is being introduced by way of ministerial instrument.  This will not just involve any old directive because the Minister is giving himself the power to amend or appeal legislation from the European Union as he sees fit.  He will be able to do what he likes, while avoiding the House.  Clearly, anybody who wishes to take exception to the European Union will be able to cite this bad day's work of undermining normal procedures in respect of legislation emanating from the European Union.The explanatory memorandum makes no bones about the fact that the Bill amends the European Communities Act 1972 to provide for indictable offences.  My amendment tries to rectify this to some extent by providing that where an indictable offence is created, it should cease to have effect after three months unless confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas which sets out in substantive form the terms of the offence.  We are not great at transposing European directives into domestic law and are particularly far behind on all important environmental directives.  However, if we transpose a directive at short notice or in an emergency with the result that an indictable offence is created, we would at least have the fall-back position of having to reconsider it in the context of substantive legislation after three months.  The minimum the Minister should do is give us a period of reflection where a transposed European directive carries a penalty of up to three years imprisonment or a fine of €500,000.  The Oireachtas could deal with the issues involved in the normal fashion and then get on with its job.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	435	This amendment concerns the supremacy of the Oireachtas and its right to make or retain laws without being bypassed on the whim of a Minister.  The Minister was given a way out on Committee Stage when reasonable proposals were made by Opposition spokespersons.  He had the opportunity to redeem himself and retrieve the situation but he chose to ignore it.I will not try to misrepresent the Minister of State in the way he misrepresented us earlier.  He said on Committee Stage that severe pressure could be put on the Government to introduce a regulation from the Europe Union at short notice.  Lack of action could, for example, result in the country being penalised.  For that reason, he was unable to accept one of our amendments.  However, the record is pathetic with regard to transposition of EU regulations into domestic law.  Replies to questions I asked last week indicate that a wide range of Departments have failed utterly to deal with many of the directives coming from the European Union.  I do not wish to be unfair to Departments as I do not have the figures to hand, but 50 to 60 directives pertaining to the Department of Transport have only partially been transposed.  In the area of the environment the Government has failed to transpose a range of regulations.  Few Departments are without sin in this matter.  Therefore, the excuse that fear of the heavy hand of the European Union forces the Government to bypass normal democratic procedures and principles is pathetic.In the seven minutes that remain on Report Stage I ask the Minister to State to treat us in a realistic and fair manner.  He should either consider Deputy Costello's amendment or entertain the proposals made on Committee Stage that regulations should not take effect until after they have been laid before the Dáil for a period of 21 days.  Members would then have an opportunity to raise the contents on the floor of the House.

The primary approach should be to confirm in the Oireachtas any legislation retrospectively validated by the Bill.Last week I put a series of questions to Ministers and received varying answers.  My intention was to receive a list of legislation and statutory instruments in order to bring forward an amendment which would set out in a Schedule the laws and statutory instruments affected by the Bill.  Deputy Costello's amendment would ensure regulations would have to be endorsed within three months.  The Ministers for Defence, Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Foreign Affairs, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Arts, Sport and Tourism replied that no such instruments pertained to their Departments.  The latter two qualified this by stating their Departments have only existed in their current form since 2002 and, therefore, other legislation may have been enacted in the past.  The remaining eight Ministers were unable to supply a list of the laws and statutory instruments within the time available.  That period is dictated by the Government, not me, and the Government has guillotined this legislation at every turn.  That is a living disgrace and it is the reason people are suspicious of the EU and this House.  This is the most undemocratic legislation that has been introduced since my election to the House.  It is an insult to those who take the time to elect us on the basis that we pass legislation——

A list of the relevant legislation has not been provided and this debacle has been presented to us in this legislation.  Most Bills, which refer to a range of legislation and statutory instruments, have Schedules attached but that is not the case with this legislation.  It is that undemocratic.  It will stand to us in the Opposition that we tried to ensure the public was aware of what was being done.I do not say we would have opposed all the legislation passed previously or that we disagree with retrospectively endorsing it because a mistake was made but that opportunity is not being provided to us because a number of Departments have been unable to provide us with the necessary information to properly scrutinise the Bill.  The Minister of State and others have stated how important it is for Members to scrutinise European legislation.  We cannot even scrutinise legislation introduced in the House, never mind the European Union, because we have not been supplied with the relevant data.  We do not know what will be the full effect of this legislation.  That is how disgraceful and undemocratic is this legislation.  It is a further disgrace that the debate is being guillotined.  The public will understand our position that at the very least we should have had a proper debate and sufficient time to discuss the full impact of the legislation.

This arrangement would be completely unworkable, as it would be a retrograde step, which would seriously and unnecessarily delay the implementation of European Community law in this State.  It would leave us open to the damaging accusation of failing to live up to our EU obligations.

Failure to pass the required Act of the Oireachtas within the three-month period would cause significant uncertainty for both the Government and the citizens and that would not be fair.  We cannot create a scenario where there is doubt about it.  Deputy Allen referred to the Government's failure to implement European directives but we have a very good record.  We have been very measured and careful in certain areas where the pressures are very complex and to ensure the legislation is refined, a great deal of attention and time is devoted to it.According to the Internal Market for the first quarter of 2007, we are the third best in the Union.

That clause has proved to be completely unworkable, as I stated on Second and Committee Stages.  The wisdom of Parliament subsequent to that was that it was deleted by the Oireachtas shortly after the Act came into force.  The original section 4 arrangement was less practical than Deputy Costello's complex suggestion.  It envisaged a sunset clause of six months and gave the Oireachtas more time to assess and approve secondary legislation.  We should not return to a totally unworkable proposal that was discarded more than three decades ago.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.

On Committee Stage, I indicated I would bring forward an amendment to the Medical Practitioners Bill to take account of the new provisions on protected disclosures which were included in the Health Bill.  The first in this group of two amendments is included as a consequence to my proposed amendment to section 57 to ensure a citation of the Health Acts will include the new provision in section 57(9).The new sections on protected disclosure inserted in the Health Act 2004 include a reference to section 45 of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 which deals with an application for an inquiry on fitness to practice.  As the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 is to be repealed by this Bill, it is technically necessary to make provision for the new replacement provisions under section 57 of the Bill under which a complaint may be made to be referenced in the Health Act as a protected disclosure.  This is purely a technical matter to take account of the repeal of old provisions and their replacement with the new provisions in this Bill.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I examined this and took legal advice.  The strong legal advice received and the advice of the Medical Council was to stick with the case law.  In his decision in O'Laoire v. The Medical Council on 27 January 1995, Mr. Justice Keane stated:conduct which could not properly be characterised as "infamous" or "disgraceful" and which does not involve any degree of moral turpitude, fraud or dishonesty may still constitute "professional misconduct" if it is conduct connected with his profession in which the medical practitioner concerned has seriously fallen short, by omission or commission, of the standards of conduct expected amongst medical practitioners.Mr. Justice Keane also stated only conduct which seriously falls short of the accepted standards of the profession could justify a finding by the professional colleagues of a doctor of professional misconduct on his part.  This is the case law and I am strongly advised by the Attorney General's office and the Medical Council that the Bill is appropriate and only deals with what the judge stated seriously falls short of accepted standards.  Deputy McManus made the same point, that minor issues would not involve a doctor being struck off.

In page 16, line 43, after "including" to insert the following:"the advances, limitations and risks of current medical knowledge and practice".I raised this matter on Committee Stage on the basis the Medical Council has a public education role which should be specified in the legislation.  While I appreciate the Minister made the point that this was sweeping, I expected a Government amendment on it and the Minister indicated she would table one.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I had this matter examined.  The medical profession specialist training bodies would have some expertise but other bodies such as the Irish Medicines Board would also have an interest.  As it evolves, HIQA could have a partial role in holding information on some of these matters.  On reflection, I consider this is not a role appropriate to the Medical Council and I discussed it with one or two staff members of the Medical Council.  The information required to implement this amendment is too wide and varied and would not always be available to the council on an ongoing basis.  While I appreciate the spirit of the amendment I consider it is not practical to assign this function to the Medical Council.

In page 17, line 44, after "order" to insert the following:"following consultation and agreement by the Council".I commend this amendment to the Minister.  I was unable to contribute to Second Stage due to a personal health setback.  I wish to take this opportunity to emphasise what was stated by my colleague, Deputy Crowe, who spoke on Second Stage on my behalf.  This Bill is necessary and its priority must be to ensure the best health care provision for patients through proper accountability and the highest standards of training for health professionals.The core of the Bill and the subject of these amendments is the reform of the Medical Council.  There has been much controversy on this matter and the representative bodies, both the IMO and the IHCA, were extremely pro-active.  The last meeting I had on the Thursday night was a first-time experience with the IHCA.  Little did I realise that within hours I would be dependent on their colleagues' professional services.The arguments around this Bill centre on whether there should be a lay or medical majority on the council.  I must state having given the arguments serious consideration, I do not have a difficulty with a lay majority.  Whatever the case may be, the real question is who will represent the interests of patients.  That is the most important thing to address.  In our assessment of the matter we must ask whether the new Medical Council will serve the patient better.  That is the question in the minds of most people, certainly all those interested in the passage of this legislation.What is being attempted in amendment No. 5 is to strike a balance between self-regulation and public accountability.  Taking on board that the immediate backdrop to the Bill is the dreadful experience of the women in the north east, as exposed through the Neary case, the shameful treatment of the women victims of that scandal, one must say that the Neary case was a classic example of self-regulation failing miserably and compounding the hurt and pain, as we saw in the address of the cases concerned by Mr. Neary's three colleagues.  Following that there can be no doubt in anyone's mind that change was absolutely essential.Legitimate concerns have been raised.  I have listened carefully to the arguments of the IHCA representatives and I respect the positions articulated.  They believe the Bill may in some respects go too far in one direction and confer too many powers on the Minister.  My amendments and those of others on this Stage of the Bill's passage attempt to address those concerns.Amendment No. 5 provides for consultation with, which is very important, and agreement of the new council before the Minister confers further functions or responsibilities on the council beyond those extensive powers and responsibilities already outlined in the Bill.  That is a reasonable proposal which gives recognition to the integrity of the council.  It makes very clear that the council is an integral component part of any consideration of future vesting of new responsibilities or remits.  Before any proposal to widen same, the Minister must consult and secure the agreement of the council.I commend the amendment to the Minister and hope she will recognise and appreciate the good sense in this and the good practice it would represent.  I expect that the Minister and the House collectively will receive a good-hearted response from the varying interests that this Bill seeks to address.  I commend the proposition to the Minister.  Consultation and agreement of the council should be central to this area, specifically the widening of powers and responsibilities of the council in the future.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	470	This seeks to simply reinstate the existing power under section 62 of the 1978 Act.  In case there is confusion, the purpose here is to assign additional functions connected with "registered medical practitioners, their education and training and the practice of medicine by medical practitioners" and "the implementation of any directive or regulation of the European Union concerning the practice of medicine, medical practitioners who practise medicine and the recognition of qualifications of medical practitioners exercising their right to freedom of movement within the European Union".  Clearly, any functions assigned to the council relate to these matters.There is also a provision under section 8(2), which states: "Every order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which the House has sat after that order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it."I should have stated at the outset that I am delighted to see the Deputy back.  I privately wished him well.  He seems to have got back to good health very quickly and I am delighted that is the case.

I am very grateful for that.This is an important measure.  There is a serious chasm between the position argued for by the representative interests, who have lobbied extensively, and what the Bill now proposes to do.  While I have indicated, as my colleague did on Second Stage, that I have no difficulty with the lay majority issue, I am, nevertheless, mindful of the arguments articulated very well to me some weeks back.  There is good cause and justification to take on board this measure, which ultimately leaves a responsibility on the council to determine the widening of its functions and remit.  We should accede to that and accommodate it in the passage of this Bill.  We should try to create a scenario where all interests will view the future role of the council and the whole area of governance, accountability and transparency of medical practice at all levels so that there is a broad welcome and a good heart — a pun I did not intend — towards an effective and efficient working relationship into the future.I urge the Minister again to reconsider this amendment.  Amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy McManus seeks to achieve the same result.  It is a very important issue.  I do not wish to see a gulf of distrust or distress arising out of the passage of this Bill, which I again describe as very necessary.I will reserve the position I will take on this to take into account the decisions arrived at in the course of this Report Stage.  I urge the Minister to reconsider and I commend the proposition once again.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I have made my response.  This is simply repeating in this legislation a provision that exists in the 1978 Act, which nobody would suggest has been abused.  It concerns the functions of the authority around medical education or the practice of medicine or EU directives.  It is not reasonable to have to consult a body to assign functions.  If a body were in a position to indicate it would not take the functions, another body would have to be established or the first body may have to be dissolved.  This is normal practice in much legislation and I do not believe anybody has ever been accused of abusing it.  As I have stated, it can be annulled by the Oireachtas.  In effect, it must be subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 18, to delete lines 24 to 32.While I welcome that the issue of professional conduct and ethics is excluded from the "general policy directions" in the section, there is a contradiction.  On the one hand, the Minister could give general direction on policy to the Medical Council, but the council need not abide by the direction on the other.  If it did not believe the direction to be in accordance with its functions, it could decide to fulfil its functions or not to limit its performance in the way it perceives it has been directed.  This contradiction would create a problem.I accept we are moving away from the old idea of pure self-regulation and a closed professional system into a new era, which is for the good, but we must also acknowledge the danger of professionals abdicating their roles if they feel alienated by the Bill's provisions and the establishment of the new council.  It is right that doctors must pay for the council via registration fees, but we should not remove the sense of ownership as we democratise the system.  For these reasons I tabled the amendment.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	474	There is a misunderstanding.  Deputy Ó Caoláin's amendment sought to insert the clause "following consultation and agreement by the Council", that is, a Minister would only give a direction or extend the council's functions if it was consulted.  It would be inappropriate to allow a council to decide against taking more functions.  It is not the case that the council can ignore the directions, as it is obliged to follow them.  They relate to public policy on education, EU directives and so on rather than operational, fitness to practise or ethical issues.I agree with Deputy McManus in that it is important that the profession has confidence in the council.  Regulatory bodies are to regulate in the public's interest, but it would be foolish not to regulate with the profession's confidence in the regulatory function.  The Bill aims to support doctors and regulate in the public interest.  The representative bodies have issues regarding the legislation and, on foot of some of the representations made, we made changes after the draft heads were published.  However, many doctors, particularly those who are younger, are happy with the legislation and will have confidence in it.Referring to a comment made by Deputy Ó Caoláin, the new council will probably not be appointed until July following the regulations being made and the elections taking place, but it would be my intention as the appointing Minister to appoint people who represent patients' interests in so far as they can be identified.  There are a number of organisations.  There are also extraordinary, talented and experienced people, notwithstanding the negative experiences in some cases, who have made invaluable contributions to public policy in a number of areas and who would make similar contributions to the functioning of the council.  The directions only relate to public policy issues, not operational or ethical matters.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Section 9(2) could create a conflict in that nothing "in directions given under subsection (1) is to be construed to prevent the Council from, or to limit the Council in, performing its functions".On patient representatives, I remind the Minister that when Professor Niamh Brennan examined the issue of reform of the health service and sought people to represent the public interest, thereby the patients, she could not find anyone to fit the bill as well as public representatives.  No one else is democratically elected.This is the difficulty of the idea of patient representatives.  There are patient organisations and able people speaking on behalf of patients, but there is a danger of self-appointed people carving out a role they may fill well, badly or inappropriately and to whom the checks and balances placed on public representatives do not apply.  I challenge the idea of patient representatives because it is a will o' the wisp.  It is not that people could not be found to speak on behalf of patients, but there are no patient representatives to whom one could point as having been chosen for that role.  This is a genuine difficulty to which I do not have a solution, but I would not use the term.

In page 19, lines 4 and 5, to delete "and in accordance with the request".This amendment relates to control, as the Bill over-eggs the pudding.  Throughout the Bill, the ministerial control of the council is not healthy or necessary.  The Minister can make an order or a request and the council can make rules for the purpose of better operation "in accordance with the request".  It sounds as if belts and braces must be used because the people in question are juvenile delinquents rather than sensible adults with considerable expertise.  It is unnecessary wording and I ask the Minister to delete it.

In page 22, lines 26 and 27, to delete all words from and including "in" in line 26 down to and including "Minister" in line 27.As with amendment No. 5, this amendment attempts to moderate the somewhat heavy-handed approach implicit in the original wording of the Bill, namely, "in a form and manner in accordance with any directions issued by the Minister".  Deputy McManus has accurately described the tenor of the Bill and this wording is another indication of a dictatorial approach on the part of the Minister and the Department.  While I have no problem with that approach, it is unnecessary, as there is a clear obligation on the council to do all that is provided for in section 13.The words I am seeking to delete have the further negative connotation of suggesting the strategy will be devised by the Minister or his or her office.  Implicit in what is stated is a dictation that the strategy will be determined in the Minister's office, not by the council.  I really do not think there can be any worthwhile outcome from the inclusion of those words in section 13, which requires the council to prepare and submit a statement of strategy.  As the Minister's hopes and aspirations are already catered for in section 13, it would not be weakened by the removal of these unnecessary words.  If we delete these words, this section will better reflect our approach and intent, in terms of the future working relationship in this regard.  Therefore, I commend this amendment to the Minister.

The Minister said she has met some young doctors who welcome this legislation.  I do not really believe that is true, although it does not matter very much.  My instinct tells me that most doctors do not care about the legislation or are not aware of it.  Like the rest of the public, doctors tend to pay little heed to what happens in the Dáil until the implications of legislation become apparent.  Very little has been said about the debates we have had on this legislation.  If one polled this country's 9,000 doctors to ascertain whether they have any idea of what we are talking about in this instance, one would find that most of them know little about it.Most of this Bill is quite technical.  The sections of the Bill providing for ministerial direction will change the Medical Council quite fundamentally.  I am not sure that it should be called the Medical Council any more.  Its role is being broadened so that it will not just involve keeping doctors in check.  The council will also be charged with examining the role of medicine throughout the health service, for example.  Last week, we considered legislation on the Health Information and Quality Authority, which is being established because the HSE currently both purchases and provides nursing home services.  It also sets standards in the nursing home sector and checks that those standards are being upheld.  Nothing or very little was done over many years — certainly, patients were not protected.  When the problems at Leas Cross, for example, hit the headlines, there was a slow movement to protect nursing home patients.  I recently read an article which mentioned that Professor Des O'Neill's initial report on Leas Cross was half the size of the report that was eventually published by the HSE.  Various officials in the HSE had to include various appendices to make clear they did not really do anything wrong, they should not be blamed, they did everything they could and somebody else was at fault.  It was the patients who ultimately suffered.This House decided last week to take the HSE out of the nursing home sector.  We agreed to establish an independent organisation, the Health Information and Quality Authority, to set standards.  We also gave the Social Services Inspectorate the responsibility for protecting patients in the nursing home sector.  The Minister has also introduced the Medical Practitioners Bill 2007, under which HSE officials will be put on the board of the Medical Council.  She has decided to subsume the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, which is responsible for specialist training of doctors and dentists and postgraduate research, into the HSE so that it is no longer an independent organisation.  It appears that the Medical Council will have a role in the training and specialisation of doctors, thereby affecting the way in which they can register as specialists.  It seems that this measure is being taken on foot of proposals from the HSE.  I understand that the HSE will have a bearing on what will happen with regard to the competence assurance of doctors.  The Minister has proposed that it will depend on resources being made available to the HSE.  The Minister has taken from the HSE the power to simultaneously decide on standards and govern what happens within a certain part of the health service — the nursing homes sector.  However, she has also introduced a Bill regarding medicine to put the HSE in charge of doctors, more or less.I was a little surprised by the manner in which the Minister spoke about the HSE this morning.  I refer to her comment that co-location is an issue for the HSE and has nothing to do with her.  I find it fascinating that the HSE is now like "Big Brother", or like a computer that is more or less running itself.  As a result of this legislation, the HSE is now in charge of the health services.  Some people do not give a hoot about self-regulation and lay majorities.  Most doctors are not engaging in this debate at all.  They seldom get engaged in debates of this nature, other than when problems like those encountered at Leas Cross emerge.  When something goes seriously wrong in the health services — Leas Cross was not the only example of such a difficulty — we should stand back and question how it was allowed to happen.  In this day and age, how in God's name did those who were responsible for the inspection of nursing homes, including administrators who were being very well paid to protect elderly patients, not only fail to notice what was going on in such homes but also seem to allow it to happen without doing anything about it?In 20 years' time, people will probably ask how in God's name we allowed legislation of this nature, which seems to give more powers to the Minister, to be passed in 2007.  The Minister knows that such powers can easily be abused.  Policy directions can easily be issued to quieten things down.  The Minister has given herself the ultimate sanction of being able to threaten privately or publicly to remove some or all of the members of the Medical Council if they do not play ball.  She has given incredible power to the HSE, which will be represented on the board of the Medical Council, and some other organisations that are linked to the Government, rather than to the protection of patients.  The HSE is not about protecting patients.  Many of the organisations and individuals which will be represented on the new Medical Council, such as the Royal Irish Academy, the Minister for Education and Science, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Independent Hospital Association of Ireland, have nothing to do with patient safety.  They are part of the mechanism of government.The HSE and its Government allies will control things quite significantly.  That is why I want to take the provision relating to ministerial responsibility out of the Bill.  I have said that if I were the Minister for Health and Children, I would hate to have so much control over the Medical Council directly, which is what the ministerial responsibility provisions give the Minister, or indirectly, by means of the authority of the HSE and some of the other organisations which will now be part of the Medical Council.  The ministerial appointment provisions could be bad for patient safety.  I do not think it is a good idea to appoint to boards four or five people who usually have some connection with the Government.  The Taoiseach has said that he puts his friends, rather than donors, on State bodies.  That is what happens — it is a fact of life.I do not think what we are doing has occurred to the Minister or to the majority of people.  The general public is not engaged in this debate at all, but it will be interested in it in years to come when a report is published on what went wrong in the case of some serious disaster.  I am not sure we have protected patients in the right way.  I have asked the Minister previously to point out where the huge problems of which she has been made aware arise within the Medical Council, as it currently exists, or in the context of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978.  It is important that some sort of critique be done on the effect on the Medical Council of the legislation before the House.  I do not think the sort of ministerial authority that is being copper-fastened by this Bill was envisaged by anybody.  It was envisaged that we would have proper systems of registration and competence assurance of doctors.  It was intended to leave training to the training bodies.  The Medical Council was supposed to have a specific role in maintaining standards and ensuring that bad doctors are rooted out of the system.  The Minister has taken it a step too far.We might rue the day that we brought this legislation through the House.  The provisions contradict what the Minister is doing in other legislation, including the legislation we voted on last week.  None of it is based on patient safety.  Those who drafted the Bill in respect of HIQA had a different mind set to those who drafted the Medical Practitioners Bill.  I do not know what will happen with the Pharmacy Bill and whether further amendments will be tabled before I read it tonight.  That changed dramatically between Tuesday and Thursday.  This is confused thinking.  I am confused by it and, after 20 years in the health service, I am interested in this area.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	487	It was a social occasion in a private home and the only aspect we discussed was the lay majority.  We did not discuss the minutiae of this Bill.  Most people rely on their representative bodies or read the media and take an interest only if it is relevant to them.  Doctors are concerned that minor matters and vexatious complaints will not result in an appearance before fitness to practice inquiries and their professionalism and reputation queried in an unfair fashion.  The Prospectus and Brennan reports drew attention to the need for greater accountability by public bodies in the health sector.  In line with initiatives by the Department of Finance with regard to public bodies in general, the Department of Health and Children issued a framework of governance document that is in line with this Bill.  It outlines the form the strategy statement should take rather than the content.  It should conform with the form that applies to all regulatory and statutory bodies under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.Competence assurance is a fundamental part of this Bill but we must wait a while before it is in place.  Power in this regard is important for patient safety.  A range of mechanisms are open to the Medical Council, including the preliminary hearings committee, the health committee and the mediation process.  Fitness to practice applies to serious cases and immunity for doctors who report others is a matter that concerns doctors.  We did not agree with everything proposed during our widespread consultation but much of this Bill is informed by representations and consultation, before and after the heads of the Bill were published.The only duty of a member of the Medical Council is to the council.  The member does not sit in a representative capacity to report to another.  It is important to have a broader perspective on the council and on bodies generally.  This can inform the work of a regulatory body.I am accused of having too much control.  When the Accounting Officer position was given to the HSE I was accused of giving away too much power.  It seems I cannot win.  Policy is decided by the Minister and the Government and its implementation is a matter for the HSE.  It is not my role to receive tenders for co-location, sign contracts or decide on weightings.  I do not have the competence to do so, nor would it be appropriate.  That is the role of the HSE, availing of expertise to inform it, including outside legal expertise.The amendment is in line with what is required of all public bodies under the aegis of the Department.  It is good practice in respect of accountability and effectiveness.

I refer to section 13, requiring the council to match the expectation of the Minister and the Department in respect of the statement of strategy.  These words are unnecessary and equate to the strategy being drafted in the Minister's office.  It may not happen but it might as well.  This is implicit in the manner in which this is presented.  This further deepens the discontent.  It is within the Minister's gift to remove this provision from section 13 and embark on a minor but important healing process.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	489	It is in line with what is required of other public bodies.  The Minister of the day may receive a strategy statement within six months of taking office.  The statement must deal with the performance of the functions of the regulatory body, in this case, the Medical Council.  The statement may contain information on the number of inquiries.  The norm will be for such inquiries to be held in public and there will be more information available.  It is in the public interest to know how many complaints were received, how many were filtered by the preliminary hearings committee, how many were health issues and how many went to mediation.  These are required in a strategy statement.  Members of the Houses are constantly asking me such questions.  At present we receive broad information from the Medical Council.  This is a good practice and is nothing more than exists in other legislation.  The Prospectus and Brennan reports drew attention to the need for greater clarity and better information.  For accountability and effectiveness it is a good for organisations to have strategy statements.  Departments publish them and they are the subject of public debate.  This focuses the minds of those who operate in such organisations, such as Ministers and public officials.

In page 22, to delete lines 36 to 39.This refers to the same issue of ministerial control.When we talked this morning, it was clear that An Bord Altranais, which is responsible for nursing and midwifery training, will remain independent, as will the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which looks after the training of paramedics and ambulance staff.  Even some of the bodies the Minister is talking about such as An Bord Altranais, the Royal Irish Academy, the Health Information Quality Authority and the Independent Hospitals Association of Ireland, all have boards of management with limited powers as well.  The Minister is hell-bent on radically changing the Medical Council and not just as regards self-regulation and making it a lay majority.  She is making quite radical changes as well as regards training.There is a need for many of the changes, but like the competence assurance issue, the Minister is still unsure as to how this will work, apart from the fact she admitted on Committee Stage that it could take up to five years to achieve.  That means, in order to root out individuals who must be watched as regards their competence, this will take quite some time.  There should be faster ways of doing that.  Even as regards education and training, words such as co-operation, collaboration and co-ordination tend to proliferate.  Regardless of what changes are being proposed, care must be taken, especially when training bodies for doctors and dentists are being subsumed into the HSE in the manner the Minister is doing.  The HSE has not covered itself in glory in its two years in existence.  There is a need for far greater clarity and it is missing in this legislation.As regards these amendments, since they were not accepted on Committee Stage, I shall withdraw them.

In page 24, line 12, after "Council," to insert "and".I want to press, in particular in amendment No. 16, that the council shall, in preparing a business plan, "have regard to the policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government as they relate to the functions of the Council".  If we are getting rid of self-regulation and introducing a lay majority we should at least give the council some independence, one way or another.  Removing its independence in the manner the Minister has done has neutered the Medical Council to a significant degree.  The Medical Council has a role to play.  It is akin to the question I have previously asked about what was so wrong with the 1978 legislation and the Medical Council as it is constituted that such a heavy-handed approach as regards ministerial responsibility is required.  Why can it not remain independent?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	495	It is an independent body as regards operational, ethical issues and so on.  However, as a body it also has an important role as regards some public policy issues around educational training, workforce planning perhaps, and the implementation of EU directives.  As regards the training issues Deputy Twomey mentioned, we are implementing the Buttimer report.  The HSE is responsible for logistics and co-ordination, but the Medical Council is the quality authority in so far as education and training are concerned, and that is an important distinction.  Earlier we mentioned the role of HIQA and that of the HSE, the service provider on the one hand, and the quality or standards authority on the other.  Obviously the training bodies have an enormous role to play, but it is a matter for the Medical Council to decide on the appropriateness of training and provide for the registration of doctors, both general practitioners and specialists.The Deputy asked me what was wrong with the legislation.  Clearly we have learned a good deal and much has changed in the intervening 30 years.  Medical regulation all over the world is changing as we have to in light of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  This legislation has been sought by the Medical Council for quite some time.  Most of its provisions refer to requests made or the informed views of the Medical Council, from its experience, particularly as regards issues to do with training, education and competence assurance.  Then there is the capacity of the council to be able to recruit people onto committees.  These types of initiatives have come about in response to suggestions made by the council because of the major difficulties, challenges and workloads of its individual members, most of whom are very busy people.  To try to allocate the time required under the current approach where one has to be a member of the council to serve on various committees is very onerous.  This causes difficulties and pressure points for the council.  Much of what we are doing is to respond to the views of the council.

Did it also agree there should be strong ministerial control over policy and direction and see this as a positive issue, or did it have concerns as regards the removal of the council's independence to such a significant degree?  I am not talking about the lay majority stuff, but rather about——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	497	To be fair to the council, I do not believe it advocated a lay majority.  I met the Medical Council after the heads of the Bill were published.  We took on board many of its suggestions.  I met it after the Bill was published, and again we made some changes based in particular on what I have said earlier, about case law being the appropriate test for the fitness to practise issue.  We also agreed on some other areas.  For example, we have removed in so far as it is practicable, difficulties in terms of the HSE having to provide for competence assurance.  The HSE will have to do that and resources will not be an issue.Subject to correction, I do not believe the Medical Council takes the view that there is a good deal of ministerial control and direction here, although perhaps some of its members might.  Assigning new functions was in the existing Act.  We did not have the type of corporate governance structures and framework for public bodies in place in 1978.  Much has changed over the years and a greater level of accountability has come about in the intervening period.  It was not an era of strategy statements and business plans.  Public bodies did not operate to that type of agenda almost 30 years ago, so things have changed a good deal.

Doctors had an affinity with the Medical Council.  A doctor felt a complaint against him or her was being examined by his or her peers.  This affinity could disappear if the council is appointed solely by the Minister.  One way of maintaining its independence is having a proportion of the council elected by the medical profession, while maintaining the lay majority appointed by the Minister.  Such a structure would be closer to a partnership rather than a structure being imposed on doctors.

Many times, my Sinn Féin colleagues and I have raised the unacceptability of the manner in which people are appointed to State bodies.  This Bill is different in that the members of the Medical Council will be nominated by specified bodies.  Five lay people will be appointed by the Minister.  As we have highlighted however, there is no way for any citizen to access these positions or offer their services or expertise to such bodies.  There is no provision for this in the Bill or any other legislation presented to the House in the past five or more years.  There is no openness in the process which requires address.  In deference to my colleagues in the Green Party, their private Members' Bill will seek to address this serious deficiency.  I will support their Bill when it is voted on later tonight.As it is expected that the Government will not accept the Green Party private Members' Bill, I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 20.  It will allow for an additional safeguard in the whole process of the appointment of lay persons to the council.  This will serve at least two purposes.  It will temper the extensive powers, highlighted by all Opposition Members, that the Minister is providing for vis-à-vis the role of the council.  It will also add substance to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and strengthen its scrutiny role.

It is important that people feel engaged with the proposed council structure.  It is easy for people to walk away and not get involved in this type of project.  People are busier, work is getting tougher and the days seem to be getting shorter.  All these pressures are on people who give up their time to represent their profession.  In terms of trust, it should be possible to allow the profession to nominate the persons it feels are best rather than have this oversight structure that pervades the legislation.In the past the Minister made the appointments but we should be able to trust these professional bodies in making their choices.  I am not certain we can always trust Ministers.  Deputy Twomey referred to the Taoiseach's approach to appointments to State boards which hardly inspires confidence.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to examine this section.  I wanted to make it clear there was no question of a Minister not accepting those elected.  That is why I tabled amendment No. 26 which states the Minister may not refuse to appoint as a member of the council a person nominated by a professional body.When I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I was involved in nominating persons to InterTrade Ireland.  The Sinn Féin Party directly nominated a person to the body who, the chairman informed me, made an excellent contribution.  I recently nominated a Fine Gael Party public representative to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  I like to think I look out for good people to nominate to appropriate bodies.  That is the intention with this section.On Committee Stage, Deputies were concerned that the specified bodies may elect persons to the council which the Minister may refuse to endorse.  That is not the intention.  Amendment No. 26 introduces clarity in this section to ensure the Minister shall not refuse nominations by those bodies which have powers to nominate to the council.

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle said that amendments No. 19 to 21, inclusive, are technical alternatives to the same Part of the Bill and amendment No. 26 was related.  In effect we took the three amendments in that context.

In page 25, line 26, after "Minister" to insert the following:", following consultation and approval by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children".It is almost like Ballinspittle; I feel something has moved here.  With reference to amendment No. 20, the Minister did not comment on the proposal in the amendment regarding the possibility of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children having a role in the approval and determination of five lay people who would serve on the council.  Is the Minister prepared to accede to this proposal in respect of that committee?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	518	No.  If five people were to appear before a committee, it would be extremely controversial.  I can give the Deputy an assurance that if he wants to put forward suggestions to me, I will be more than happy to consider them.  I often sit in ministerial office talking to officials.  If one considers the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, which met for the first time on Monday, one would note that its members are extremely competent and highly trained individuals.  There was widespread consultation on the establishment of that council.  The Deputy made a valid point in highlighting that there may be excellent people in the country who do not know how to go about being nominated.  I would be delighted to facilitate a role for people making suggestions and they would be taken very seriously.

In page 27, line 24, to delete "paediatrics" and substitute "anaesthesia".I table these amendments as a result of consultation with the Medical Council.  I was concerned that the provisions, as drafted, in the original Bill would not have given an option for a range of specialties to ever hold seat on the Medical Council.  Therefore, I have proposed an amendment to provide, first, that the specialty of anaesthesia, which has an important role, will have a seat on the council.  The effect of this change also means that the specialties of pathology and radiology will share one seat on the council instead of having the right to sit on every thirdcouncil.I propose removing the guaranteed place for geriatrics and paediatrics as many of the issues affecting these specialties can be covered by others who are represented on the council.  This leaves one open elected position which I hope will satisfy the concerns expressed to me by the Medical Council.  As I have stated before, the council can include a much broader range of expertise, both medical and non-medical, on all its committees.Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 are technical and consequential.

In page 30, line 14, after "satisfied" to insert the following:"on the recommendation of the President of the Council".I make the same point in regard to this amendment.  I feel I am repeating myself over and over in speaking about the partnership that should exist between the Minister and the Medical Council.  I propose that the recommendation of the president of the council should be included in the Bill to acknowledge the important place the president holds and the important role the Medical Council plays in regard to this issue.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	530	On the face of it, this seems reasonable, but if the president, himself or herself, was the person to be removed, it would be difficult to see him or her recommending that.  A member of the council can only be removed in specific circumstances such as illness, stated misbehaviour and matters covered under the ethics in public office legislation.  A member cannot be removed because he or she is someone the Minister of the day does not like.  A member can only be removed for particular reasons and I do not believe it has ever happened in the past.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I move amendment No. 32:
In page 31, line 7, to delete "Where" and substitute "Subject to subsection (7), where".I gave a commitment to examine this matter for Report Stage.  The amendments I now propose will provide that the removal of council from office under the terms of subsections (5) and (6) will require that a ministerial order, or draft of which, must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The draft must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the order.  The order cannot take effect, unless a resolution approving it is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendment to subsection (11) provides for the continuation of the performance of the council's functions in any such situation.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I welcome the Minister's amendment in this regard.  It is a great improvement.  I am glad she has lived up to her commitment.  She was sympathetically disposed towards the amendment I put forward.  I like her amendment because it also allows for more than the process whereby a document is placed in the Library and we have 21 days to respond to it.  The provision in this respect is specific; a decision must be made in effect and approval given by each House.  That is a much more appropriate approach.  It gives significance to something which may never be happen but which would be a major and serious decision for a Minister to make.  The fact that it will be made by the Oireachtas rather than an individual Minister is appropriate to the importance of such a decision.I appreciate it is not fair to do this but I am still trying to chase up the statutory instrument in relation to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	534	It has not been made; it was issued for consultation.

In page 35, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:"(8) A disclosure under this section or section 31 shall be recorded in a register together with particulars of any interest of members of the Council or committee or persons to whom section 31 applies, and the register shall be available to public inspection during office hours.”.This amendment deals with disclosure of interests being recorded in a register.  We must get our act together regarding issues to do with conflict of interest.  We have seen how easy it is for people to exert influence within the health service without the checks and balances that apply in other countries.  The register should be available for public scrutiny.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	546	This is a question as to whether the Medical Council should be required to go further than the requirements under the ethics in public office legislation and the standards in public office legislation.  The council is required to comply with both codes of conduct and it would not be fair to single out the Medical Council for any greater scrutiny.  I do not disagree with some of the points made by Deputy McManus regarding the need to have any conflicts of interest or disclosures appropriately dealt with under a code of conduct which the HSE now has for anybody appointed to positions in the HSE.  Members are required to sign a register and declare their interests.

I do not know whether it only applies to the council members.  It would obviously apply to the CEO or the registrar under public office legislation but I will check.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	551	It is more important that there is transparency regarding people who are co-opted on to committees.  Everybody will know who is on the Medical Council but people can be drawn in who are quite distant from the Medical Council and who may have all sorts of reasons to want to gain influence.  We need to be absolutely scrupulous and tough about any possibility of conflict of interest arising that is not known and understood and recorded.  This is an important issue we need to address.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I will revert to the Deputy.  If the ethics in public office legislation does not apply to people co-opted on to committees then perhaps a code of conduct would be appropriate.  I will take advice.

The chief executive officer of the HSE is covered by codes of conduct and by the ethics in public office legislation but his advisers are not, even though they would have as much say and as much authority in the way policies are formulated because of their expertise which is also the reason they are acting as his special advisers.

In page 38, line 40, to delete "after consulting" and substitute "on the recommendation of".We must be conscious that the balance is shifting in this Bill and there is a danger that it will shift to the point where people will simply feel disengaged.  A process that works very well is one where the Minister responds through recommendation rather than simply consulting.  The word consulting is the most abused word in the English language.  Everybody consults all the time but that does not mean that it makes a blind bit of difference.  Anybody who has served on a local authority knows this.  Where there is consultation after all the decisions have been made is not a productive use of anybody's time.

In page 39, line 5, to delete "and".The Deputy and I have a similar interest here.  I have sought advice on the matter and in the interest of fairness I recognise that time must be given to persons using a particular title in advance of implementation of regulations to either achieve the standards required for its use or to allow them an adequate opportunity to stop using it in advance of the implementation of the regulations.  I therefore propose an amendment to section 39(2) to make it clear that the regulations would provide for this to happen.

In page 39, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(c) the regulations made in exercise of that power provide that a person who was, immediately before the commencement of the regulations, lawfully using the title but who, on that commencement, would contravene section 40(2) if the person continued to use the title, may continue to use the title for the period specified in the regulations (being a period reasonable in the circumstances but, in any case, not less that 6 months) without contravening that section.”.

In page 41, to delete lines 27 and 28 and substitute the following:"(3) The register may be established and maintained in paper or electronic form.".On Committee Stage Deputy Twomey raised the matter of the meaning of section 43(3) and I undertook to consult with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Accordingly, I propose an amendment which I hope clarifies the matter sufficiently for the Deputy.  According to legal advice there must be one definitive version of the register, whether in paper or in electronic format.   The alternative format can only be a reproduction of the register at any particular time.  That is the reason the phrase "in paper or electronic form or both" is not used in this provision.

In page 42, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(9) A registered medical practitioner shall not be required to register his or her home address in any part of the register which is open to public access.".The IMO is concerned, with some justification, about the issue of security.  Having been married to a GP for many years, I am aware that the family home becomes a place to which people readily come if they find themselves in difficulties.  As a result, one's family home can appear to be somewhat exposed at times.  I am of the opinion that the IMO was correct to raise this matter.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I move amendment No. 51:
In page 49, line 12, to delete "A" and substitute "Subject to subsections (2) and (7), a”.I understand why Deputy Twomey has concerns in respect of this provision.  However, it is included for the purpose of correctly transposing certain provisions of Directive 2005/36/EC, which relates to the provision of services on a temporary and occasional basis by visiting medical practitioners.  The provisions of the directive reflect case law of the European court of Justice which has stated that the provision of services cannot be delayed unnecessarily by requiring a person who is lawfully established in another member state to again undergo a full registration process in the member state he or she is visiting.  However, the directive provides for a process of temporary, automatic or pro forma registration to be undertaken to allow for the application of disciplinary procedures in the host member state.  In this way the directive differentiates between registration for the purposes of a more permanent establishment and registration for the temporary and occasional provision of services.  I hope what I have said may reassure the Deputy.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I move amendment No. 53:
In page 54, line 16, after "offence" to insert the following:"(being an offence which does or could potentially reflect on the registered medical practitioner's fitness to practice medicine)"I made a point on Committee Stage regarding types of offences.  The category of offences triable on indictment are extremely broad and a complaint could be made in respect of an offence that has nothing to do with a medical practitioner's fitness to practice medicine.  Such an offence could, for example, relate to an infringement of planning or traffic laws.  The provision appears too loose to ensure that the complaints process will not be availed of in a way that is inappropriate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I accept the Deputy's point but it is difficult to rule things in or out.  I am advised that if a complaint is not related to medical practice, the preliminary hearings committee will be able to dispose of the matter very quickly.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I have a difficulty with that because there can be a timeframe involved.  We are discussing people's livelihood and reputation.  If someone loses trust in his or her doctor, it is quite difficult for that trust to be won back.  If a person makes a complaint that is completely without grounds because it is based on some offence that has nothing to do with the practice of medicine, he or she could still argue that the complaint has been put forward and that the Medical Council should pursue it.  The council may decide that the complaint is frivolous and without foundation.  However, it will still be obliged to consider the complaint and it can take time to do so.  In the interim, the medical practitioner who is the subject of the complaint would be in a vulnerable position.A certain security would be provided if a complaint could not be received or considered by the Medical Council because it did not adhere to the requirements of the legislation.  It would prevent crazy people from making complaints to the council on all sorts of grounds if it was possible to check an offence against the list provided in the legislation.  If an offence is clearly disconnected from the practice of medicine, a complaint should be immediately thrown out.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Section 57 specifies that the grounds for a complaint to be made must relate to professional misconduct, poor professional performance, a relevant medical disability, a contravention of a provision of the legislation or a conviction in the State for an offence triable on indictment, which would be a serious matter.  It is not, therefore, possible to make a complaint in respect of a trivial issue.  We took legal advice and were informed that it is difficult to restrict matters any further.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I referred to road traffic offences but these are not included in the list outlined in section 57.  There are, however, other offences such as technical breaches of the Planning Acts or the Companies Acts.  An offence could, therefore, be committed in circumstances that have nothing to do with the practice of medicine and the matter would have to go before the Medical Council if a complaint was made.  The council would then be obliged to waste time making a decision on a frivolous complaint and the practitioner to whom it related would be left swinging in the wind.  Due to the fact that provision is made in the legislation, the person bringing the complaint would be in a position to justify his or her actions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	593	We took specific advice on this matter, the substance of which was that we should not change the provision.  I agree with what the Deputy is saying and we do not want the Medical Council to deal with planning issues — it will not do so — or issues that have nothing to do with a doctor's fitness to practice.  The council is not supposed to investigate any other matters even though, I am sure, vexatious complaints will be made from time to time by people who do not like particular doctors.  Essentially, the legislation is only designed to deal with professional issues.  I will take further advice and see if we can take on board the Deputy's concerns.  I do not disagree with what she is saying, it is merely a question of whether we can do what she asks.

In page 54, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:"(2) A complaint shall be made on a form prescribed by the Council and shall contain sufficient particulars to enable the registered medical practitioner to which the complaint relates to respond to the complaint.".It is stating the obvious but sufficient information and particulars should be supplied in order to enable a medical practitioner to respond to a complaint.  This is such a serious matter, there should be a requirement as to the nature of how a complaint is formulated.  A complaint must be clear and comprehensive so that can a medical practitioner can respond to it in a way in which justice demands.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	596	What the Deputy is seeking to achieve is covered in sections 59(3)(a) and (b), which give autonomy to the committee and thus provide greater flexibility because it can prescribe the form in which a complaint should be made etc.  We are trying to strike a balance between being fair to doctors, the persons against whom complaints are made and also to complainants.  Section 107(2)(a) provides that a specified form may include a statutory declaration.

In page 73, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words from and including "with" in line 18 down to and including "Minister" where it firstly occurs in line 19 and substitute "after it".I propose an amendment in lieu of Deputy Twomey's amendment No. 65 to section 88(2)(a).  I am satisfied there is no particular requirement for the council to obtain the consent of the Minister for Health and Children on the approval of programmes of basic medical education and training, and the bodies to deliver these programmes.  I have taken on board Deputy Twomey’s amendment.

In page 80, lines 24 and 25, after "practitioners" to insert the following:"pursuant to a professional competence scheme applicable to the practitioners concerned".I gave a commitment to Deputies McManus and Twomey that I would introduce amendments on Report Stage linking section 91, in which the Medical Council is required to establish a professional competence scheme or schemes.  The purpose of these amendments is to make clear that the duties of medical practitioners and employers, including the HSE, relate to any such professional competence scheme established under section 91 so that there is no doubt about it.

In page 80, to delete lines 29 and 30 and substitute the following:"94.—(1) The Health Service Executive and the registered medical practitioner shall ensure that practitioner's professional competence is maintained on an ongoing basis.".The problem here is resourcing the competence assurance.  The Minister has stated she has given a commitment that the resourcing of the competence assurance will be looked after by the HSE, but it is not guaranteed that the HSE will take full responsibility for resourcing.  It is quite possible that registered medical practitioners could also see their fee for registration with the Medical Council increase dramatically to pay for the cost of this.  As the Minister will be aware, medical registration is already a significant cost and this could add considerably to it.  She has not made quite clear for how much resources the HSE would be responsible.  Will the Department be responsible for the full costs of competence assurance?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	619	In the Bill, as published, there was a reference to the HSE facilitating "to the extent practicable", and the Medical Council made the point of asking what that meant, for instance, if it meant they can use resources.  We got rid of that for the reason Deputy Twomey outlined.The cost of competence assurance has not been determined yet.  We know the cost to the Medical Council of administering competence assurance.  Having heard from the Medical Council, I felt it was important the State would have to pay up here.  We have not determined the extent to which the State will have to pay up, but certainly the idea is that it will be a large proportion of the cost.

I considered the Bill in detail earlier in light of last night's debate and, while it is thought provoking, I do not support it.  The explanatory memorandum states:Public bodies are an essential feature of governance in Ireland and important decisions affecting the lives of people are taken by individuals appointed to the boards of these bodies. The present procedures for appointing board chairpersons and members are diverse and badly defined. This has the potential of giving elite groups a monopoly of such positions and therefore an inordinate degree of influence on decision making.  Renewed public confidence is required in the integrity of procedures and there is a need to eradicate any element of patronage.  This Bill seeks to establish an independent merit based appointment system, through a new institutional framework which will allow for a systematic and transparent process of selection and appointments.  This will ultimately enhance accountability and rigor in these bodies.While there is merit in what Deputy Boyle is trying to achieve, the processes outlined in the Bill will not achieve what he wants.  Last night he stated:The overwhelming majority of those selected to serve on State bodies are individuals of ability who contribute out of a sense of public spiritedness.  However, we must make a distinction between the people who are chosen and the methods used to select them.The Deputy is correct that most of those appointed to State bodies are individuals of ability and my concern is if the Bill is adopted, those people who are targeted currently would not be attracted because of the bureaucracy and recruitment competitions proposed.  In corporate Ireland, when large companies recruit board members, people are head hunted based on ability, talent and expertise.  Many of the individuals serving on State bodies would not respond to the procedures envisaged in the legislation.One of the strengths of the present system is that Ministers can approach those they consider to have the qualities necessary to serve on the boards for which they are responsible.  Many men and women on State boards have vast experience in business or other relevant areas of public life and they have willingly accepted their positions out of a sense of public duty.  I doubt many of them would go through the process envisaged in the legislation.  Such an approach would be appropriate for recruiting employees but not directors and chairpersons of State bodies.  There is a difference between full-time employment and the work done by the members of various boards.  These individuals have ability but I am concerned that they would not respond to the procedures envisaged in the legislation.The Deputy also stated in his contribution that, "The Bill proposes several simple measures that can help restore public confidence in the system".  This suggests an absence of public confidence but I disagree.  Many boards are respected and a substantial number operate effectively over a wide range of areas.  The assertion that public confidence is lacking in all these boards does not stand up to the scrutiny.The Deputy further stated:It suggests that all public appointments to State bodies and agencies [...] should, in the first instance, be approved.  We propose that an Oireachtas committee on appointments to public bodies be established.However, this introduces another layer of bureaucracy.  There are approximately 600 State bodies, many of whose boards comprise 12 members.  More than 7,000 people, therefore, serve on these bodies and the Deputy proposes that they should be appointed through a recruitment competition overseen by a new Oireachtas joint committee.  That would involve considerable work.The Deputy seeks the establishment of the joint committee to carry out a review of all the procedures in place for the appointments of chairpersons and board members of existing bodies and to establish a list of such appointments, which should henceforth adhere to the new procedures.  That involves significant work for many bodies.  It removes from Ministers what should rightfully be their responsibility and introduces another layer of bureaucracy.It is normal commercial practice for the shareholder to nominate people to the board to look after the shareholder's interest.  In the case of commercial semi-State bodies, the Minister with the relevant financial responsibility for the area will nominate appointees to the board taking account of the type of company involved.  Obviously, the Minister for Finance, as a shareholder or joint shareholder, is consulted on the nomination.  This system is in place and works well.I make this point because it could be construed from the introduction of this Bill that people who are appointed to boards are able to go about their business freely.  However, it is worth mentioning that people who are appointed to boards do not have a free hand as there are strict rules and guidelines in place.  As recently as 2001, the Minister for Finance issued the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Its purpose was to provide a governance framework within which the internal management and internal and external reporting relationships of State bodies was to take place.  It is important to realise this point because one could draw the inference from the Bill that one appoints people to State boards and so be it.  However, nothing could be further from the truth as clear guidelines of codes of practice exist for the governance of such State bodies.I wish to take issue with two points made by Deputy Gogarty during last night's debate.  He stated:The same would apply for any other State body such as those in the education field, for example.  In the case of a number of Bills... which I have been involved [in] during [the] Government's term of office, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has been requested to allow certain bodies representation on a board and various education partners have been requested to be on the boards concerned because of their specific skill[s]. ...  The Minister has always stated that she retains the right to appoint and she will weigh it up on balance.  That is not good for democracy.I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Gogarty as I believe this constitutes democracy at work.  The Minister of the day makes the decision.  Democracy has allowed that person to be elected to this House and subsequently to the office and that is our procedure of accountability.  People are held accountable and the point made by Deputy Gogarty misrepresents and misunderstands the position.  The State has accountability and democracy and the election of the Minister to this House in the first instance and subsequently to the position of Minister constitutes democracy at work.Deputy Gogarty made a further point that was at a tangent or not relevant to the Bill and which was mistaken and regretful.  He mentioned a number of people by name in respect of South Dublin County Council.  While I will not repeat the names, he mentioned in particular a former councillor on South Dublin County Council who now works as an agent to a developer in the area.  Deputy Gogarty stated:These are all people trying to do their jobs in private enterprise and there should be no aspersions cast on their good character, but public bodies and public servants going to work in the private sector should be subject to some form of control.While I do not disagree with his point, the area he raised last night is not relevant to or reflected in this Bill in any way.  It was unfortunate that individuals' names were raised in the House last night in the context of this Bill, and it should not have happened.  The Bill does not reflect the type of issue that Deputy Gogarty was trying to raise.This matter was particularly unfortunate in the case of the former member of South Dublin County Council, who was a councillor for a considerable time.  I understand he was first elected in 1991.  In those days, the level of remuneration received by councillors was quite small and I know he had the same full-time job then as he does today.  It was unfortunate that the matter was raised in the House, where he does not have an opportunity to defend himself.  Moreover, it was not relevant to the Bill and on those grounds it was unfortunate that Deputy Gogarty raised it.While I found the Bill interesting, it will not achieve Deputy Boyle's intended objectives.  The procedures add nothing but another layer of bureaucracy and those with expertise, ability and talent, who one tries to draw into such bodies and boards, will not respond to the type of public advertisement and recruitment procedures this Bill tries to set out.  In that regard, I regret I will be unable to support the Bill.

Reference has been made to this Bill which, unfortunately, I cannot support for a number of reasons.  However, it has generated debate, which is positive.  It has kept Members in the House on a night when I would be happy to be in Croke Park, cheering on Richard Dunne from Tallaght and the Irish team.  However, I will conduct my business and then watch the match on television.As for the business before the House, Members should understand that the Private Members' Bill that has been tabled by their Green Party colleague proposes the creation of new procedures for the chair and boards of public bodies and for special appointments to international organisations that are at the discretion of the Government at present.  Clearly, this is the reason Government Members do not support the Bill.I speak as someone who did not serve on major State boards.  However, over time, I was appointed to a number of different bodies.  As Minister of Health after the 1987 general election, the current Ceann Comhairle appointed me to the board of St. James's Hospital and subsequently to the Tallaght Hospital board.  I was also appointed by other Ministers, not all of whom were members of Fianna Fáil, including the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, who kindly appointed me to a hospital board.  In addition, I was appointed to the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children, as well as to Gaisce, the President's awards.  The relevant point in respect of the Bill and people's comments on it is that I always considered such appointments to be from the Minister of the day, including a Labour Party Minister, who examined the skills that people possessed.  I never pretended to be anything other than what I was.  However, I would not have been appointed to those bodies at that time were it not for my community background.  I do not make this point in a virtuous way.  It gave me an insight into the manner in which such boards were set up and how Governments work in that regard.I was also appointed in 1996 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, to the Government's Devolution Commission.  At the time I was a lone Fianna Fáil representative on that body.  When considering a Bill like this, one has time to reflect on such appointments, which involved all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds with all sorts of skills.Deputy Curran made the relevant point on the importance of the Minister of the day retaining, in so far as possible, discretion to pick people for different boards.  There will always be views expressed when people are not in Government, some of which change on entering office, as to what kind of people should be appointed and what those appointments should be.  I take the view that all Governments will experience occasions when people disagree about particular appointments.  As far as many boards are concerned efforts are made to get people with particular skills and interests.In my case, my community background, interest in health and education and pursuit of educational awards brought me to a situation where I was appointed to various boards.  Later, I received a letter from a famous Fianna Fáil Minister whom I shall not identify.  She wrote and told me she appreciated the service I gave to the board and was now going to give somebody else an opportunity to use their skills on behalf of the State.It is fair to state the practices and procedures adopted by the Government follow those adopted by previous Governments.  Through these procedures a strong public sector has evolved which delivers effectively a range of public services.  The House must be mindful of the enormous contribution made by many people.  I hope it will refrain from putting in place procedures that would serve to deter rather than attract people to positions in public bodies.  I am happy to have had an opportunity to make a short contribution on the Bill.  I wish Deputy Boyle well but look forward to supporting the Government at 8.30 p.m.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Appointments to Public Bodies Bill.  It is high time the Oireachtas addresses this area and I compliment the Green Party on bringing the Bill before the Dáil.  Its drafting raises serious technical issues but the Labour Party will support it.The Labour Party introduced the 40% gender quota with regard to State boards.  From my time as Minister of State I recall great difficulties in appointing the best possible board.  Having nominees from particular bodies on a board does not always lead to appointing the best people.  Issues such as worker participation on State boards are a different matter.  I was never convinced of the prudence of having a number of people on boards who were nominees of particular bodies because one sometimes ended up with people who were good at getting themselves elected rather than people one would want.Ministerial discretion, if properly exercised, is important in the context of appointing State boards.  With regard to the gender quota, I recall occasions when we had great difficulty in finding people with the proper qualifications to appoint to boards.  It has become less of an issue in the intervening time.I also remember issues raised when drafting legislation with regard to creating a proper formula to describe the people one wants and avoiding a situation where people who did not have the wherewithal to take up positions could be appointed.  Phrases such as "experience in" and "knowledge of" were used.  This is extremely important in terms of appointing the right board.I wish to input some ideas to the debate and it is difficult to get the lay-out of legislation on this right.  We must ensure openness, transparency and public accountability when making public appointments.  I suggest where appointments to any office, positions of employment or directorships of a public body are proposed to be made by the Government, a Minister or a Minister of State, the Government or Minister should, as soon as possible, lay certain documents before the Oireachtas prior to making an appointment.  I suggest among these documents would be a copy of a proposed contract or a statement in writing of the proposed terms and conditions applicable to the appointment, a statement dealing with the procedures followed for the purpose of making an appointment specifying whether the vacancy was advertised and, if not, why not, whether applications were invited and, if so, from whom and whether competitions or interviews were held.I also suggest including a statement on the selection criteria adopted by the Government or Minister, including any quotas, guidelines or practices relating to the appointment of members of particular groups specifying the qualifications considered necessary or desirable for the appointment.I also suggest that including a statement of the qualifications of the person proposed for the appointment is relevant and a statement of any previous appointments or contract for services made or awarded in respect of that person by the Government, a Minister or a Minister of State is important.  The documents should also include a statement on whether the person proposed for the appointment is or was a connected person to any public representative who is a member of a political party forming the Government or part of it or a member of any such political party, specifying the connection and the political party.With regard to the public bodies we are discussing, a major necessity would be to instruct Oireachtas joint committees that under their orders of reference they may, and where a request is made in writing by no fewer than one third of the members shall, consider and report on any such proposed appointments as it sees fit, shall periodically consider and report upon the general trend of such appointments, may suggest alterations and improvements in procedures for making such appointments and may for those purposes hold hearings and take evidence.It is important to have a full mechanism for accountability such as bodies responsible to the Oireachtas which can take evidence through the committees.  This issue concerns many of us.  The main example is how difficult it is for us as Members of the Dáil to obtain information from the HSE.  We table parliamentary questions which are referred to the political division of the HSE.  Even though procedures are improving and we receive answers more quickly, I find it difficult to accept a scenario where there is no direct accountability to the House and the Minister is not answerable in a particular area.  It is clearly a problem not only with the HSE, other bodies are affected by the same issue.I have outlined procedures that would be well worth exploring.  The ideas include that procedures shall apply to nominations for appointment to any office or position which the Government, a Minister or Minister of State, by virtue of the State's membership of an international body, proposes to make.  Such procedure shall not apply to appointments to membership of the Seanad, appointment of judges, offices of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda Síochána or civil servants.  I suggest this restriction is prudent and wise overall.Essentially, these are ideas I have floated.  Ultimately, the major issue with regard to any of these State bodies is that they serve the purpose for which they are set up and that the membership would be the optimum membership in terms of achieving those goals.The reason the Green Party introduced the Bill and the reason other parties are concerned is to ensure appointments are not made inappropriately, such as to reward political cronies etc.  In these cases there would be very serious questions about the competence of the person being nominated to fill positions.Other practices are operated by these bodies.  For example, some directors or other appointees would have a three-year span, with others having a five-year span or whatever the case may be.  It is clearly important that people do not get dug in, so to speak, and sit for too long on particular bodies when there is a need for fresh thinking.

Sinn Féin welcomes the opportunity to speak on this Bill and commends Deputy Boyle and the Green Party for initiating a debate on the issue.  The question of who is appointed to State boards and how they are selected is very important for society.  The Green Party is right to point out that important decisions affecting the quality of life and services of people are taken by individuals appointed to the boards of these bodies.  Past practices have had detrimental consequences for the semi-State sector in particular.  The process has been dogged by a lack of accountability coupled with political appointees, cronyism and an under-representation of women.The question that can be asked tonight is when was the last time people from a marginalised or disadvantaged background, or minorities such as Travellers, were appointed to State boards.  This has created a scenario that is rife with bad practice.  No party that has served in Government is free from complicity in these practices.As was emphasised during the debate last night, this has seriously undermined public confidence in public bodies in general.  There is still a real, some might say justifiable, perception that public appointments are made on the basis of who knows who and whether a person has connections to whatever parties happen to be in power.  In many cases political appointees have little or no interests in promoting a healthy public sector and in some cases they are opposed to its development.  They may have very little if any relevant experience.  Sinn Féin has long argued for a transparent and accountable appointment process where relevant qualification would be given due consideration.  In many cases we have attempted to enshrine this in legislation before the House.The North has many quangos and political appointees etc., and this will be addressed in the discussions taking place over the next couple of weeks.  If we are to speak about a society based on the principles of equality of opportunity, this quangoism and cronyism must be seen as wrong and should not be allowed.  Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, told the House that the Government considers carefully the attributes of the persons selected in the context of the requirements of the post.  The practices and procedures adopted by the Government follow those adopted by its predecessors.  By telling us the Minister of State follows procedures adopted by his predecessors, he confirms that the process and bad practices of the past persist today.  The Minister of State and the Government seem to be in denial and are unaware of or oblivious to the damaging effect of cronyism on State bodies and public confidence. The proposal in the legislation for a special unit to be attached to the Public Appointments Commission is worth consideration.  The issue regarding the establishment of a joint Oireachtas committee on appointments to public bodies may be better dealt with by existing committees where members would have a better knowledge of the specific State bodies in question.  I would like to hear more discussion on this matter.  It is correct that appointments must be made subject to greater scrutiny by the Dáil in particular.Another serious concern regarding public appointments to State bodies is that many political appointees have a selfish interest in promoting the privatisation of State companies from which they seek to profit.  We should remember Aer Lingus and the actions of its management, which wanted to buy the company.  What about the ongoing problems at An Post and the role its board has played?  Mismanagement at An Post has threatened the future of the post office network and rural post offices in particular.

This is an important debate, but that the matter has appeared on the Order Paper so late in the Dáil is a pity.The legislation's background is the fact that politics have been devalued during the years by broken promises and a lack of trust.  For example, people make a series of promises in an election manifesto or programme for Government, but upon entering office, they cast aside many if not all of their promises immediately and take a different road than indicated.  Politics and politicians have consequently been brought into dispute.I do not disagree with the belief out there concerning cronyism, namely, that Ministers have the opportunity to ensure their friends are appointed to State bodies by way of a reward for being members of the political parties in power rather than on the basis of ability.The legislation is timely and welcome and I will support it in the House.  It is worth referring to the explanatory memorandum, which lays out the Bill's purpose.  It states: "Public bodies are an essential feature of governance in Ireland and important decisions affecting the lives of people are taken by individuals appointed to the boards of these bodies."  Therefore, it is important that the right people — those with ability, the will of the people and a public service ethic — be appointed to the boards.  Gender and age balances have been absent previously and a number of groups that might not be seen as being particularly important in society have been excluded.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	651	It would take a considerable amount of time and effort to analyse the systems that are in place for appointments to public bodies.  Thankfully, that time and effort has been invested by a group called TASC, a think tank for action on social change in Dublin.  In support of the legislation, I will quote from TASC's report, which captures what I want to say.  In 2005, the report identified approximately 5,000 appointments to public bodies at national level, the majority of which were in the gift of Government.  If regional and local levels were included, that number would be significantly greater.  The report stated:Given the number of these appointments and the importance of the function which the appointees must perform, it is a big gap in our accountability structure that Ireland has no clearly established mechanism to ensure that appointments are free from undue political or other influence or that there is an effective independent appointments system in place.  As of now, ministers and senior civil servants are responsible for appointing the majority of members to Public Bodies.  Moreover, the influence of the Oireachtas in the making of these public appointments is negligible...  There is a lack of clarity as to the expertise or experience which might objectively merit such appointments.  Without clear criteria there is the danger of making appointments where the appointee has either mediocre ability or is lacking the appropriate skills and knowledge.It also stated: "There are no effective mechanisms to ensure representation of the diversity of the Irish population: gender balance at 25%, is still short of the 40% guideline established in 1991."  I am quoting, but not selectively.  Had I the time, I would quote the entire report.The report continues:Overall, the present system of appointment to Public Bodies effectively gives elite groups a monopoly of such positions and therefore an inordinate degree of influence on decision making in the State...  The unplanned and ad hoc mushrooming of Public Bodies combined with the lack of good information about them is bad for democracy.  The very existence of these agencies in the ad hoc and fragmented manner in which they have grown up adds a further layer to the bureaucracy of government, constraining an individual citizen’s ability to interact with an agency from which they are seeking a public service.  The case has now been persuasively and repeatedly made for a strategic overview to be taken of Public Bodies, in accordance with clear criteria.I will refer to two final quotes: "It is now more than forty years since the absence of a clear strategy for the establishment of Public Bodies has been identified as a key problem in urgent need of reform".  This is not exactly a rush.  Further, "Given the growing importance of Public Bodies and the influential role of non-elected individuals on important public decisions and actions, this accountability system needs to be extended to create an independent system for these appointments."  The report's gist is clear.It is interesting that the Progressive Democrats Party, which described itself in its founding mission statement as wanting to remove the State from people's lives, has been in government during the years of a proliferation of State bodies.  The Government's accountability has been removed from people's lives.  Indeed, the report, Outsourcing Government, from which I quoted is well named.  I support the legislation.

While I compliment Deputy Boyle on introducing the Bill — I understand he did the spadework in this instance, as he so often does — I caution against the establishment of another quango to do quite a simple job.  I have doubts about the practicality of the Bill's proposal that an Oireachtas committee be set up to vet applicants or nominees for positions in public bodies.  My wonderment is based on my feelings about the current operation of the committee system.  Deputies are stretched to the limit in many cases when trying to cover their committee work and follow proceedings in the Dáil Chamber.  I wonder if the establishment of a committee, the remit of which would be to vet people's qualifications, would be successful.  If one examines the work of the sub-committee which deals with EU directives, one will quickly learn that it does not have enough time to consider issues in detail.  If the proposed appointments committee is established, I suspect similar circumstances will be encountered.  Will this proposal genuinely improve the situation, or has it merely been suggested to improve the optics?While I agree that the process of making appointments to many public bodies needs to be scrutinised, a distinction needs to be made between appointments to An Bord Pleanála, for example, and appointments to prison visiting committees.  It is obvious that decisions made by An Bord Pleanála which was mentioned many times during the debate last night are often of fundamental importance to communities.  The public can only have confidence in the decisions of a body such as An Bord Pleanála if it has confidence in the people making those decisions.  The only way people can have confidence in such decisions is if they are fully aware of the appointments, if they are told why individuals are being appointed, if they are satisfied that appointees have no vested interests, if they are happy that the appointees will act impartially in making decisions and if they are convinced that appointees will act in the common good.  A change in the system of making appointments to public bodies is needed if such a level of confidence is to be achieved.  Despite what I said about the establishment of another Oireachtas committee, it may be appropriate to provide for a committee to vet appointments to bodies such as An Bord Pleanála.  That might be the only democratic way of verifying that the system is transparent and open.  It is not alleged that all appointments made under the present system are suspect.  In many cases, people offer their time and experience for a minimal allowance.

The public bodies which have a combined annual expenditure of €13 billion not only need to be accountable but also need to be seen to be accountable and transparent in the decisions they make.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	655	I welcome the Green Party's decision to raise the issue of the manner of the appointment of individuals to public bodies.  I have often raised this issue in the House during my ten years as a Deputy.The State's system of public appointments is rife with patronage; it is anti-democratic and open to mass abuse.  Fianna Fáil has been a past master in this regard, but only because it is the party which has spent the longest time in government since the foundation of the State.  All the political parties which have spent time in government throughout the history of the State have used their positions, where possible, to promote party members or supporters to the boards of public bodies.  Individuals were appointed to prestigious State boards because they were hacks of the political parties which happened to be in power.  They were not appointed because of any expertise they were able to bring to the position.  Such behaviour constitutes a gross abuse of public bodies, State and semi-State industries, the employees of those industries and taxpayers.Five outgoing Fianna Fáil Ministers stuffed 60 nominees onto a range of State boards after the 2002 general election, before a new Government was put in place.  During last autumn's controversy involving the payment of money to the Taoiseach, it emerged that five of the Taoiseach's 12 friends who assisted him financially had been appointed to important public bodies in the State, including Aer Lingus, the Central Bank, the Dublin Port Authority and Enterprise Ireland.  The Taoiseach let it slip that they had been appointed because they were friends of his.  Such a system is rotten to the core.  There is no question about this.I would like to highlight another key factor which is separate to the cronyism evident in the way State boards have been appointed by Governments and the political parties which have comprised those Governments.  It seems Governments appoint their ideological friends to these positions.  Persons who are in favour of privatisation, for example, are appointed to key positions in public bodies.  When the Government disgracefully moved to privatise Aer Lingus, a crucial public body, were those on the board so committed to public ownership that they were prepared to voice publicly their opposition to the disgraceful proposal?  It was radically opposed by representatives of the workers and the trade unions, as well as many other members of society.I welcome this debate and I am pleased Deputy Boyle has raised this issue.  The Socialist Party would take a more radical approach than that envisaged in this legislation.  The boards of crucial State companies such as Aer Lingus should be democratically elected, rather than appointed.  The board of Aer Lingus, for example, should be elected from among that company's workers who over decades have developed the State and semi-State company in question into a premier service for the people, making enormous sacrifices along the way.  They know inside out how the company and its services operate and how such operations could be greatly improved.  The users of the services of State and semi-State companies should be democratically elected to the boards of such companies.  People who regularly travel on and use the services of Aer Lingus for their work or holiday and personal travel should be allowed to bring their expertise to the board.  This model could be applied to bodies across the spectrum of Irish society, including the health service, which would be transformed if they were opened to the fresh winds of democratic accountability and the democratic election of those who run them, rather than being subject by Government diktat to further layers of bureaucracy at the top.Mar fhocal scoir, cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo, atá curtha ar aghaidh ag an Chomhaontas Ghlas, atá ag iarraidh athchóiriú a dhéanamh ar an bpróiséas ceapacháin chomhaltaí na boird agus chomhlachtaí Stáit, agus postanna speisialta áirithe eile.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I propose to share time with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  This Private Members' Bill proposes new procedures for the appointment of the chair and boards of public bodies and for special appointments to international bodies that are currently at the discretion of the Government.  We do not support the Bill.  The practices and procedures adopted by this Government follow those adopted by previous Governments.  A strong public sector has evolved, delivering a range of services very effectively.  The House must be mindful of the contribution made by such people and refrain from procedures that would deter rather than attract people to positions on public bodies.I listened to the proposals of Deputy Joe Higgins, which smack of McCarthyism.  I can think of several supporters of other political parties and Members of this House who were appointed by this Government and other Governments led by Fianna Fáil and served the State.  One example is the former leader of the Opposition, Mr. Alan Dukes, whom we appointed to head the Agri-Vision committee to examine the agricultural industry up to 2020.  He did an outstanding job.  To say that we only appoint our colleagues is crazy.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	658	The arrangements for the composition of and appointments to the boards of State bodies is usually set out in legislation establishing the bodies.  Normally these appointments are made by the Minister with responsibility for the body, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Ministers must consider the merits of the appointees and ensure they have appropriate skills and experience for the position.  Ministers are answerable to this House for such appointments.  They need flexibility to choose members of State boards.  The range of skills and experience needed for the board of a major commercial State company is significantly different from that of a small regulatory body, of which there are many under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.  There is nothing wrong with the current system and the success of our commercial State bodies supports the view that the boards appointed in the past worked exceedingly well.Deputy Boyle's Bill does not have due regard to the nature of State bodies.  Such bodies report to the Minister who has sectoral responsibility for them.  The joint committees of these Houses have the authority to call in the chairman and top management of each State body.  In most cases such bodies were established by legislation that sets out functions and responsibilities of the Minister and Department.  These include the functions performed by the body, the submission of annual reports and accounts, borrowing, pay and pension matters, recruitment of staff, increases in fees or prices as well as other matters.  Ministers also set out the policy to be followed.  I doubt such people would wish to reply to advertisements and compete for positions.  Such an approach is appropriate for employing people within organisations but not as directors or chairpersons of State bodies, which is fundamentally different from full-time employment.  Tapping the experience of business people has been useful to the public sector, particularly for State companies and advisory groups.  Such groups have advised Governments on policies and strategies.Once a prospective board member accepts the offer of a position, he is subject to a range of legislative guidelines, notably the Ethics Act and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  In October 2001 the Minister for Finance published the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which was formally approved by the Government as binding on all State bodies.  The code stresses the code of conduct for directors and employees.  These should be in written form and a template in the code acts as a guide.  All State bodies must also have an internal audit function or engage external expertise.  The code also refers to procurement and disposal of assets and sets out a framework for best practice, corporate governance of State bodies and principles of quality customer service.Membership of the board of a State body is a demanding role.  The stringent requirements imposed by the Government bring significant responsibilities for all directors and a high degree of accountability.  The Ethics Act, the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Standards in Public Office Act also have implications for directors.  The Ethics Act requires directors of prescribed public bodies to make a declaration of interest to a nominated officer of the body such as the chairperson of the board or a company secretary.The proposed Bill is heavy-handed and bureaucratic.  It would make it difficult to recruit appropriate people to State bodies and advisory groups.  The Bill includes all executive bodies, advisory bodies and task forces.  Up to 600 bodies must be considered by the Oireachtas committee for the purposes of deciding who comes within the remit of the Bill, a considerable task.The role proposed by the Bill for the committee, to review all the procedures in place for the appointment of chairpersons and board members of existing public bodies and to establish a listing of those appointments which should henceforth come under the new procedures set out under the Bill within one year, would impose a complex administrative task on any Oireachtas committee.  No criteria are provided in the Bill to select the bodies that must come within the remit of this Bill.  How will the committee make the decision?  What is an appropriate body to which this Bill should apply?The procedures set out in Deputy Boyle's Bill would involve the establishment of a public appointments unit in the office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the advertising of all public appointments and the holding of public recruitment competitions for all positions.  In addition, the appointments would be ratified by a joint Oireachtas committee.  These procedures are disproportionate and unwieldy and likely to deter rather than attract suitable persons.  Sections 17 and 18 deal with the dismissal of a chairman or board member.  Provisions dealing with dismissal suggest a lack of understanding of the public service ethos on which we rely when filling the positions on boards of public bodies.The current arrangements for appointments to State bodies are workable, practicable and help recruit people from whom the entire public service benefits.  There is no reason to discourage energetic, dedicated people with a proven track record from being appointed to State bodies by the Government of the day.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I am not convinced of the need for the Bill.  The current system for appointing people to State bodies has been in existence for a long time.  It has worked well.  Governments of various hues have tapped into the advice and experience of experts, business people and professionals, which has informed Government and helped to make progress.  The Bill is drafted to include State bodies, boards, advisory groups and other agencies.  Much of the comment has focused on board members of State bodies.Many people who have successful careers in non-public work will not apply to be interviewed and vetted as proposed by this Bill.  Busy people who, when approached by Government to do some public service, may respond positively when offered a position on an advisory group or State body but would be unlikely to push forward to seek positions.  State companies have progressed over the years in part because of the boards that oversee development.  Other groups have advised Governments on economic and social policy and have contributed in this way.  I see no reason to change to a cumbersome and bureaucratic system.  The system is not perfect but Deputy Boyle's proposals would not lead to a better system.My ministerial colleague, Deputy Parlon, set out the reasons we oppose the Bill, the purpose of which is not clear.  Where is the value added?  The Deputy referred to a crisis of confidence in our State bodies but I have not detected it.

I have been Minister for Health, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance.  On all of the board appointments I make I seek to appoint competent people.  I do not regard political party membership as a precondition for eligibility, but neither do I regard it as a disbarment.  That is a fair and honest assessment of the situation.  This politically correct culture which espouses that to be a member of a political party is potentially a subversive activity, prohibiting one from meeting the required standards set down by State-sponsored bodies is a non-runner.  I am sorry but the evidence is not with the Deputies opposite on this.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	673	——on many occasions.  The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 requires the directors of prescribed public bodies to provide annual statements of interests to a nominated officer of the body concerned such as a chairperson of the board or the company secretary.  The statements of interest must also be given to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The type of interests that are to be disclosed include details of occupation, shares, other directorships, land, travel or accommodation services provided at less than the commercial price, public service contracts, gifts etc.  Directors may also voluntarily disclose other interests not listed in the legislation.  If a director needs to carry out a task and discovers he or she has a material interest in it, he or she must inform the other directors.  A director must not perform such a task unless there are compelling reasons to do so, and in the event, he or she must inform both the other directors and the Standards in Public Office Commission as regards the compelling reasons.I remind Deputes that the code of practice for the governance of State bodies also seeks to ensure that all State bodies are governed to the best possible extent in line with best practice.  The purpose of the code is to provide a governance framework within which the internal management and internal and external reporting of relationships of State bodies is to take place.  The framework within which boards must operate is set by the code.  It provides board members with the way in which to measure their actions.Deputy Gogarty referred to instances where former employees take up work after leaving the public service.  I am not sure how this Bill would affect employees.  However, there are procedures in place both in the Civil Service and the local authority area regarding the acceptance of outside appointments and consultancy engagements following resignation or retirement.  In the Civil Service the code of standards and behaviour provides that a civil servant should not accept an appointment or particular consultancy project where he or she believes the nature and terms of such an appointment could lead to a conflict of interest or the perception of such, without first obtaining the approval of the outside appointments board established under the code, or of the Secretary General or head of office, as appropriate.  Additionally, civil servants who hold positions which are designated posts for the purpose of the Ethics in Public Office Acts must, within 12 months of resigning or retiring, obtain the approval of the outside appointments board or the Secretary General or head of office, as appropriate, before taking up any outside appointment.  Similar provisions now apply in the local authority area.Deputy Sargent spoke about the composition of school boards of management.  This proposed Bill would not affect such boards.  Boards of management are put in place in line with the legislation and are not appointed by the State.  Deputy Eamon Ryan referred to pension entitlements of board members.  I am not sure what he is referring to here since, in general, it is only the chief executive officer and staff of boards who hold pensionable positions.I welcome the point made by Deputy Paul McGrath.  It is one I have mentioned already, to the effect that some people with great experience will be unwilling to apply for posts, but might agree to a request from Government to serve.  Any system must not be such so as to deprive people of the opportunity to use their experience for the good of the country.In conclusion, I reiterate that the current system has worked well.  It is an appropriate system for appointments to various State groups.  This system allows us to benefit from the wide experience of people and allows them to do valuable public service.  If there are instances under this system where that has not happened, there are accountability mechanisms that can ensure no reappointment.  If there is a clear issue where people are not competent in a particular area, their unsuitability will become obvious fairly quickly.  It is in line with the tradition of citizens’ and public service in terms of the appointments system as it exists.  This Bill would not enhance matters.  Instead, it would reduce the attractiveness of taking up public service and make it difficult to draw on the necessary experience and expertise that has been available to Governments in the past.

I commend Deputy Boyle for drafting this legislation.  Two of my colleagues won awards this evening for best politician and best TD, Deputies Sargent and Eamon Ryan.  Deputy Boyle deserved to get something, but perhaps next year when he is serving in Government he will get an award.I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I listened earlier, briefly, to Deputy O'Connor.  He is a fine guy and I get on with him, but he said something which caught my attention, namely, that he was appointed to various boards simply because he was an active member of the community.  I am sure he is a very active member of the community and he reminds the House all the time what he does for Tallaght.  However, I believe that is not the only reason he was appointed.  His links to Fianna Fáil were another very good reason for his appointments to boards.  It is clear that board appointments are regarded as the spoils of war after an election.I know this from my experience on Dublin City Council when the Green Party had the opportunity to be a minor player at local government level when we formed a coalition with Fine Gael, the Labour Party and independent councillors.  We had the opportunity then to select people for board membership and we did that.  The point that has been made here is relevant.  We discovered that it sometimes was difficult to get people, particularly when the position was not remunerated.  However, if a position is paid well, many people would like such a placement and while the Minister might say that at all times he acted in the public interest, if he is to be absolutely honest, I am sure he knows of people on boards and wondered why, in God's name, they were appointed.  Too often the reason for such appointments is that they know someone.That is the difficultly.  As a result of that, as I have discussed with many colleagues in Opposition, Fianna Fáil has this wonderful network throughout the country of people it has appointed.  Even when it is out of Government and in Opposition, it has key people all over the place.  It has this very powerful network at all levels of the community.  It never ceases to amaze me when fine people pop up and then at election time one sees them canvassing with Fianna Fáil.  I am not saying——

At our press conference I mentioned the example of the UK, from which we could learn.  I know of people there, with no party political affiliations, who have been appointed on merit alone and because they fulfil certain criteria.  That is the example we need to follow.  It is not about getting bogged down in bureaucracy but about fairness and merit and, as a result, making our society more effective.

There are still too many village chieftains in politics.  There are too many pork barrel politicians who dispense the spoils of office to those who have helped them along the way.

I admit yesterday I was discouraged on hearing the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon.  He represents the junior partner in the Government, a party which set out to break the mould in politics but has ended up supping from the bowl more deeply than any other party.  The gist of his contribution was that everything was all right.  It was obvious from his contribution that matters are not all right.The members of the boards of over 600 State and public bodies are appointed by ministerial diktat.  They come to 6,000 people.  Since 1980 the increase has been tenfold.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has appointed close on 2,000 people to State boards; the Department of Health and Children, 1,400 people; yet, we are to take this for granted as good public governance.  It is not.On the day the Taoiseach wrapped himself in the cloak of respectability with the launch of the report of the task force on active citizenship——

The first action must be to recognise 600 public and State bodies and 6,000 appointments need to be rationalised.  The Green Party's proposed public appointments unit would have this as its first task.  An appointments procedure must be open, transparent and encourage public confidence.  The current system does not do this.I accept the majority of State appointees are people who are civic-minded.  Many of them, however, are also appointed on the basis of who they are and where they come from.

The point of a Second Stage debate is to accept the concept of a Bill and to let it proceed to Committee Stage, on which amendments can be accepted that will improve the Bill.  We propose that ministerial responsibility in this regard should be maintained and it can be further enhanced by the Minister accepting a number of nominations from, what we propose to be, the commission on public appointments and the ultimate selection can be made subsequently, which would be ratified by either a specified Oireachtas committee or an existing committee.  That could be teased out on Committee Stage.I take issue with the point that proposing two methods of assessment and ratification is an over-bureaucratisation of the process.  Hundreds of items of legislation govern our systems of public appointments and the approach to it is overly bureaucratic.  Our proposals would simplify the system, which is badly in need of simplification.As regards the notion of people being too exalted in our Republic to be asked to account for themselves in terms of being servants on public bodies, the system could be modified in the sense that people could directly apply by public advertisement or the public advertisement could be phrased in such a way that people could be nominated by the public advertisement to go to the bodies that we propose for their assessment.  What we propose is an open system such as that which exists in other jurisdictions.  The Minister may not like it now or for the eight weeks remaining of the 29th Dáil but he will have to think hard about this because whatever government replaces the current Government on the benches opposite——

He attended his son's wedding last weekend without having been fitted with a digital hearing aid.  The HSE informed me on 1 December 2006 that it would be commencing the process of supplying digital hearing aids in early 2007.  It is now one third of the way through 2007 and the digital hearing aids are only being supplied to children.I accept this was the initial plan and I have no difficulty with prioritising children but I have a difficulty with the slow pace of delivery which extends to a year and a half for this gentleman.  He has endured a poor quality of life because of his poor hearing.  All he is asking for is a digital hearing aid.  These appliances cost in the region of €1,300.  I ask for a commitment from the Minister on the timescale within which those already assessed will be supplied with their hearing aids.  This is a simple request and not something one would imagine would need to be raised on the floor of Dáil Éireann.  However, because of the lack of response to date I had no other choice but to do so.  I ask the Minister for a firm commitment as to when the people who have applied will receive their appliances.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	747	I thank Deputy Enright for allowing me the opportunity to raise the same matter concerning a number of my constituents, particularly one in south Galway.  This elderly man had an analogue hearing aid which did not suit him as is the case for many people.  He has a medical card and is on a very low income.  He tried to better himself by acquiring an attachment for the analogue hearing aid which makes it a half-digital system.  The hearing aid is relatively good but it is extremely uncomfortable and is inconvenient.  I wish to make a special case for the many hundreds of people at this stage in their lives.  Thankfully, I do not have a problem with my hearing.  However, I imagine that it is a great drawback to have a hearing impairment.  As Deputy Enright stated, quality of life is a matter of major importance to the people to whom she referred.  We should at the very least provide digital hearing aids for those who are on low incomes and who are also on medical cards.  I understand that the technology is so good that the units are becoming less expensive.  I cannot understand why the HSE is not in a position to deliver the type of equipment which can be life changing for many people.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	748	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.As the House will be aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which duly came into being on 1 January 2005.  Under the Act, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or to arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes the delivery of audiology services and the prioritising and resourcing of the development of national community audiology services is now a matter for the HSE.  Nonetheless, I am happy to set out the position as regards this matter, as well as to convey the information provided by the HSE on the specific questions asked by the Deputies.The national community audiology service provides free audiology services for all children, irrespective of their parents' means, and for adults who have eligibility.  For an adult to be eligible, he or she must be in possession of a current medical card.  The service held 4,822 clinics in 2006 and 39,432 patients were seen.  A figure of €1,663,430 was spent nationally on hearing aids and accessories in 2006.Until the end of last year, all hearing aids fitted by the national community audiology service were of the analogue type.  However, since the beginning of 2007, the HSE, as part of the modernisation of the service, has started the roll-out of the provision of digital hearing aids for children up to the age of 18 years.  The reason for this was the impact of hearing loss on children's education.As Deputy Enright said, everyone would agree that if we are going to focus resources, they should be focused in this direction.  At present, the HSE does not provide digital hearing aids for adults over the age of 18 years.  However, it is examining the costs involved in providing digital hearing aids to adults.  In addition, it hopes to establish a national review of audiology services to explore the delivery of such services in the most appropriate setting.Meanwhile, the HSE has worked to ensure national standardisation of approaches to waiting lists and waiting times using a standardised template.  Data according to this revised template is due to be reported at the end of the first quarter 2007.A further imperative is to develop integrated working for those with hearing loss at primary care level between audiologists, general practitioners, speech and language therapists, public health nurses, etc.  The HSE also envisages the development of audiology services that will be fully integrated between acute hospitals and community services and delivered in the most appropriate setting.The Department of Health and Children is committed to the continued development of community audiology services.  I will ensure that the comments of both Deputies are brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.

Earlier today, Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I tabled motions under Standing Order 31 requesting the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss this extremely important issue relating to the well-being and health of people in Galway.  It would have been far more satisfactory if we had engaged in a debate under Standing Order 31 with the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, rather than dealing with the matter via this set-piece debate on the Adjournment.  We had no other option but to raise the matter on the Adjournment when our motions under Standing Order 31 were refused.  I have every confidence in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but he will read from a prepared script that will be relevant to the subject but will not provide answers in respect of some of the questions Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I intend to pose.The Minister is aware that the waters of the Corrib are seriously polluted and, as a result, 90,000 people in Galway city, Oughterard, Killannin, Moycullen, Oranmore, Maree, Derrydonnell, Athenry, Corrandulla, Annaghdown, Headford, Tuam and elsewhere have been affected.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs gave an interview in respect of this matter earlier this evening on national radio and he appeared to indicate that €21 million has been available since 2002 for water treatment works in Galway city and county.  He more or less laid the blame at the door of local authorities for not taking up the offer of this money.  Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, indicate why that €21 million was not spent in Galway, where the water supplies of city and half the county are sourced from the 60,000 acre Lough Corrib, which has been seriously polluted with the cryptosporidium virus?It is no wonder that the Corrib is polluted, particularly as a result of the Government's failure to provide sewage treatment plants and sewerage schemes in towns and villages which surround it such as Headford, Claregalway, Oughterard, Cornamona and Clonbur.  The Government neglected its duty by not providing the necessary infrastructure to which I refer.  We have been warning about the danger of pollution in the Corrib for many years.There appears to be an attitude that this problem in Galway should be hushed up.  It is a serious problem and well over 100 people were identified as having contracted the virus and several were hospitalised.  However, several hundred more people, whose immune systems were better able to combat the infection, were also affected.  The virus is extremely dangerous for the elderly, the young and people who are receiving chemotherapy.  People who live in the affected area cannot touch the water, drink it, use ice cubes made from it or brush their teeth.  The Government's attitude appears to be that the matter should be played down.Deputy Paul McGrath tabled a parliamentary question earlier today in which he asked the Minister for Health and Children the number of deaths that have occurred over the past ten years from the presence of cryptosporidium in public water supplies, and the groups vulnerable to serious injury or death from this organism.  The Minister replied to the question but did not provide any information about the number of deaths.  From my research, I am aware that a number of deaths have resulted from people being infected with this virus in recent years.Why is it not possible to face up to the fact that we are faced with a serious crisis?  Will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outline the steps being taking in Galway to put in place the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the filtration and treatment of drinking water of the population of Galway city and the surrounding area?  This problem will not go away by itself, particularly since it has been established that the Corrib is polluted.  What steps is the Department taking to ensure the problem in the affected area, in which I live, will be remedied as soon as possible in order that proper water supplies will be restored to the people who reside there?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	750	I thank the two Deputies who raised this matter.  Deputy McCormack asked a specific question and I will cut to the details of that because he is entitled to specifics.The presence of cryptosporidium was confirmed on 20 March, as Deputy McCormack knows.  It was found to be involved at the old Terryland plant, which is part of the Galway city water supply.  That was confirmed by further research the following day.  I understand that there is no cryptosporidium to be found in the Galway council's second and more modern plant at Terryland.Deputy McCormack asked me specifically to clarify the position on funding.  I am pleased to confirm that the funding has been in place for a number of years but that the Galway council still has to prepare the brief to draw down that funding.Inadequate filtration capacity at the old treatment plant in Terryland is at the centre of the problem in Galway city.  Funding has been in place for some considerable time, under my Department's water services investment programme.  As Deputy McCormack acknowledged, the funding is in the sum of €21.5 million.  That money is intended to upgrade the plant and will minimise future risk of cryptosporidium entering the supply.  I understand that Galway City Council will submit a brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for this scheme to my Department as soon as possible.As Deputy McCormack stated, the current difficulty for the people in Galway is an extremely serious matter.  One of the basic and fundamental supplies which our local authorities are responsible for providing is clean water and it is astonishing that €21.5 million has been available to carry out services, with which, as Deputy McCormack suggests, it has been known in this area for some time that there were problems.  I cannot understand why the brief has not been prepared and I have asked for an explanation of that.  I have indicated to my Department that the brief, as soon as it is submitted, receive immediate attention and clearance in the Department.I hope this latest incident will prompt the council in this case to show urgency in the matter and will certainly prompt local council members to show more focus and ambition on the issue.  After all, that is what the people of Galway city and Galway council have elected their councillors to do.  Deputy McCormack might like to inquire locally as to precisely why there has been such lethargy on the issue.  My Department has spoken to the council and I am convinced that it is working hard on the issue.I also understand from the contacts that have been made with the city council that it is putting temporary filtration facilities in place until the upgrade of the Terryland plant is complete and will produce a report on the available options later this week.  As soon as that report comes to my Department it will receive attention.  I wholeheartedly support the idea and my Department will assist the council in any way it can.  Moreover, we will look positively on and support any proposals from the council for advance works on the €21.5 million permanent scheme.Deputy McCormack mentioned other schemes in the area and I will advert to two of them.  The Headford water supply scheme is a small stand-alone scheme using raw water from Lough Corrib with disinfection only.  A €29 million extension to the Tuam regional water scheme to Headford, which is also funded by my Department, is under construction and commissioning is expected to take place in August next.  In the meantime, I understand that Galway County Council has secured an alternative supply, which could be in place within a week or so, from the Caherlistrane-Kilcoona group water scheme, which itself has had a €4 million treatment plant installed last month with funding from my Department.  It is simply untruthful to suggest that funding is not being provided by the Government.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The funding is in place now.  As I stated, the council in Deputy McCormack's area has had €21.5 million available to it to do this work.  I realise he is not a member of the council, but local inquiries should be made as to why that was not spent.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I was a member.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I am sure Deputy McCormack would have been much more active in this matter than certain current councillors, who preach about the green agenda but do not practise it when they are in power in their local council.  I have clarified that funding of €21.5 million has been in place for some time for the Terryland upgrade and I look forward to the council coming forward with the proposals.Returning to the first point, I agree with Deputy McCormack — I also spoke privately to Deputy Michael D. Higgins who is not in the Chamber but who I am sure has been inadvertently detained — that it is wrong that 90,000 people should be without water.  It is doubly wrong when 90,000 in an important city and surrounding area are without water when the funding is in place.  Deputy McCormack and other public representatives in the area and, more importantly, the people of Galway, are entitled to an explanation for that.I give Deputy McCormack and this House an assurance that I will do everything in my power to ensure that as soon as the brief comes up, it will not stay for a moment longer than required in my Department.  I have also stated that I made clear to my Department that I want it to be helpful and to assist Galway through this great difficulty, particularly given the time of year.  As Deputy McCormack stated, it is not just an inconvenience but is a threat to public health and to life itself.  That is not acceptable, particularly when local councils have funding available to them.  Deputy McCormack can assure his constituents, as I have assured all the other public representatives in the area, that I will encourage the council to be ambitious and will encourage my Department to co-operate fully with Galway to bring this matter to an end.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I particularly highlight the area of rural roads in north-west Kildare.  Clearly, there has been tremendous pressure on many of these roads because they are being used by vehicles which are too large for them.  Indeed, many gravel pits and the like have contributed to the damage.  However, significant budgetary constraints are experienced by Kildare County Council as a direct result of the population growth.  Although it may well have escaped notice, Kildare is the fourth most populous county, behind Dublin, Cork and Galway.  It has overtaken Limerick.  Kildare now has a large population, with all the related demands placed on it.  Obviously, the stresses and strains are being seen in areas such as roads.Kildare County Council carried out a dilapidation survey of roads in north-west Kildare which were west of the R402, the Enfield-Edenderry road.  Subsections of the road were categorised as very poor, poor, fair, good or very good, and good was identified as a road with good visibility which was free of potholes for at least 1 km or which had no more than ten repaired potholes per 1 km.  The council then carried out a costing exercise to calculate the cost of bringing the road up to a good standard.  The cost per square metre was based on the historical knowledge, VAT etc.  Kildare County Council concluded that bringing up to good condition the 230,000 sq m of road that need to be addressed would cost €2.83 million, but it has allocated €300,000 for this year which is significantly short of what is needed.Over the winter some of the bus services for school children were not provided because the roads were inadequate.  Some of the roads have crumbled at each side and are not even capable of taking cars in both directions simultaneously.Kildare motorists paid €35 million in motor tax last year into the local government fund, for which it is ring-fenced, and the local authorities in Kildare received €27 million back.  I, therefore, reckon that Kildare is the biggest net contributor to that fund.Taking the local government fund and the commercial rates together, the two counties with the lowest spend per head of population were Meath and Kildare, respectively.  While within those counties the widespread perception is that the money must be spent in Naas, Newbridge or elsewhere, it is the inadequacy of resources that is the problem.  By not spending enough, there is a degree of wastage by repairing roads rather than doing a proper job.Some years ago the former Minister, Pádraig Flynn, declared a war on potholes and I want the Minister, Deputy Roche, to declare a war on potholes in north-west Kildare.  I have a copy of the photographs concerned to hand and if the Minister saw them, he would agree this is not acceptable in a country that is as well off as we are.  With regard to transport, a state-of-the art highway was constructed not far from this part of County Kildare by a public private partnership which is not used by everyone because these people face difficulties in accessing it.  They feel like the forgotten people.  I would like to give the Minister a copy of the photographs and I invite him to meet these people because I am sure they would welcome him if he came to see first-hand the difficult circumstances they are experiencing, although he would be shocked by the condition of the roads.  I hope he will not tell me how many millions have been allocated to County Kildare or how well-off the county is because that is a myth.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	756	I hope not to disappoint the Deputy but I intend to outline the extraordinary resources currently available to Kildare County Council, not only from Exchequer funds but also due to the development contributions taken in by the council in recent years and the buoyancy of its rates.  If any local authority should be facing difficulties in this area, it is not Kildare County Council.I have significantly increased the allocation to non-national roads this year, with €947 million coming from the local government fund.  General purpose grants from my Department have also been significantly increased to meet the gap between the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  The amount I am providing this year represents an increase of 8% over the amount provided in 2006.  In the case of Kildare County Council, I have provided €26.48 million in general purpose grants in 2007, or three times the amount received in 1997.  This represents an increase of 10.8% on 2006.  The Deputy will accept the allocation is ahead of the rate of inflation.  If any small or medium business in County Kildare was able to guarantee an 11% increase in its bottom line revenues, it would be very happy.The provision, maintenance and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities to fund from their own resources, supplemented by grants provided by my Department.  In 2007, the grant allocation by my Department to Kildare County Council for improvement and maintenance works on non-national roads is €23.53 million, while the municipalities in the area received additional funding.  This is three and a half times the funding provided in 1997 and seven and a half times the provision in 1994.  Over the same period, Kildare County Council's own resources have fluctuated dramatically.  One of the problems for the county may be an eccentric voting pattern by councillors with regard to funding.  The figures available on my Department's website reveal some extraordinary variations.  The council's resources were €4.1 million in 2001 and €1.6 million in 2002, and subsequently increased to €7.4 million and €7.6 million.  I commend the council on its recent allocations, which have amounted to €10 million over the past two years.  Like many other local authorities, the increased investment in non-national roads being made by Kildare County Council from its own resources is not keeping pace with the increases in those resources.The Deputy has a lot of experience as a councillor, so she will be aware that rate income in County Kildare has doubled over a six-year period.  Development contributions have increased even more spectacularly, from €6.4 million in 2000 to €27.4 million in 2005.  I understand the estimate for development contribution income was over €37.3 million last year, or a 50% increase in one year alone.  Any council receiving those sums has no excuse for potholes.  That money is intended for a variety of purposes, including public lighting, roads and pavements, rather than being simply lodged in the bank.  Development contributions are specifically designed to ensure developers play their part in upgrading local infrastructure.  The Deputy is correct that there has been a significant increase in commercial and construction traffic in County Kildare, with punishing implications for roads.  However, that traffic has also produced the 50% increase in development levies.  I am not sure whether any other local authority achieved such an increase.The raising of development contributions and the policy principles for expenditure are matters for local councillors but community gain should be a primary consideration.  If the Deputy has concerns about how resources are being expended, she should raise them with her local councillors.  I find it strange that the council has informed her it does not have the resources to carry out a comprehensive audit of roadworks for the county.  I do not understand how a local authority representing a county which has experienced such a phenomenal increase in development levies could make such an excuse to a public representative.The Exchequer is also providing significantly increased funding to local authorities towards infrastructure provision in other areas, such as national roads, housing and water services.  In the past decade, the substantial level of resources provided to local authorities through central funding and the fruits of economic success resulted in a trebling of local authority expenditure.  Every local authority in the country is experiencing increases in population, although these increases are higher in some areas than others.  When I establish general purpose allocations, I consider non-national road grants, increased rates income and the resources now flowing into local authority coffers from development contributions.This argument is too often made by local authorities.  I believe there is insufficient ambition among elected council representatives to perform thorough audits of how funding is being spent.  The Deputy may agree with me on that issue.  It is the reason I have proposed establishing internal audit procedures in every local authority.  Good quality external auditing experience would give elected members the ammunition to ensure more ambition, efficiency and delivery at local level.  I am familiar with the potholes in County Kildare, some of which are herculean in size.  However, lack of funds is not a reason for the lack of attention given to these potholes.  Funding is being provided but it needs to be used properly.

Following a protracted public private partnership process, I am hopeful that contractual arrangements with the preferred tenderer will be completed over the coming weeks, leading to the delivery of the conference centre some 40 months later.  The Product Development and Infrastructure sub-programme of the National Development Plan 2007 –13, includes provision for the PPP funded capital cost of this project which, when fully operational, is expected to generate additional foreign revenue earnings of between €25m and €50m per year.Neither my Department, nor I understand Failte Ireland, has undertaken any specific research into the feasibility of providing a conference centre in the Shannon area on a public private partnership basis.  I am, however, aware of a proposal by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation for the development of a major Regional Conference Centre at Shannon/ Limerick, which was included in their submission to the Department of Finance on the National Development Plan.Given the current priority to ensure the successful delivery of the National Conference Centre, it may be premature at this time to embark on a publicly-funded feasibility study for additional major conference facilities, although the issue will remain under review in the light of emerging demand for conference-related tourism business.

However, no transfer of capital funding for the project occurred. Capital funding is not currently available to me to progress the development of an Irish Academy for the Performing Arts.It should be borne in mind that in 2003 the Government initiated its first educational Public Private Partnership in the form of its €58.4m investment in the Cork School of Music, part of the Cork Institute of Technology, which has facilitated its development as "a centre of musical excellence locally, regionally, nationally and internationally".
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 192 together.As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, the nationwide audit of sports facilities has commenced and is being carried out in stages to help speed up the availability of information. Phase One is being carried out within my Department and will establish a record of national and regional sports facilities.The work currently being undertaken is a data gathering exercise in conjunction with the main sporting bodies and local authorities to identify the facilities for inclusion in this phase. My Department has compiled a list in excess of one hundred sports facilities of national or regional significance.  Many of these have been funded under the Sports Capital Programme since 1999 and a considerable bank of information already exists, although some of this information is not up to date and therefore an updating of data is being undertaken.  Furthermore, details of facilities at third level educational institutions and swimming pools have also been included on this inventory. Further engagement with the main sporting bodies, local authorities, facility owners and managers is being undertaken so that a comprehensive database on the range and nature of sporting facilities at national and regional level can be completed.As stated previously, the enormity of completing the complete audit of sports facilities should not be underestimated and, given the experience of other countries, is likely to take a number of years to complete.The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to put in place a national sports facility strategy that will identify gaps in facility provision and set out an approach to fill these gaps.  A Steering Group has been appointed and consultants have been engaged by my Department to assist in the preparation of the Strategy. It is envisaged that the Strategy will be completed by the summer.  The overall aim of the Strategy is to identify the facilities needed for any given sport so that, insofar as is feasible and reasonable, all those who want to participate in sport can do so within a reasonable distance of their home or base, and at reasonable cost.One of the key outputs from the Strategy will be a definition of an appropriate level of sports facility provision, based on relevant international experience and practice, the Department's policy objectives in this area, and Irish circumstances and conditions. The outcome of this exercise should describe the mix and level of facilities that should be aspired to at national level (including meeting our high performance needs) at our main cities; at smaller but regionally-important urban centres; and at a later stage, at local level.  This element of the strategy will greatly help in the completion of the audit.By ascertaining and mapping what is already in place at a national and regional level, an important part of developing a strategic approach to future facility provision will be put in place, as well as establishing the level of need that exists in the sports sector and helping to determine future priorities.At the request of the London 2012 Task force, the Department is also undertaking a separate limited London 2012 sports infrastructural audit.  This will establish a list of facilities that are likely to attract Olympic and Paralympic training camps prior to London 2012.  The audit will focus on universities and national sports-specific facilities.

Their impressive performances against Zimbabwe and in particular, Pakistan has deservedly earned them a place in the coveted Super Eight of the World Cup. Their success has played a major role in raising the profile of cricket in Ireland.   I congratulate the manager Adrian Birell and his captain Trent Johnston and wish them every success for the Super Eight stage of the competition.Since 1999, the Government has provided over €1 million in funding, through the Irish Sports Council (ISC), to the Irish Cricket Union which is the National Governing Body for cricket.  Included in this figure is the sum of €17,000 allocated in 2005 for the International Cricket Council (ICC) Trophy, a qualifying tournament which was held in Ireland and through which the Irish team actually qualified for the World Cup at which they are currently excelling.  Also included is €242,010 granted between 2006 and 2007 for the Cricket World Cup preparations.Funding to cricket from the ISC has been complemented by funding from my Department for facilities and equipment under the Sports Capital Programme. Since 2000, funding has been provided under the programme towards the improvement of the facilities at cricket's venue for hosting international matches, the Clontarf Cricket Club, and for the establishment of the national Centre of Excellence for the sport, at North County Cricket Club in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin.In addition, in consultation with the ISC and the Irish Cricket Union, a special provision of €254,000 was made available to improve the facilities of a number of cricket clubs for the hosting of the ICC Trophy.   In all, a total of  €1.25 million has been allocated under the Sports Capital Programme in the period 2000-2006.I look forward to continuing success for this outstanding Irish team in the major challenges facing them in the Super Eight stage of the World Cup and to an enduring legacy for the promotion and development of cricket in Ireland in the years to come.  I intend to mark their historic achievement in a suitable manner at an appropriate time.

At the same time, the Government agreed to hold an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre.The OPW is currently finalising the preparation for the design competition.  A competition of this nature is a very complex one and takes time to perfect.  The technical documentation must be very carefully specified and a design jury set up to select the winning design.  I am sure the Deputy would agree, given the significance of this project, that time and care is vital in planning it.  The Government is committed to providing a National Theatre of world class and this is not a process which can be rushed.  Once the winning design has been selected the building will be procured on a BFM Public Private Partnership basis.  It is expected that the planning and procurement arrangements will take a further 12 months to finalise and the building will take 18 months to complete.Given the timescale involved in procuring a new National Theatre, the National Theatre is expected to remain in situ for some time yet.   Much of the equipment at the Abbey has become obsolete and age worn.  The works being carried out are essential from a customer service and a health and safety perspective and I am satisfied that the works are necessary.    The Abbey Theatre Board is independent of me in decisions of this nature.  I understand in any event that the seating installation is modular; it can be reassembled elsewhere, if necessary.  Just because the Abbey is due to be relocated is not sufficient reason to allow our National Theatre to fall into disrepair.

This has been explicitly recognised by the Government which is providing over 6 billion euro for Science Technology and Innovation under the Enterprise, Science and Innovation Priority of the National Development Plan. It is the goal of the strategy that Irish business should, over the life of the NDP, become renowned for the excellence of its research and at the forefront of generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture.There has been a high level of innovation in tourism policy in recent years with the complete overhaul of the institutional arrangements for the implementation of policy, the Report of the Tourism Policy Review Group and the development of a range of programmes and initiatives in product development, marketing and training. Last month I launched Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Product Development Strategy for the period 2007-2013. The strategy is a framework to guide public and private investment in tourism over the next seven years.  The Tourism Product Development Review Group recommends the setting up of a National Centre for Innovation in Tourism that will fund ongoing applied research, support innovation and entrepreneurship in tourism SMEs, and embed a culture of innovation in the tourism industry.As part of a phased implementation of the new product development strategy, Fáilte Ireland is considering this recommendation and is undertaking a preliminary examination of the proposal, taking into account the activities and operations of a number of other relevant bodies and educational institutions already working in this area. In this regard it is important that any proposed National Centre for Innovation is seen to add value and avoid overlap or duplication with established agencies elsewhere.

The Programme provides for a maximum grant of €3.8million.  Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the local authority.  Before supporting such a project, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project when completed, would have a suitable level of public access.  Consequently, the question of the location or operation of public swimming pools in any particular area is a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authority.Under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which closed to applicants on 31st July, 2000, the following projects in the Dublin area have been or are being dealt with:Pool ProjectStatusFunding allocated€mFinglas (replacement pool)Completed3.8Ballymun (replacement pool)Completed3.8Ballyfermot (replacement pool)Under construction3.8Jobstown (new)Completed3.8Clondalkin (replacement)Under construction3.8St. Michael’s House (new)Under construction3.7Skerries (new)Preparing contract documents*Glenalbyn (refurbishment)Preparing contract documents*Dundrum (replacement)Preparing tender documents*St. Joseph’s School for Deaf Boys (refurbishment)Preparing preliminary report**Grant aid is formally allocated at the stage when the tender for the project is approved.The priority under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme is to continue to support those projects remaining within the programme.  Of the 57 projects with the current round, 23 have been completed, 18 are under construction or about to start construction, 3 are out to tender and the remaining 13 are at various stages in the process.My Department is completing an Expenditure Review of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme at present.  The Review is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The Review is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the review it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities, including Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to submit applications under the terms that will apply.

The specifications for the stadium is that it would be capable of hosting soccer fixtures and that it would provide capacity for 6,000 seated spectators and this capacity is provided for under the planning approval.  In supporting the provision of a soccer stadium at Tallaght, I am seeking to bring to completion a long-standing plan for a soccer stadium on this site and to fulfil the Government's undertaking to provide soccer facilities.Under the Sports Capital Programme, my Department allocated funding of €2.57m towards this project over the 3 years 2000 to 2002. €2.44m has already been provided to Shamrock Rovers Stadium Development Committee based on work, carried out prior to the end of 2002.  The FAI via Shamrock Rovers FC provided €457,000 towards this stage of the project.It is my understanding that, to accommodate a full size senior GAA pitch in the available space and taking into account the works already completed on the site, significant changes would have to be made to the existing plans, which would impact on the approved capacity for the stadium, cause further delays and increase costs.I have discussed the matter with the GAA at both national and Dublin County Board level on a number of occasions and my Department has had meetings with senior officials of the South Dublin County Council, the FAI and the GAA in seeking to progress the project.  I am deeply disappointed at the continuing impediment that is delaying this project and which could have serious additional cost implications for its development.I have no problem with the principle of Tallaght stadium  being made available to other codes, including GAA , once the stadium is completed to soccer specifications and the Government commitment to the FAI and Shamrock Rovers can be honoured. I hope that South Dublin County Council will soon be in a position to make progress and complete this stadium in a timely and cost effective manner.

The strategy was drawn up by an expert Review group, representing a cross section of tourism interests from both the public and private sectors. In preparing its recommendations, the group undertook a comprehensive analysis of international trends and of the responses of our competitors; it examined product opportunities; and it undertook a very detailed assessment of the quality and the relevance of the Irish tourism product offering, including its ‘fitness for purpose', in today's volatile marketplace.The Review group carried out a national tourism product audit to assess the quantity and quality of the tourism product.  The analysis showed that with selective investment the Irish tourism product has the potential to enable the industry to substantially expand its market share.The analysis recommended that support for tourism product development should be market driven, with less of a focus on  accommodation, other than in specified circumstances.  More investment is needed in tourism infrastructure and attractions.  Investment is also needed in major new events and other tourism products that will attract visitors.The strategy proposes a framework and policy guidance for the long-term development of the tourism product.  The 67 recommendations cover areas that include:Capital investment in the hard tourism product;Infrastructure and services relevant to tourists;The physical environment;Packaging and presentation; andExpanding the skills and capability of people working in the tourism industry.The recommended proposals fall into two areas: firstly a series of actions around the broader tourism agenda including protecting and managing the physical environment, enhancing access to and around the country and improving access to cultural heritage and secondly a series of funding supports.The key recommendations of the strategy are reflected in the tourism programme announced in the recently published National Development Plan, 2007-13. I am particularly pleased that the NDP allocation of €800m for tourism — €317m of which is earmarked for product development and infrastructure including provision for the PPP funded capital cost of the National Conference Centre — will enable essential development under the new product strategy to be activated this year. It will also significantly ramp up support available for tourism product development compared with the level of funding provided under the previous NDP. A capital financial envelope of close to €14m will be available this year to help launch the new strategy. In addition, many of the other NDP programmes will also deliver improvements in environmental and other infrastructure recommended by Fáilte Ireland.

During the Preferred Tenderer phase the Consortium is required to develop and provide the full range of project documents for review and approval by the Contracting Authority.  The current expectation is that the contract will be awarded within the coming weeks.  It is envisaged that site enabling and related works in preparation for construction would commence shortly thereafter and that the Centre would be operational some 40 months later.I am delighted that delivery of another major commitment in the Programme for Government may now be about to become a reality.

However, the main channel of State support to the NCC is the Arts Council.  The Arts Council under the Arts Act, 2003, is statutorily independent and I have no role to play in its funding decisions.I understand that the Arts Council is highly supportive of the National Chamber Choir and regards them as an important element of the music infrastructure.  Indeed funding to the Choir from the Arts Council has increased significantly in recent years, from €175,000 in 2001 to €345,000 in 2007 an increase of over 97%.  This underlines the Council's commitment to the NCC.

Further details of funding programmes provided by the Arts Council is available on their website www.artscouncil.ie.Fáilte Ireland allocates funding to assist festivals/cultural events through its Festivals and Cultural Events Initiative.  Further details on the initiative is available on the Fáilte Ireland website www.ireland.ie.  Both the Arts Council and Fáilte Ireland are independent of my Department in relation to their day-to-day operations and funding decisions.

In its Report, the Service makes it plain that it will continue its awareness raising work with the Gardaí to "increase the number of referrals".The referrals are of visitors from abroad who have been victims of crime.  The figures do not specify the length of stay of these visitors and the noted increase could also refer to the fact that visitors and agencies are now more aware of the work and assistance provided by ITAS for tourists.While the overwhelming majority of our visitors do not encounter crime, I fully subscribe to the view that there is no acceptable level of crime and that one outrage is one too many.All of us are aware of the impact a crime can have on a person but tourists are even more vulnerable. They are in a strange environment and their problems can be compounded by language, cultural and legal issues.Although the remit of the Irish Tourist Assistance Service is not in the area of crime prevention, it works closely with the Gardaí with whom it has an excellent, co-operative relationship.The Irish Tourist Assistance Service booklet — Helping Tourist Victims of Crime — is available in Garda Stations, Tourist Offices and car rental companies. 40,000 copies of the booklet were distributed to tourists, through the tourism industry, in 2006. I recently launched an ITAS DVD for distribution across the country which contains safety tips for tourists along with relevant information on where to access assistance.The Service, which is now known as Irish Tourist Assistance Service, was launched in 1994 and, since that time, has assisted over 8,000 visitors. It may not be widely known but Ireland is seen as a ‘best practice' model in Europe in terms of the support it provides tourists in the aftermath of crime.

This draft strategy was carefully considered in my Department, but the end conclusion was that it was not satisfactorily demonstrated that the benefits accruing from the suite of programmes and activities proposed by the interim Board would be commensurate with the costs involved. Accordingly, it was decided not to proceed to statutory establishment, and the Board was not renewed beyond its initial three-year term of office.The main channel through which State aid is provided to the arts is through  the Arts Council and all music genres continue to fall within its remit.  This year, I was pleased to be in a position to make an amount of €80m available to the Arts Council to support all areas of the arts, including music.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	775	With London 2012 fast approaching, athletes and teams from other countries may consider using Ireland as a base to prepare and train in the years prior to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012.  Ireland possesses the advantages of having the same climatic conditions and being in the same time zone as London, as well as being within an hour by air travel.  Furthermore, this country will avoid most of the media hype that one often finds in the host country.In order to ensure that Ireland benefits from the proximity of the Games, I established a Task Force in August 2006 comprising high level representatives from the sporting, business, tourism and cultural sectors.  This group is working to ensure that Ireland maximises the benefits arising from the proximity of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the areas of training camps for athletes, tourism, business and cultural opportunities.In relation to training camps specifically; if Ireland is to be attractive to potential participating athletes, access to high quality sporting and ancillary facilities must be available.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken a London 2012 sports infrastructural survey of facilities that might be suitable to develop to meet the training needs of overseas teams preparing for 2012. National Governing Bodies of Sport and third level institutions have been contacted in order to establish the type, range and suitability of the sports facilities available for this purpose.What is currently being undertaken therefore is a data gathering exercise to gauge the level of facilities Ireland has to offer to potential visiting athletes. This survey process is being completed in line with the standards set out by the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG).  We will then have a clearer picture of the facilities likely to be attractive to participating athletes in the build-up to London 2012 and my Department will then examine whether investment may be required to bring these facilities up to the required standard.  Any expenditure on facilities will be aimed not only at attracting teams but primarily at ensuring a lasting legacy for Irish athletes and communities.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The Arts Act 2003 gives the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism responsibility for promoting the arts within and outside of the State, thus recognising the international dimension of my remit.In recognition of the changed legislative environment, new mechanisms for the promotion and support of Irish art and artists abroad were put in place in February, 2005, when a new non-statutory body (Culture Ireland) was established, under the aegis of my Department.Since its establishment on a non-statutory basis, Culture Ireland conclusively demonstrated that there is an important and substantial job to be done in this area, and that the optimal way to do it effectively is through a State agency independent of its parent Department. The advice of the Attorney General is that a statutory body is the option which would most closely meet the requirements, i.e., it would have a separate legal identity, it could enter into contracts on its own authority, and have an independent responsibility for disbursement of funds. Accordingly, the Government authorised me to proceed with the preparation of legislation to establish the agency on a statutory basis.The international context provides a whole additional layer of opportunities for Irish artists. It provides new opportunities for exhibition and performances, and allows for very beneficial cross-fertilisation and sharing of experience and artistic expression with overseas counterparts. Commercially, it opens up new markets that can prove extremely valuable. Effective promotion of Irish arts in the international context also has very significant benefits in promoting Ireland's image abroad, which, in turn, can develop important diplomatic relationships, highlight our profile abroad, and enhance our relations with other peoples and cultures.The draft heads of legislation for the establishment of Culture Ireland on a statutory basis are currently being prepared in my Department.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	778	As I have previously indicated, I have had a number of meetings with both the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and the GAA at which player welfare issues for inter-county players were discussed.At these meetings and in subsequent letters to both the GPA and the GAA, I have set out the position of the Government on this issue.  I do not intend to provide direct funding to meet the costs either of direct grants to GAA players or of player welfare policies.  This responsibility rests with the GAA in the same manner as similar player welfare issues in other sports must be dealt with by the responsible National Governing Body of Sport.  In this context it is the exclusive prerogative of the Association to decide how it manages and funds such issues and I do not intend to influence the GAA as to the nature or cost of any new player welfare supports it may introduce.I have previously indicated, however, that in the event that agreement is reached between the GAA and the GPA on additional player welfare supports, I would be prepared to provide additional funding to the GAA on an annual basis, either through the existing Sports Capital Programme in respect of prioritised infrastructural projects or through additional funding by the Irish Sports Council in respect of Games development or a combination of both.Any moneys provided under these programmes would have the effect of freeing up existing moneys within the Association to meet the additional costs to the Association of agreed player welfare issues.  While I have indicated that an amount of €5 million could be set aside, it would be premature to lock into any particular funding mechanism or formally commit to any specific amount of such funding until such time as detailed costed proposals have been submitted to me by the GAA under the headings of infrastructure and games development and considered by my Department.  As any financial support to be provided by my Department would be considered in the context of the additional costs to the GAA of new player welfare supports, I would have to be satisfied as to the extent and nature of such supports taking into account the ultimate responsibility of the GAA for funding such supports and in the context of the Government's national sports policy.

St. Patrick's Day has traditionally signalled the start of the tourism season in Ireland and the international celebrations at this time afford a unique opportunity to promote tourism to the island of Ireland.Great Britain remains Ireland's most important overseas tourism market and at the invitation of the Mayor of London, Mr. Ken Livingstone, I attended the St. Patrick's Festival Dinner as Guest of Honour on the 17th March in the Savoy Hotel. On 18 March, I attended mass at the London Irish Centre following which I watched the London St. Patrick's Day Parade from the Trafalgar Square stage in the company of the Mayor of London. I also attended the Ireland Holiday Pavilion organised by Tourism Ireland at Trafalgar Square on 18 March.I am also pleased to inform the House that Culture Ireland provided €35,000 to Buí Bolg to participate in two London parades and a further €15,000 to the Greater London Authority for a programme of Irish events at Leicester Square.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.I have no plans to transfer responsibility for the allocation of this funding to an independent authority.  I believe that the current arrangements for administering the sports capital programme, which have been applied by successive governments over many years, have been extremely successful in ensuring that the programme is responsive to local needs.It is entirely appropriate that the Minister for Sport should be in a position to use this important instrument of sporting policy to achieve objectives such as supporting projects of particular local or regional significance or encouraging the development of as many sports as possible.  Over the period 1998-2006 inclusive, €483 million has been allocated in sports capital funding in 5,781 projects.  This massive investment in the creation of a sporting infrastructure is now yielding benefits both in terms of local community developments and increased participation in sport.  The scheme is administered in accordance with pre-determined eligibility criteria, all of which must be satisfied before projects may access funding allocated to them.I would remind the Deputy that as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I am directly accountable to Dáil Éireann for the operation of the sports capital programme.  This accountability is ongoing and finds expression, for example, through parliamentary questions, adjournment debates, estimates debates and engagement with Dáil Committees.  This is a feature which would be notably absent were the administration of the sports capital programme to be made the responsibility of an independent board.  Apart from the obvious issue of how one determines ‘independence', experience elsewhere has shown that decisions by independent boards do not always receive universal acceptance.  Where a grant scheme attracts a level of applications well in excess of available funding, as is the case with the sports capital programme, unsuccessful applicants will always experience an understandable sense of disappointment  whatever the decision-making process.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.Applications for funding under the 2007 programme were invited through advertisements in the Press on October 15th and 16th last. The closing date for receipt of applications was November 24th 2006. All applications received before the deadline are currently being evaluated on an individual basis by my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.The assessment process takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required.  Following the assessment process outlined above, each application will receive a score, which will give its order of priority within its own county.Recommendations will then be made to me regarding provisional allocations for each county, based on the most recent Census of Population figures. I am satisfied that the programme achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2007 programme as soon as possible after the assessment and recommendation processes has been completed.

These, in order of progress, are: Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  I understand that Donegal County Council has recently received a draft Preliminary Report on the swimming pool project from their consultants, which is under consideration, and that the finalised Preliminary Report is to be submitted to my Department in the next month.The Council has also advanced the Part 8 Planning application for the project to the public consultation stage this month.  I am advised that the strategy underlying the development of the project is to maximise the potential for the sharing of physical and management facilities with other sports organisations in the area.

There is no main automated telephone message for the Department, as calls are taken by switchboard staff who provide a high standard of service in Irish and English.  Indeed, in the Department's Official Languages Scheme, we state that we will request Eircom, who provide the switchboard staff, to ensure that such staff continue to have a good level of fluency in Irish.  Outside normal hours, calls are dealt with by security staff rather than by an automated message.There is a facility for staff to create customised voicemail messages in any language on their Direct Dial number and this facility is used by some members of staff.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs have prepared draft regulations dealing with, amongst other things, recorded oral announcements.  We are currently working to ensure that we are ready to meet all the requirements of these regulations, when they come into force.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	785	I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Authority is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.  The Board of the Authority is comprised of industry, employee and employer representatives and is responsible for implementing the legislation and developing policy in this area.I am informed that the licensing of contractors installing intruder alarms commenced on 1 August 2006.  In the interest of creating an equitable licensing regime which acknowledges the differing sizes of different businesses, the Board agreed to introduce a sliding scale of licence fees for contractors, depending on turnover.  For smaller businesses the total licence and administration fee, for a licence lasting two years, is €2,250.Regulation of the private security industry is being carried out by the Authority on a phased basis in full consultation with the industry and key stakeholders.  The private security industry itself supports regulation and had actively campaigned for it for many years.  The provision of a regulatory environment for the industry will increase confidence in its operation.  It is the case, however, that regulation will lead to some cost implications for operators in the various sectors.  Ultimately, it is the industry and the consumer who will benefit from the licensing regime introduced by the PSA.In relation to regulatory impact, Government approval of the heads of the Private Security Services Bill 2001 — and the legislative process which lead to the Private Security Services Act 2004 — predated the introduction of Regulatory Impact Assessment.  However, I am assured that the Private Security Authority is conscious of its responsibility to regulate in a way that promotes positive change in the industry without overburdening it.

The MBRS has responsibility for the continuing forensic integrity of the instruments.I am informed by the Garda authorities that evidential breath testing instruments are currently installed in 64 Garda locations, including all Divisional  Headquarters Garda stations as well as other stations where they are available to all members of An Garda Síochána on a 24-hour basis, every day of the year.  The installation of further evidential breath testing instruments is currently under consideration.These instruments, which determine the level of alcohol for evidential purposes, are not to be confused with other instruments which determine the presence of alcohol and which are typically deployed at roadside checkpoints.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258. Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000. The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of each District in the Wicklow/Wexford Division on 31 December, 1997 to 2006 and on 26 March, 2007 was as set out in the following table:Wicklow/Wexford’97’98’99’00’01’02’03’04’05’06’07Wexford768688818987898690101105Gorey6368686976797877808790Enniscorthy4143404144444445454748New Ross3740374241424141434848Wicklow5256575558586055546168Total269293290288308310312304312344354The personnel strength of the Wicklow/Wexford Division on 31 December, 1997 and 26 March, 2007 was 269 and 354 (all ranks) respectively. This represents an increase of 85 (or 31.5%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

Accordingly, it is open to any person, if s/he considers that there may have been such a contravention, to apply to the Complaints Referee for an investigation into the matter.  The current Complaints Referee is His Honour Judge Carroll Moran, Judge of the Circuit Court, who may be contacted via of the Office of the President of the Circuit Court, The Four Courts, Dublin 7.

As a consequence it is not the general policy to extend permission to remain to persons who are admitted initially for a period of 90 days or less on a C Visa, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.A wrap-around information sheet accompanies every visa application form.  That sheet makes it clear to the applicant that, in general, persons granted visas for particular purposes are not permitted to remain in the State for any purpose other than that for which the visa was granted.  Every visa applicant is required to state on the application form the dates on which he or she proposes to enter and leave Ireland.  He or she is also required to declare that the information supplied is correct and complete.The person concerned must leave and reapply for the appropriate visa from outside the State.  Should they wish to return, they should include in their new visa application the purpose and duration of their intended stay.

Part III of that Act  provides a special procedure, operated by the Property Registration Authority, whereby a person may acquire the fee simple in their dwelling house.A legal challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of existing ground rents legislation was heard in the High Court during 2005.  The court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006 but this has now been appealed to the Supreme Court and it is likely that the appeal will be heard later this year.  Any proposals for further reform of ground rents legislation leading to the abolition of ground rents would need to take into account the outcome of the case before the Supreme Court.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	804	The position is that the incapacitated child tax credit is only available to parents or guardians in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself as outlined in Section 465 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  I have no plans to extend the credit to parents or guardians of children with Asperger's syndrome who would not be considered as permanently incapacitated from maintaining themselves.It should be noted, however, that in recent years the Government has significantly increased the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders.  In this regard the Department of Education of Science has established:182 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools;5 special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome;16 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; and14 Stand alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis (two of these facilities have yet to come on stream).  The scheme is operated directly by the Department of Education and Science.In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established under the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004 to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.  Since it was established in 2005, the NCSE has been responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs.  The Council has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.  The Deputy may wish to note that it is projected that over €820 million of the 2007 Estimates allocation for the Department of Education and Science will be related to disability and special needs.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of licensing arrangements between developers and landowners.  The arrangement mentioned in the question arises where the developer obtains a licence from the landowner that entitles the developer to enter onto the land and erect buildings.  The usual way of achieving this is for the landowner to grant the developer or his bank or both a power of attorney, which allows them to execute a conveyance or transfer of the legal title to the ultimate purchaser without further recourse to the landowner.  Because there is no conveyance of the land from the landowner to the developer stamp duty does not arise at this point.  Stamp duty does, however, arise when the ultimate purchaser buys the land on which a building will usually have been erected by the developer, subject to the availability of the normal stamp duty reliefs.Section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is a general anti-avoidance measure.  It is intended to defeat the effects of transactions, which have little or no commercial reality but are intended primarily to avoid or reduce a tax charge or to artificially create a tax deduction or tax refund. Individual instances of licence agreements of the kind described above would be reviewed from this perspective.  To date no case has been identified for which it would be appropriate to invoke section 811 by reference to an absence of business purpose.The Deputy will be aware that the Finance Bill 2007 contains a specific proposal to amend the provisions of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999, to bring in a charge to Stamp Duty in certain circumstances where Licence Agreements are involved.  Briefly stated, the proposal, which is subject to a commencement order, is that where by virtue of a licence agreement, the landowner receives a payment amounting to 25% or more of the market value of the land in question, the agreement will be chargeable with Stamp Duty at the same rate as if there were a conveyance or transfer of the land.

I understand that the competitive dialogue stage of the process has been completed and that the Invitation to Tender will issue in the next few days.The core requirement of a co-located hospital will be to treat the private patients that are currently receiving treatment in the public hospital. The minimum requirements a co-located hospital must provide include:Ability to admit private patients directly from public hospital Emergency Departments, primary care centres and GPs on a 24/7 basis;Capacity to treat all private patients currently catered for in the public hospital;Joint Clinical Governance between the public hospital and the co-located hospital;Performance Management requirements and documented service level agreements;Shared Information and Records Management.Selected bidders must confirm their ability to meet these requirements before progressing to the invitation to tender stage of the procurement process.  There will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice. There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of all proposals.

The development of GP co-operatives is in line with the overall health service policy of strengthening primary care services and ensuring that to the greatest extent possible, people's care needs are met in the primary care setting.Out of hours co-operatives are now in place in all Health Service Executive (HSE) areas, providing coverage in all or in part of all counties.  Between 2000 and 2006 approximately €139 million was allocated to the HSE for out of hours GP co-operatives.  In 2007, the HSE Vote includes almost €34 million in baseline funding for these services and a further €3 million to meet the full year cost of Co-op developments commenced in 2006.  These figures do not include the fees of the participating doctors.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for this service, it is the appropriate body to provide the information sought by the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	822	Demand for speech and language therapy in the health services is very significant, hence the substantial investment which has been provided over the last number of years.  The number of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service has grown from 281 WTEs in 1997 to 654 WTEs at end December 2006, a 133% growth in that period.  The Government has also committed to further investment in disability services via the multi-annual investment plan and this will see further increases in the speech and language therapy resources available.A particular priority for the Department of Health and Children in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates, including speech and language therapists.  In response to concerns regarding labour shortages, the Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions to 2015 in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (Bacon Report).The Report was published in 2001 and arising from its recommendations additional courses in speech and language therapy providing 75 places were established in three universities.  UCC, NUIG and UL each established courses in speech and language therapy with 25 places on each of the 3 courses.  The first cohort of graduates from the UL masters level course in speech and language therapy graduated in 2005 and the first cohort from the bachelor degree programmes in UCC and NUIG will graduate this year.  This investment represents an increase in training capacity of 300% in speech and language therapy.  The total number of speech and language therapy training places now stands at 100, the level at which the Bacon Report recommended as being sufficient to meet current and future demand to 2015 for speech and language therapists.The health service acknowledges the major importance of early intervention, hence the decision to initiate implementation of the Disability Act for children aged 0-5 on 1 June of this year.  Under the multi-annual investment programme for people with disabilities 2006-2009, the sum of €12.5 million was provided in 2006 and a further €15 million is being provided in 2007 to enhance the level and range of multidisciplinary support services with the priority in both years being to enhance the assessment and support services to children with a disability.

This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multidisciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	828	Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.

In July 2005, following Government approval, I issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive to develop co-located private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.  The aim of this initiative is to transfer private activity from within the public hospital system to new privately-financed and managed facilities and thereby free up approximately 1,000 additional beds for public patients.The land to develop co-located private hospitals will be leased on a commercial basis to successful bidders.  There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of all proposals.  Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.   There will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.

Checks on compliance with the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations are being incorporated into routine hygiene inspections for establishments covered by these regulations.  Such inspections are carried out by the Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) in the Health Service Executive (HSE) operating under a service contract with the FSAI.As the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 307 of 2006) which have been recently amended by Health (Country of Origin of Beef) (Amendment) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 85 of 2007) are relatively new, the arrangements for recording specific checks for compliance have yet to be finalised.  Discussions are ongoing in this regard.My Department has recognised the need to provide clear information to food business operators regarding their obligation to comply with the new regulations.  An explanatory leaflet has been prepared by the FSAI and will be circulated to all relevant food businesses in the coming weeks.  A guidance note for EHOs on the enforcement of the regulations was circulated earlier this month.

Under the Act only persons who hold a relevant medical or veterinary qualification are eligible to be appointed as, or assigned the duties of, inspector.  The role of inspector is primarily one of animal welfare and all appointed inspectors are veterinary officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Officials of my Department do not carry out these inspections.The latest statistics on the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes are in respect of 2005 and these are available on my Department's website, www.dohc.ie.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	835	The Television Without Frontiers Directive provides that member states of the European Communities may designate certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and that events so designated should continue to be available on a free television service.  The Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999 (Designation of Major Events) Order 2003 specified the events designated as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on free television services should be provided in the public interest.Section 9 of the Broadcasting ( Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Act 2003 requires me to carry out a review of designated events not later than three years after the passing of the 2003 Act and every three years thereafter, that is to say, not later than 2009.  Following a review of designated events in 2006, I announced on 5 April 2006 that it was my intention, following consultation with my Cabinet colleagues, to continue to designate the current list of designated events as events of major importance to society for which the right of a qualifying broadcaster to provide coverage on a live basis on free television should be provided in the public interest.This decision was made following a public consultation process conducted by my Department that resulted in close to 190 submissions being received from members of the public and interested parties.  The designation of events as events of major importance to society provides a right of access to qualifying broadcasters, that is broadcasters who provide near universal coverage, to provide coverage of a designated event on free television services subject to normal commercial considerations for broadcasting.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	836	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, (ComReg).The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open access, carrier neutral Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities.  Twenty-seven of these have been completed with the remaining due for completion during 2007 and 2008.  These Metropolitan Area Networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  Complementary to the MAN networks, the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) has funded over 120 projects specifically aimed at smaller communities.However, despite this Government investment and private sector investment I am aware that there are still some parts of the country where the private sector is unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity.  A Steering Committee comprising officials from my Department and ComReg is currently finalising a new scheme, the National Broadband Scheme.  The scheme, when it is fully rolled out, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband from houses and premises in areas unserved by broadband are met. Work on the design of an appropriate public tender is under way.  The tender will be technology neutral, meaning all Service Providers regardless of the platform over which a service is provided, can compete under the tender process.

My visit to Kiev in July 2005 and then Foreign Minister Tarasyuk's return visit to Dublin in February 2006 were the first official bilateral visits at Foreign Minister level between our two countries since the establishment of diplomatic relations fifteen years ago.  The Ceann Comhairle and six members of the Oireachtas also visited Ukraine in October 2005 and were received at the highest level; an invitation has been extended to the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament to make a return visit to Ireland in October.Ukraine's Parliamentary elections in March 2006 consolidated the earlier democratic breakthrough.  A new government was established in August 2006.  However, disputes centred on the relative powers of the President and the Prime Minister have persisted.  The uncertain political situation in Ukraine has caused some unavoidable loss of momentum in bilateral relations.  Nevertheless, the procedure for periodic political consultations between my Department and the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry agreed during my visit to Kiev was initiated with a high-level meeting last October.From a low base, the value of trade in goods and services between Ireland and Ukraine rose from €59.2 million in 2004 to €96.3 million in 2005 and this trend is expected to continue.  In June 2006, Minister of State Michael Ahern T.D. led Enterprise Ireland's first Trade Mission to Ukraine.  21 Irish companies and organisations participated and a further trade mission is planned later this year.  There have been a number of significant Irish investments in Ukraine, suggesting that Irish business is becoming more aware of commercial opportunities there.Ireland has contributed to a number of development projects in Ukraine.  In particular, we are assisting in the area of administrative capacity building and would intend to continue to support Ukraine's reform process to the degree possible.  Ireland is also an active participant in the elaboration of EU policy to support Ukraine in the work of consolidating democracy and implementing economic reform under the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan.  In this regard, negotiations recently got under way on an enhanced agreement between the EU and Ukraine.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The White Paper, published in September 2006, sets out the direction that the Irish Aid programme will take over the coming years and reiterates the key principles that underlie our development efforts.  It builds on the experience gained over our 32-year history and charts the path for Ireland's contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.Many of the initiatives outlined in the White Paper are now underway and progressing successfully:We are in the final stages of the first recruitment campaign for Ireland's Rapid Response Corps.  Establishment of the Corps was a key element in the White Paper.  We have had a very positive response to our call for skilled professionals to apply to join the Corps.  Interviews are currently being conducted and training for successful applicants will begin at the end of April.To further strengthen Ireland's response to disasters a new agreement has been reached with the World Food Programme, for the pre-positioning of emergency supplies at Brindisi, Italy, Accra in Ghana and at the Curragh.  The Irish Aid-funded supplies are part of an international network of bases designed to respond to major crises within 48 hours of needs being declared.In the coming weeks the first meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on Development recommended in the White Paper will take place.  The Committee will strengthen coherence in the Government's overall approach to development and will ensure best use is made of the range of expertise and skills available across the civil service.I will shortly announce the terms of reference and membership for the Hunger Task Force.  The task force, made up of Irish and international experts, will examine the particular contribution that Ireland can make to tackling the root causes of chronic food insecurity and hunger, particularly in Africa.A key decision of the White Paper was to increase the number of partner countries in which Irish Aid works.  Malawi was recently designed as our ninth partner country and a development cooperation programme is expected to begin there shortly.Increasing public understanding and awareness of the work of Irish Aid was another key decision in the White Paper.  Last month a summary of the White Paper was distributed to every home in the country.  We have had a very positive response.  Over the past couple of months, over 50,000 people have downloaded the White Paper and traffic on the Irish Aid website has nearly tripled.  Later this year, Irish Aid will open an Information and Volunteering Centre on Dublin's O'Connell Street.  The centre will be an important resource for people interested in volunteering and in development issues more broadly.Irish Aid is also working to implement the key decisions in the White Paper in areas such as good governance, investing in social and productive sectors and in conflict prevention and peace-building to ensure that our programme is as effective as possible in tackling poverty and promoting the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.Full implementation of all the initiatives in the White Paper is ongoing but we have made good progress to date.  The White Paper has set down a clear roadmap as the development assistance budget increases significantly over the coming years.

The Government fully supports the leadership of the UN Secretary General in this important work, and we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative to Cyprus, Mr. Michael Moeller, to bring both sides together to seek progress toward a political settlement.The most recent initiative in this regard dates from July 2006, when UN Under Secretary General Gambari brokered an agreement between President Papadopoulos and Mr Mehmet Ali Talat, representing the Turkish Cypriot community, on a set of principles and decisions recognising that the status quo was unacceptable and that a comprehensive settlement was both desirable and possible. They agreed to begin immediately a two-track process involving discussions by technical committees of issues affecting the day-to-day life of the people and, concurrently, of substantive issues leading to a comprehensive settlement. Regrettably however, these committees were not subsequently set up amid disagreements as to which committee was responsible for which issues. Consultations to try to resolve the impasse resumed at the end of January 2007, under the auspices of the Special Representative, but without success as yet.On a more hopeful note, there have been some positive steps in recent months by both sides in relation to access across the Green Line which divides the communities. These have focused on the Ledra Street Crossing in Nicosia, where most recently the Cypriot authorities have removed a wall which has divided the communities there since 1963. We welcome this step, and all actions that help to create the conditions for the opening of these crossing points, which can in turn increase the level of contact and confidence between the two communities.Ireland will continue, through our Embassy in Nicosia, to encourage both sides to renew their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of the objective of a bizonal, bicommunal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic interests and aspirations of all.

By the end of 2006, the Government had invested over €900 million directly into sport since 1997, to support the promotion and development of Irish sport and the provision of a modern sporting infrastructure with high quality facilities catering for the participation, coaching, training and competition needs of all levels and types of sport.  This amount included expenditure under the Sports Capital Programme and the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme; funding allocated to the Irish Sports Council, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon; and spending on the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road, Croke Park and the development of a sports campus at Abbotstown.Sports funding, mainly through the National Lottery-funded sport capital programme administered by my Department, has been enormously beneficial to clubs, sports organisations and voluntary and community groups in virtually every village, parish and town throughout the country.  In the past ten years, a total of over €494.8 million has been allocated in sports capital funding to 6,296 projects in villages, towns and parishes throughout the country, with special attention being given to facilities in areas of social and economic disadvantage.The projects funded include the provision and development of facilities such as natural playing surfaces, synthetic and all-weather playing surfaces, changing facilities, floodlighting, indoor sports halls, and a vast range of sports equipment.  While the majority of the funding has been to local clubs and organisations, it has also catered for the development of sporting infrastructure at regional and national level, thereby increasing the general participation in sport while also enhancing the level of coaching and competitiveness.  Significant national sporting centres funded include those for the sports of Rowing, Hockey, Boxing and Tennis.Grant aid under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme from 1997 to end February 2007 amounts to €93,677,542.  The provision of sufficient public swimming pools throughout the country, catering for both current and potential demand, is essential to broader societal goals for healthy adult lifestyles and the promotion of all aspects of children's development.The Irish Sports Council, the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, has received funding totalling €204.6 million since it was established in 1999 up to the end of 2006.  The Sports Council's funding allocation for 2007 stands at over €54 million.  This money has been spent on initiating, developing and enhancing a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport, including direct support in terms of grant-aid and indirect support in terms of sport science and medical backup to elite and top aspiring athletes.  An Irish Institute of Sport has also been established to deliver optimal support services for Olympic and Paralympic athletes and sports.Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, as approved by the Oireachtas.  Under the provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, the Fund receives a guaranteed level of finance based on the excise duty on off-course betting.  Since 2001, this Fund has provided a guaranteed level of funding to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon, which, by the end of 2006, amounted to €317 million and €79 million respectively.  In 2007, the horse and greyhound racing industries will receive over €58 million and €14 million respectively from the Fund.  This commitment to funding has enabled Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to undertake a programme of capital investment that has underpinned a growth in the sectors.Government funding to Croke Park amounts to approximately €114 million.  This includes an allocation of €3.65m at the end of 2006 towards the installation of floodlights, which has further enhanced what can now be regarded as a world-class stadium.  This 82,300-capacity modern facility, fully equipped to cater for hurling, football and camogie matches, is a fitting platform for players, both male and female, to display their talents.  The stadium has also been the venue for Ireland's International Rules matches against Australia, has hosted the ceremonies for the Special Olympics held here in Ireland in 2003 and accommodated recent rugby and soccer internationals in Croke Park, an arrangement which will continue this year and next.In January 2004, the Government agreed to provide funding of €191 million towards the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road Stadium as a 50,000-capacity all-seater state-of-the-art facility.  Expenditure to date amounts to almost €23 million.  The recent decision by An Bord Pleanála has now cleared the way for the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road to commence.  The new stadium will meet the needs of the modern games of rugby and soccer while also providing a platform to showcase the talent of our international teams to the world, allowing them to build on the progress that they have made to date.The Government is committed to the development of a campus of sports facilities at Abbotstown, which can be seen as a real and tangible symbol of Ireland's determination to compete on the international stage by ensuring that our sports men and women have at their disposal cutting edge sporting facilities.  The National Aquatic Centre, which opened in 2003, was the first facility developed at the Sports Campus at Abbotstown.  The capital expenditure on the Centre was almost €71 million and the Centre was completed on time and within budget.The Government has provided an amount of €149 million under the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013 for the development of the Abbotstown Campus. This comprises €119 million to fund Phase One of the Campus project and €30 million, committed at this stage, towards the development of further facilities in the next phase of development.The facilities to be provided in Phase One of the project will include: a National Field Sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 Governing Bodies of Sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science/medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.This unprecedented level of investment in sport is clear evidence of the importance that the Government attaches to establishing modern, well-equipped and well-managed sporting facilities supported by a wide range of programmes that are significantly benefiting our communities.

Appointments to the Board are made in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association of IMMA.There is currently one vacancy on the Board of Governors and Guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland.  There will be an additional vacancy on the Board from 31st March 2007. The National Gallery of Ireland, Board of Governors and Guardians was constituted under the National Gallery of Ireland Acts, 1854-55.Four vacancies will arise on the Board of Fáilte Ireland on the 28th May 2007. Appointments to the Board are made in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 14 of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003.In appointing persons to the Boards of key bodies under the aegis of my Department I follow the guidelines set out in the Cabinet Handbook regarding eligibility, transparency and gender balance.

The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following: to stimulate public interest in the arts; to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; and to assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.  During my own term as the Minister responsible for the arts, funding for the Arts Council has increased by almost 68% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007.  These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts and allowed the Arts Council to support artists and arts organisations nationwide.My Department has taken a more direct role in relation to the provision of grant-aid for arts and culture infrastructure and has provided substantial funding for the capital development of facilities around the country in recent years.  For example, my Department has provided over €43m to 40 arts facilities through the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS).  Furthermore I hope to shortly announce the successful applicants under the new round of ACCESS II funding.  ACCESS has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of quality cultural spaces throughout the country.

I have discussed stadia needs of National Governing Bodies at a number of meetings in the context of the allocation of funding for such projects.The principal ongoing source of Government funding for sports facilities is the Sports Capital Programme and since 1998, capital funding of €483m has been provided to 5,781 projects.  Included among these projects is a network of top quality national facilities including stadia  for various sports bodies. These include the National Rowing Centre at Inniscarra, the National Tennis Centre, the National Boxing Stadium, the National Hockey Stadium at UCD, GAA County grounds, soccer stadia and rugby stadia.In addition there are separate individual programmes of funding for major sports projects including the Government contribution to investments at Croke Park (€114m) for the GAA, Lansdowne Road Stadium (€191m) for the IRFU and FAI jointly, and the development of the National Aquatic Centre which benefits a number of water sports and leisure water activities and the National Sports Campus at Abbotstown which will provide facilities for the benefit of over 30 Governing Bodies of Sport.Government funding of the Irish horse and greyhound racing industries through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has enabled a programme of capital investment in horse and greyhound racing tracks in recent years which has underpinned a growth in both sectors. This will continue under the new National Development Plan for 2007-2013 which includes a provision of €70 million for both industries and will enable Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to undertake the further development of a network of racing  stadium facilities.The Deputy will be aware that my Department is currently developing a national Sports Facility Strategy.  The intention is that, when completed, the Strategy will provide better policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  Consultants have been recently engaged by the Department to assist in this process and are currently managing a consultation process to establish the views of sporting bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and any other interested parties on the future provision of sports facilities by Government. This consultation process will offer National Governing Bodies of Sport an unique opportunity to have a say in the design of the future strategy for sports facilities in Ireland.   The Strategy should be completed by the Summer.

It has been a major objective of tourism policy and has long been supported by industry interests and endorsed by the Tourism Policy Review Group. The new services to the US will facilitate the opening of new markets for Irish tourism. In this regard, I know that the airline carriers will be anxious to exploit the new opportunities.Aer Lingus has already announced that it proposes to commence new services to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles later this year.In terms of the additional accommodation requirements, I am aware that Fáilte Ireland's Hotel Survey recorded an annual room occupancy of 64% in 2006 indicating that, throughout the year and across the regions, there is capacity available in the hotel sector.Developments will, of course, be kept under review by the Tourism Strategy Implementation Group and the Tourism Agencies to ensure that the Irish Tourism industry benefits to the maximum extent from this excellent new opportunity.

The tender process in respect of the permanent building was completed some time ago and the Office of Public Works (OPW) selected the preferred bidder, P. J. Hegarty & Sons.  Planning permission has been granted.  The OPW expects the developer to be on site shortly and the building is expected to be ready for occupation by mid 2008.The total number of staff in the Department is 130.  Of that number, 47 staff (including 2 new Service Officers) have now moved to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney.   In the summer of 2007, the Department will decentralise a further 22 posts to the temporary offices in Fossa. Units from each of the sectoral areas of Arts, Sport and Tourism have been selected for inclusion in the second phase of the advance move.  The temporary accommodation is capable of accommodating up to 70 officers.The final phase, i.e. the move to the permanent accommodation in Killarney town is now expected to take place by mid 2008.

This comprises €119m to fund Phase One of the Campus project and €30m, committed at this stage, towards the development of further facilities in the next phase of development.The facilities to be provided in Phase One of the development will meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons who compete at national and international levels and will also provide for the needs of the local community.  Preliminary planning for this phase has commenced and the National Sports Campus Development Authority is currently preparing a Tender to appoint a Design and Project Management Team for the project.  It is too early in the development stage of the project to have projected statistics for utilisation of the facilities but the National Governing Bodies have confirmed their willingness to use the facility extensively, when it is developed.The facilities to be provided in Phase One of the project will include: a National Field Sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a National Indoor Training Centre which will provide world class training facilities for over 30 Governing Bodies of Sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science/medical facilities; all-weather synthetic pitches for community use; and renovation of existing buildings to cater for needs identified by sports bodies.The Government decision for this stage of development included agreement to move the HQ of FAI to the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown. Planning permission for a change of use for the State Laboratory was secured and work on the building is about to get underway. Subject to suitable terms on the lease being finalised, it is expected that the FAI will relocate there during this year.  It is also intended to provide a headquarters for the Institute for Sport by refurbishing an existing building on the site and the Institute should be based there later this year.A planning study for the Abbotstown site has recently been completed by an inter-agency group, which included the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which was undertaken under the provisions of the Fingal County Development Plan.  This Study sets out the mix of sporting, leisure, and amenity facilities that would be appropriate for the site. The Planning Study was presented to Fingal County Council and was considered at a Council Meeting on 12 March.  A proposal to change the Zoning of a large portion of the site to "Open Space" to allow for Sports Use and for the woodland area of the site to be zoned "High Amenity" will be considered by the Council before the summer.In January, under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006, the National Sports Campus Development Authority was established on a statutory basis to succeed in function and responsibility Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company Ltd (CSID). To coincide with the coming into being of the new Authority, the Board was appointed which was composed of a judicious mix of the Board Members of the former company CSID and some new faces who will bring their particular expertise to the tasks facing the new Authority, under the Chairmanship of Mr Dan Flinter.  In addition to overseeing the development of Phase One of the Campus, the new Board has been requested to identify and prioritise the next phase of the development of the Abbotstown project.The Abbotstown facilities, when completed will provide a much needed range of training and competitive facilities for our sportspersons who continue to represent our country with passion, pride and success.

It is not possible to state at this stage how much of the subhead provision will be paid to grantees from County Kildare in 2007 as payments are dependent on grantees themselves progressing or completing their projects and satisfying the conditions for grant payments as outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	858	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.As part of the restructuring of CE approved in 1999, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at 3 years, effective from April, 2000.   This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training/education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals. The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. In general, approximately 20% of participants including persons less than 55 years of age may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.In November 2004, it was decided that the 3-year cap would be extended for CE participants aged over 55.  This category of participants is now eligible to participate on CE for a maximum of 6 years.In July 2006 my Department published its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005.   One of the key highlights of this Plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the Plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities, in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment: for people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from 3 to 4 years; for people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from 6 to 7 years.I am informed by FÁS that the participation limits to which I have referred will continue to be operated flexibly at local level.

Some 2 appointments will be made to the Board of Shannon Development before 31 May 2007.  Appointments to the Board are made by myself, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  One appointment will be made to the Board of Forfás arising from the resignation of the acting Director General of Science Foundation Ireland.  The legislation provides that the Director General of SFI must be on the Board of Forfás. Accordingly the incoming Director General of SFI will be appointed to the board of Forfás on appointment.  However I do not expect this to happen until possibly July of this year.Some 3 appointments to the Board of the NSAI will be made in April of this year.  Some 13 appointments consisting of 12 members and a chairperson will be made to the Board of the National Consumer Agency, on enactment of the Consumer Protection Bill.  It is most likely that the Bill will be enacted within the timeframe referred to in the question and that the Board of the Agency shall be appointed by the Minister prior to the start of June.  Some 6 Rights Commissioners will be appointed before 31 May 2007, 5 under the terms of Towards 2016, and 1 arising from a vacancy.As 4 members of the Board of the NCC are required to retire on 31 May each year, 4 appointments will be made subsequent to these retirements.  Some 16 appointments will be made before 31 May 2007, to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, which has recently completed its term of office.  The Group will be in place until end-2009.  Appointments to the Advisory Board of the NERA may be made before 31 May 2007.

He signed Form RP2 acknowledging receipt of the statutory redundancy payment.  A period of lay-off due to strike action, from 8th July to 8th August 1980 and from 16 to 26 September 1984, which amounted to 43 days, was deducted from the calculation of total service.An employee must seek a statutory redundancy lump sum or part thereof from his former employer within 12 months from the date of termination of his employment.  If he were dissatisfied with the Redundancy Lump Sum he could have lodged an appeal with the Employment Appeals Tribunal also within 12 months from the date of termination.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal has discretion to extend this 12-month period to 2 years.  As it is now over 2 years since the redundancy in question, the person concerned is now out of time for bringing a claim for any balance of his statutory redundancy payment before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.

The law on industrial relations disputes does not generally seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but rather seeks to assist them in arriving at a solution.I understand that the Labour Court held a hearing in relation to the dispute referred to by the deputy and their Recommendation on the matter issued in August 2006.  As it is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendations.Recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding however and ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.

Since late 2004, following the "Orange Revolution" in that country, a number of initiatives have been undertaken by  the EI office in Moscow (which also services the Ukraine), to increase and deepen trade ties between the two countries.Following a successful EI seminar on business in Ukraine in 2005, I myself led Ireland's first ever official Trade Mission to that country in June 2006. 21 companies and organisations participated, including representatives of state and semi-state bodies. Over 100 buyer meetings were directly brokered by EI during the course of the mission. In June this year, EI will run a 5 day Market Study Visit to Ukraine for a delegation of their client companies. This visit will concentrate on the capital, Kyiv, but will also afford participants the opportunity to explore business opportunities in Lviv, in Western Ukraine, where a number of Irish companies have set up operations.EI has, over the past 2 years, built up a substantial network of Ukrainian contacts and support resources, and has focused its efforts on sectors such as IT and Telecommunications, Financial Services/ Banking Systems, Education, Medical Devices and Agricultural Machinery, which have been identified as markets likely to generate the most opportunities in the short to medium term for Irish industry. Linkages have been developed with local trade and business associations and with private contractors, to provide logistic support for Irish companies when they visit the Ukrainian market.In 2006, EI launched a Ukrainian domain corporate website, www.enterprise-ireland.com.ua, to provide Ukrainian businesses with economic information about Ireland and to highlight the activities of Irish companies active there. The website is in Russian and readily accessible as a valuable information resource for the large section of the Ukrainian population who are native and second language Russian speakers. It is planned to add Ukrainian language content to the website later this year.Irish merchandise exports to Ukraine increased by 49% between 2004 and 2005 and by 8% between 2005 and 2006, when they reached  €25.2m. Irish services exports to Ukraine have shown an even more dramatic change, with an increase of 71% to €60m between 2004 and 2005 (the latest full year for which services data are available). Merchandise imports from Ukraine have also been increasing and currently stand at €9.3m for 2006, while services imports were €4m in 2005.Discussions have been ongoing for some time to conclude a Double Taxation Agreement with Ukraine, which would significantly reduce the barriers to international business and trade between our two countries.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass.The scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.I have raised the issue with Commissioner Spidla and officials from my Department met with European Commission officials on a number of occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved. I am keeping this issue under review.

If the child reaches age 22 during an academic year while attending a full-time day course of education, they continue to be regarded as a qualified child up to the end of that academic year, provided they continue to receive full-time education.I am satisfied that this provision assists social welfare recipients in supporting a qualified child dependant up to and including primary degree level in most cases. Any improvement could only be considered in a budgetary context and in light of competing priorities.I have no immediate plans to change current arrangements but I will keep the matter under review.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	869	Until 1974, liability for social insurance contributions was compulsory for almost all workers over the age of sixteen years who were either manual workers employed under a contract of service, regardless of their remuneration, or non-manual workers whose remuneration did not exceed a specified limit.The remuneration limit in 1974 was £1,600 per annum for full-time workers or equivalent for part-time workers. This had been increased from £600 per annum from 5 January, 1953, £800 per annum from December, 1958, £1,200 from September, 1965, and £1,600 from May, 1971 until the remuneration limit was removed on 31st March, 1974. There were no changes to insurance liability in 1967.The removal of the remuneration limit was due to the recognition that traditional differences in pay and conditions between manual and non-manual workers had been gradually eroded, that the borderline between what constitutes manual work and non-manual work had become blurred and that similar arrangements in European social security codes were gradually being removed. Accordingly, it was decided there were arguments for treating manual and non-manual workers equally within the social insurance system.There is no record of a legal challenge in relation to these provisions. Decisions made by Appeals Officers some thirty five years ago are not now available.Where a non-manual worker reached the insurable limit and was therefore no longer compulsorily insured, the legislation enabled that worker to make voluntary contributions provided he or she had a minimum of 156 contributions paid and applied within a prescribed period.There is no scope in legislation to facilitate the payment of contributions that were not due or to retrospectively pay social insurance contributions for which a person was not liable. However, in recognition of the fact that some workers may have been in and out of insurance coverage over their working life because of fluctuations in their earnings, special arrangements were put in place in 1988 with the introduction of special partial pensions related to the average of the contributions paid, subject to a minimum average of five full-rate contributions paid or credited.

Other programmes and schemes administered by, or on behalf of, my Department are open to community groups regardless of their ethnicity.  Information on the various schemes is available on the Department's website at www.pobail.ie.The LDSIP aims to counter disadvantage, promote equality, social and economic inclusion through the provision of funding and support to local partnerships. The programme is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department and is delivered through 69 local and community partnerships companies and two Employment Pacts in designated areas.Refugees, asylum seekers, migrant workers and their families are all named as target groups of the LDSIP.  Partnerships have developed actions to support the integration of ethnic minority communities in the areas of labour market, community development, and community-based youth initiatives.Since December 2006 actions under the LDSIP have been complemented by the Initiative to Support the Integration of Legally Resident Immigrants (which is the responsibility of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform). One strand of this Initiative is specifically for partnerships companies to support local-level strategies.  To date 15 Partnerships have been awarded funding.In addition, six Partnerships were funded in 2006 through the Vulnerable Immigrants Measure of the Dormant Accounts Fund, to enhance the employability of legally resident immigrants in their areas.My Department's Community Development Programme supports the core costs of 182 community projects located in areas of disadvantage throughout the country.  These projects are managed by local voluntary management committee and provide a focal point for community activity within their area of operation.  Ethnic minority groups, where they experience disadvantage and/or marginalisation, are one of a number of target groups that benefit under the programme.

Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.    The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to investment in land and B(iv) in relation to investment in buildings and has been deemed successful.The person named also benefited from another measure (Force Majeure during the reference period) under which the year 2001 was removed when calculating his entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme.The Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks must be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve, to an applicant who has already benefited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme, does not result in double benefit.  An applicant may only benefit from the measure that is most beneficial.  All checks have now been completed and it has been established that an allocation from the National Reserve is more beneficial in this case and therefore the Force Majeure status has been rescinded in favour of an allocation from the National Reserve.A formal letter outlining my Department's decision has issued to the person named and the relevant payment due will issue shortly.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.An appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 was heard in October 2006 in respect of a refusal by a Special School to enrol the child referred to by the Deputy. The appeal was not upheld. In issuing its findings the appeals committee reported that the school in question was not an appropriate placement for this child in light of her educational needs. The child has been diagnosed with significant acquired brain injury and requires specialist advice and input regarding her educational placement.The appeals committee recommended that the National Educational Welfare Board, in consultation with The National Council for Special Education, should assist the child's parents in arranging for a suitable educational placement. The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is aware of this case and an Educational Welfare Officer, EWO, has been assisting the child's mother in seeking an appropriate placement.My Department has sanctioned home tuition hours for the child as an interim measure.  A home tutor with experience in working with persons with Acquired Brain Injury was sourced by the EWO and this home tuition arrangement is currently ongoing.The Appeals Committee also recommended that a further assessment of the child should be carried out and this took place in December 2006. Following the results of the assessment, the EWO contacted and made applications to a number of schools in the Dublin area that cater for children with Mild Learning Disability.The NEWB has informed my Department that, to date, one school has said it is full but will process an application for September 2007. A second school has refused to enrol the child and my Department is informed that the mother has decided not to appeal this decision.  A third school is reviewing the application and has asked the EWO to set up a professionals meeting and this process is in hand.

These arrangements provide that membership of the pension scheme will be effective from 1 September 2001 in the case of eligible caretakers in service at that time. The pension scheme will be a contributory, defined benefit scheme and will provide standard public service pension benefits.Deduction of ongoing contributions commenced from eligible personnel with effect from 7 March 2006. Arrears of contributions are payable in respect of the period from 1 September 2001 to the date ongoing deductions commenced, or the date membership ended if earlier. Eligible staff will be notified in due course of the arrears due in respect of that period. In accordance with standard public service arrangements, there is also provision for reckoning service given prior to 1 September 2001 subject to verification of the service concerned and payment of the appropriate contributions.The specific case referred to by the Deputy is currently being examined. I will arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy confirming the position.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	890	Two Montessori qualifications are currently recognised for the purpose of appointment to the following posts in primary schools: resource teaching posts, special classes and special schools. The two recognised qualifications are (i) the three-year full-time course in the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) College, Mount St. Mary's, Milltown, Dublin 14 and (ii) the HETAC accredited B.A. in Montessori Education or B.A. (Hons.) in Montessori Education in St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire. Teachers with Montessori qualifications recognised by my Department are also eligible to work as substitute teachers in mainstream primary schools.Teachers with the above recognised Montessori qualifications are granted restricted recognition to teach in special schools and in the categories of special classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. Such teachers are also eligible for posts as resource teachers (low incidence) for children with special needs in mainstream schools (Circular 02/2005). The conditions governing the recognition of qualifications are set out in Circular 25/00, "Recognition of Teacher Qualifications for the Purpose of Teaching in National Schools".The Deputy may be aware that, with effect from 28th March, 2006, the Teaching Council is the designated authority for recognition of qualifications for the regulated profession of primary teacher.  The issue raised in relation to the Irish requirement for Montessori teachers should be taken up with the Council.I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department has agreed to a request from the Irish Montessori Education Board for a meeting to discuss issues of concern to them. The necessary arrangements for the holding of the meeting will be made as soon as possible.

The Scheme, which covers the period 2005-2008, includes a commitment to provide a dedicated telephone number for Irish speaking customers. In order to meet this commitment, a targeted language training programme is being delivered to increase the numbers of staff capable of providing services through Irish.

As the halls are of a much greater magnitude than the average school PE hall, issues relating to the funding, management structure and staffing of the halls have had to be considered.My Department is at present considering detailed proposals which have been put forward by the trustees of the school in question in relation to the future operation of the sports hall. Following such consideration, my Department will revert to the trustees with a view to reaching agreement at an early date on the future management arrangements for the hall, taking into account issues relating to both school and community access.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I am anxious for schools to appoint the most suitable people to language support posts and am determined to ensure that language support teachers have access to the right assessment tools to help them to establish the abilities and needs of individual students.In order to ensure that schools can accurately and objectively assess the language requirement of children, my Department will be sending to primary schools assessment materials which have been developed by Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT). The assessment materials will enable schools to ensure that the specific language requirements of children needing support are met in a targeted way. The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.In relation to the question of ethos raised by the Deputy, the position is that section 15 of the Education Act states that it is the duty of the Board of Management "to manage the school(s) on behalf of the patron" and "uphold, and be accountable to the patron for so upholding, the characteristic spirit of the school(s) as determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious, social, linguistic and spiritual values and traditions which inform and are characteristic of the objectives and conduct of the school...".

Officials from my Department will be in further contact with the school authorities when the Stage 3 documentation has been received and evaluated.Progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	899	My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees (TLT) and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses (PLC). The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  In order to qualify for financial assistance under the Third Level Student Support Schemes operated by my Department, a person must pursue a full-time undergraduate course, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at an approved third level institution.Under the Free Fees Initiative, the Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses which must be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.An undergraduate course by distance learning, is not regarded as full-time study, accordingly, such students are ineligible for grant assistance under the Third Level Student Support Schemes.Tax relief is available for tuition fees paid by students who are attending certain third level colleges. Such students, or their parents, as appropriate, can avail of tax relief, at the standard rate, on tuition fees paid in respect of part-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in such colleges, provided that both the college and the course satisfy the prescribed Codes of Standards and are approved by the Minister for Education and Science.Further details and conditions in relation to tax relief are available from each individual's local tax office.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	900	As the Deputy will be aware, the National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for investment of €252m in the ICT in Schools Programme and I will be publishing a comprehensive new strategy for ICT in Schools covering the period to 2013. The new strategy will aim to develop an e-Learning culture in our schools that will ensure that ICT usage is embedded in teaching and learning across the curriculum.I have recently announced the appointment of a Strategy Planning Group to advise me on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment over the period of the NDP. Among the issues which the new strategy will address will be the provision of software and digital content for learning. It will also address teacher professional development, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools, technical maintenance and support requirements and the upgrading and renewal of hardware.  I have asked the Strategy Planning Group to look at the critical success factors for those schools that are successfully integrating ICT into their teaching and learning and to take account of the full range of educational supports and funding available to further the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.The Strategy Planning Group is chaired by Mr Jerome Morrissey, Director of the National Centre for Technology in Education and its membership comprises individuals with a range of complementary experiences and expertise in education, industry and the public service. It is expected that the Group will report in May.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	901	The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following table:School YearNumber of Posts2002/03Nil2003/0432004/0552005/0672006/0715
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	902	I wish to advise the Deputy that the information sought in respect of the number of newly appointed resource teachers in each of the past five years in schools in County Donegal is not readily available in my Department.As the Deputy is aware, there has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.My Department implemented a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to all mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs and those with learning support needs.Pupils assessed as having low incidence disabilities, such as autism, may be eligible for an individual allocation of resource teaching hours following submission of an application by the school to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO).At primary level, there are now more than 5,500 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to approximately 1,500 in 1998.At second level, approximately 1,878 whole time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 533 whole time equivalent learning support teachers in our second level schools.The Deputy will also be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from my Department in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/special needs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	903	There are currently 264 Special Need Assistants (whole-time equivalents) employed in primary schools in County Donegal.As the Deputy is aware, there are over three thousand two hundred primary schools in the country. The compilation of information regarding the number of SNAs appointed to individual schools would require an inordinate amount of administrative time in my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	904	Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The details for the current school year (2006/2007) are currently being compiled by my Department and the information requested is not readily available.As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 5,000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Furthermore, the Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006/07 school year compared to 170 in 2005/06.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.But we are determined to go even further, and so the 2007 Estimates include provision for another 800 primary teachers. About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which includes our commitment to reduce class sizes.I assure the Deputy that we will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing going forward. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	906	I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers has applied to the Department for additional accommodation.  The Long term Projected Staffing has recently been re-examined in light of the projected demographics of the area and has been increased to a Principal plus 12 Mainstream Teachers from a Principal plus 8 mainstream teachers.  Progress on the proposed project for the school is now being considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	907	Our current system of school management has served us well. It means that communities have a strong role in how schools are run and that Patrons can ensure that their ethos is promoted in their schools.   I know that such a locally-based system places a lot of responsibility on voluntary members of boards and I am anxious to ensure that members of boards are provided with the training and other supports that they need to discharge their responsibilities.The Department has provided funding to the various school management bodies to enable them to provide training for their boards of management. Since last year, the Drumcondra Education Centre has had responsibility for offering training for boards of management to meet their identified needs.  Areas covered by this training include legal issues, financial management, bullying and child protection.While members of Boards have a responsibility to ensure that procedures are in place within the school to keep their pupils safe and to investigate any allegations of abuse, they are not personally liable for claims against the school.  The Education Act specifically protects individual members from being sued.  It is important that there is local responsibility and vigilance in relation to child abuse but of course this does not mean volunteer members of boards being exposed to claims.  Nor do I believe that this issue will stop people from volunteering to participate on boards.While the courts have found that the State was not liable for cases of child abuse in schools, nonetheless the Government is determined to ensure that all schools have policies and procedures in place to protect their pupils. Over the past number years, a range of measures have been put in place to ensure that this is the case.The Department has provided a range of supports and guidance to schools in the implementation of child protection policy.  Child protection guidelines and procedures, based on Children First — the Department of Health & Children's national guidelines, have been issued to all primary and post-primary schools.These guidelines make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the HSE in dealing with such cases. The Department has provided an extensive in-service training programme for school principals and teachers to assist them in dealing with child protection issues and in implementing these guidelines.Procedures have also been introduced, based on Children First, for Departmental staff to assist them in dealing with any allegations or complaints of abuse which are made to them. Under these procedures, the existences of allegations of abuse are notified directly to the HSE and all allegations of abuse received in the Department are treated with the utmost seriousness.A range of other initiatives have been put in place, including the Stay Safe programme, Social, Personal and Health Education and Internet Safety guidelines —  all with a view to educating students in relation to issues of personal health, well being and safety.In addition, from the beginning of the 2006/2007 academic year, all new teachers and other ancillary staff who have unsupervised access to children are subject to Garda vetting.  Vetting will be broadened to include all 55,000 serving teachers over the next few years.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	916	My Department has not received representations referred to in the Question, which I understand is a private residential development.The developer of a residential estate is statutorily required to complete this development in accordance with the terms of the planning permission and a development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is unauthorised development.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action where a development requiring planning permission has not obtained permission, or where permission has not been complied with.Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers.   The Act also contains other relevant provisions in relation to the completion of housing estates:Sections 34(4)(g) and 180(2)(b) of the Act provide that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development, and, if the development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the security to that satisfactory completion.Section 160 of the Act provides that a planning authority may apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for an order requiring that a development be carried out in accordance with the permission.It is clear therefore that planning authorities have very substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permissions.The 2000 Act also imposed new duties on planning authorities in the enforcement area.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to any unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development), no matter how it becomes aware of it.  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority's decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.Accordingly if the residents consider that this estate has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission, they should make a written complaint to the planning authority, who, as stated above, are obliged to follow up such complaints.Section 180 of the Planning Act provides that where estates have not have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the residents of the estate, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.  The decision as to whether to take the estate in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.

The initial selection of projects to be submitted under this scheme is a matter for local authorities. Kilkenny County Council submitted six applications for consideration. Three schemes prioritised by the Council received allocations, totalling €3,100,000, in 2007. The Council's application for funding for a relief road at Thomastown did not, however, receive an allocation.My Department will again be seeking applications under the Specific Improvements Grant scheme later this year and it will be open to Kilkenny County Council to prioritise and submit an application for consideration for funding in 2008 under this scheme.

The wastewater treatment plant for Killybegs will be procured under a single Design/Build/Operate contract that also includes Bundoran, while the collection system and outfall will be procured under a separate traditional style contract.  My Department is awaiting the submission of Contract Documents by Donegal County Council for both elements of the scheme.

The new treatment plant became operational in September 2003 and was fully commissioned in 2005.  Grants amounting to some €9.1 million have been recouped by my Department to the Council in respect of the scheme.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	922	In recent years local authorities have notified my Department of suspected cryptosporidium infection of water supplies in Carlow, Ennis, Mullingar and Roscommon.  No evidence of such infection was subsequently found in the Carlow or Roscommon supplies.My Department has issued detailed guidance to all local authorities on minimising the risk of cryptosporidium in water supplies.  The guidance was prepared in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency and, inter alia, covers source protection, monitoring, treatment processes, storage and distribution and responding to an outbreak.In November 2004, the National Disease Surveillance Centre published the Report of the Waterborne Cryptosporidiosis Sub-Committee which has also been circulated to local authorities. This report provides comprehensive analysis of the cryptosporidium issue, together with recommendations in relation to prevention of waterborne cryptosporidiosis and incorporates a risk assessment model for use by sanitary authorities.Where a significant capital works programme is required to respond to a cryptosporidium risk, funding is provided by my Department under the Water Services Investment Programme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	923	My Department set up a Working Group on Management Companies/Taking in Charge of Estates which considered the question of responsibility for the maintenance of common shared facilities (roads, sewerage, footpaths, public lighting, large open spaces, smaller landscaped open spaces, car-parking, etc) in residential estates, including the newer type of mixed high-density estate.  The Group has now completed its work and it is intended to issue guidance shortly to planning authorities based on the outcome of its deliberations.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	924	According to returns supplied to my Department for the Annual Planning Statistics 2005, a total of 6,419 warning letters were issued by planning authorities in 2005, 2,667 enforcement cases were initiated, 948 enforcement cases were complied with, a further 105 convictions were achieved and planning authorities have the remainder in hands. Section 154 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the timeframes for dealing with enforcement notices under the Act.In relation to staffing, the Annual Statistics indicate that 275 staff were engaged in planning enforcement in planning authorities in 2005. There are no proposals with my Department from local authorities for the employment of additional staff in relation to planning compliance.The Draft Development Management Guidelines, which will be finalised and published shortly, advise local authorities that adequate staff, financial and other resources should be allocated to ensuring that compliance with the development plan and planning conditions are given the importance that they deserve.   It is a matter for the manager of each local authority, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he/she is responsible, subject to overall Government policy on the control and regulation of numbers in the public sector, including local authorities, announced in the Minister for Finance's Budget statement of 7 December 2005.  I am continuing to keep the overall employment position in the sector under regular review, having regard to the need to deliver quality front line services and achieve value for money within the parameters of Government policy on public service employment generally.The Planning and Development Act 2000 gave substantial additional powers to planning authorities in the enforcement area. These were further supplemented by provisions in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which empowers planning authorities to refuse permission to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous planning permission and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he wishes to apply to have this decision overturned.  I am therefore satisfied that local authorities have adequate resources and powers to take required action in such cases.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-28 00:00:00	Prelude	926	Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles (ELVs) sets out specific measures to be put in place by EU Member States in relation to the collection, storage, treatment, dismantling, reuse and recycling of end-of-life vehicles.  Under the Directive, each Member State is required, inter alia, to ensure that all end-of-life vehicles are dismantled, treated and recovered at no cost to the final holder/owner of that vehicle and in a manner that does not cause environmental pollution.Enabling legislative provisions were included in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 — which inserts a new part in the Waste Management Act 1996 — to facilitate the development of regulations concerning implementation of the Directive. The Waste Management (End-of-Life Vehicles) Regulations 2006, which came into effect on 8 June 2006, fully transpose the provisions of the Directive in Ireland and have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.Any facility wishing to operate as an authorised treatment facility for the collection and storage and treatment of end-of-life vehicles is required to hold a permit in accordance with the Waste Management (Permit) Regulations 1998 or, as appropriate, a waste licence in accordance with the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004.   The consideration of applications for waste permits and the decision making process in relation to the granting of waste permits, as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements of the regulations, is a matter for the relevant local authority and my Department has no function in the matter.  The licensing of relevant waste facilities is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, which is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions in this regard.
