In view of the importance of this issue, I hope the Chair will agree to my request.

The Government's emergency action should include making additional resources available to ensure sufficient numbers of social workers are attached to safe accommodation and located at Dublin Airport and ensuring ample resources are channelled into the Garda operation SNOW.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	16	It is not agreed to.  What was presented on Tuesday and again this morning represents a travesty of democracy.  We are being asked this morning to approve motions on changes to the orders of reference of select committees such that "11 members", as originally intended, would become "13 members" in two instances only in order to accommodate one party political representation in this House.  I have no objection to that in principle but I must insist on parity of esteem and equality of treatment of all elected voices and parties in this Chamber, including Independent Deputies.  We are being asked, in relation to the appointment of members of committees, to approve lists of representatives of the various parties in this House.  This process has been deeply flawed from the beginning.  Responsibility for it rests in the first instance with the Government, specifically the Chief Whip and his office.With all respect, the catalyst for the confusion and gamesmanship that has been taking place with regard to the appointment of committee members and access to committees has been the presentation of the 6:4:1 formula whereby every committee has six Government members, four Fine Gael members and one Labour Party member.  This outrageous proposition totally ignored the right of smaller parties and Independents to take up their rightful places as members of committees.  This is not something to smirk about — it is a very serious matter.  Any examination or scrutiny of the working of democracy in this Chamber will be judged on how the smaller groupings are treated.  That is a fact.  It is a great disappointment to me.  It only fuels the sense that the larger parties are able to carry on as they like because little attention is paid to them.  I appeal to the media to examine factually what has been happening here.  That the media has not informed the citizens of Ireland about what is happening in respect of this issue represents a fundamental failure on its part.It has been proposed to appoint a few Deputies to three committees and many Deputies to two committees.  One of Sinn Féin's four Deputies has not been offered membership of or access to any committee.  I understand that the same thing has happened to another Deputy.  I have represented my party as Sinn Féin's health spokesperson in this Chamber for many years.  I indicated to the Chief Whip and the various representatives of the other main Opposition parties — Fine Gael and the Labour Party — that it is my earnest wish to serve as a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, but I have not been accommodated.  Instead, "champions of health issues" from my constituency are being given access to the committee, to my exclusion.  There are just three Opposition health spokespersons in this Chamber — Deputies James Reilly and Jan O'Sullivan and myself.  It is intolerable that I am not being given an opportunity to play a full role, in tandem with the two Deputies I have mentioned, in challenging the Government on its record of failure on health.

It is a travesty and totally undemocratic.  There is no way we will support the processing of these two motions without amendment.  I have tabled an amendment this morning.

I do not believe that all Members from the coalition parties that make up the Government are in favour of the way this business is being pushed through the House.  I honestly believe that certain Deputies on the Government benches do not believe this represents fair play, justice or democracy.  It is none of those things.  We cannot and will not support this proposal.  I urge Deputies of all parties, Government and Opposition, who have any sense of fair play to take a stand and to accept they cannot railroad through these motions in their private interests, to the exclusion of democratically elected voices whose rights and mandates are the equal of every other Deputy.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	59	In light of the closure of two solicitors' offices which were involved in substantial property dealings in the recent past, has the Minister for Finance received a report from the Financial Regulator on this matter?  Is the Minister concerned at reports that further solicitors' offices may be scrutinised by the Law Society which is a very serious matter?Arising from the latest revelation that senior officials were made aware of the intention of Aer Lingus to decide to move slots from Shannon to Belfast, will the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach make statements to the House as to their knowledge of this decision?Does the Government intend to introduce a working early warning system to ensure that when information such as this comes to light it is transmitted to the Ministers concerned?  It seems that Ministers hear nothing and in many cases, do nothing and in almost all cases, see nothing.  Will those guidelines be issued under the Public Service Management Act 1997?  For the information of the Ceann Comhairle, the guidelines for Ministers on the implementation of the Public Service Management Act 1997, which were issued by the public service modernisation section of the Department of the Taoiseach in 2002, require Ministers to ensure that appropriate strategies and systems are in place.  The guidelines state these strategies and systems are to account to Dáil Éireann for the administration of a Department and other functions.Two weeks ago, on the day after Mr. Justice Carney made his remarks on victim impact statements, the Tánaiste stated on the Order of Business that the Government had no plans to change the law in respect of victim impact statements.  On the same day, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform contradicted him and stated he was contemplating changing the law.  Which is it?  Will changes be made in respect of victim impact statements?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	68	What is the precedent for this?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	70	These guidelines were issued by the Department of the Taoiseach.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Public Service Management Act 1997 is an Act of the House.  It is legislation.  My question is with regard to the implementation of this legislation.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is in existence.  It is not promised legislation.  If Deputy Kenny wants to ask about a possibility of it being amended, which was promised, that is a different matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	75	This is about effective implementation of legislation which the House has passed.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Or lack of it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Arising from this, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste must be accountable to Dáil Éireann for the administration of their Departments.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Certainly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Arising under this Act is the fact that Departments were informed by Aer Lingus well in advance of a decision being made by the chief executive and before the Minister for Transport was informed.  The public and the House need to be told the truth of the extent of their knowledge about this.  I submit this is in order.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Let us be clear that what is in order is business on the Order Paper, the taking of business which has been promised including legislation promised within or outside the Dáil, the making of secondary legislation as I stated yesterday, arrangements for sittings and when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper required in the House will be circulated.  I did not frame the Standing Orders but I must implement them.  Unfortunately, Deputy Kenny must raise this matter in another way and a number of ways exist in which he can.  I will try to facilitate him in doing so but I cannot allow it on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	81	If Members of the Government were interested in telling the truth they would stand up and make a statement about it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Yesterday, we received a letter from the chairman of the Mahon tribunal, informing the House it was his intention to conclude the Quarryvale module public hearings by the beginning of next year and therefore to bring proceedings of the tribunal to a conclusion and issue a report.  As I understand it, the tribunal is a creature of the House.  Will we have an opportunity to discuss the letter sent by the chairman of the tribunal in the House?  Are any motions required to be moved in the House to agree with the contents of the letter?  The tribunal was established by the House and therefore its winding up is also a matter for the House.The Travers report was issued in March 2005 and discussed in the House shortly thereafter.  The report recommended the Civil Service should be aware of, take due cognisance of and be responsive to issues of political sensitivity and ensure Ministers are fully briefed on all factors relevant to politically sensitive issues within the operational remit of Departments.  The Travers report followed the claim by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that he had not read his brief on the nursing homes issue.Given the Taoiseach's undertaking at the time which was given in the House that the recommendations of the Travers report would be taken on board and implemented by the Government, will the Tánaiste explain how it is we read in today's Irish Examiner that the Government Secretary was aware on 27 July of the Aer Lingus decision in respect of Shannon, that the line Department was aware of it six weeks earlier and that nobody in the Government was told about it?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Ceann Comhairle ruled on a different matter.  I am raising the matter of a report commissioned by the Government at the time and debated in the House.  As I recall, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking to the House that the recommendations of the Travers report would be implemented by Government.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It means nothing.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	86	After all this, the Government expects us to believe that experienced civil servants, who regardless of the Travers report are conscious of politically sensitive matters, did not tell a Government Minister about the Shannon decision.  The Government Secretary and the line Department knew it.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is a cover up.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The Government is engaged in a political conspiracy to cover up what was known about Shannon.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I ruled already on this matter.  The matter of the tribunal is marginal but it is probably okay as it brings up business conveyed in a letter from the tribunal.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The benefit of the doubt.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Ceann Comhairle should ask the video referee.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I will stay in order but I reject the assertion made by the leader of the Labour Party.  With regard to the matter of the tribunal, the question of winding it up is a matter for the chairman.  We had motions for its establishment and for its independence in its functions.  It is responsible for its own operations.  I am not aware that motions are required in the Dáil to wind up the tribunal.  I will seek clarification and communicate with the Deputy.  I do not recall any such motions before the House in respect of other tribunals.  I note what the Deputy stated on the content of the letter.  I have not seen the letter but I welcome that it seems we are coming to the end of proceedings and I respect the chairman's views with regard to this.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	95	When the tribunal wrote to the House on previous occasions on matters of significance with regard to its continuance we had discussion in the House.  Usually such discussion was on foot of a motion tabled by the Minister with responsibility for the environment.  My recollection is that the last time we discussed this a formula was agreed for the conclusion of the tribunal's work.  As I read it, the letter from the chairman of the tribunal, while it is in line with what was previously agreed, goes further than what was previously agreed.  The previous agreement of the House anticipated that the tribunal would investigate matters beyond the Quarryvale module.  I submit to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and it is a matter to which we can return next week, that when the tribunal writes to the House, which established the tribunal, saying it is going to conclude its business and setting down arrangements and a timetable for the preparation of its report and submission of that report to the House, that correspondence needs to be discussed in the House.  I do not disagree with the Tánaiste that we have reached the point where the House needs to consider the winding up of the Mahon tribunal but it is a matter that needs to be discussed in the House.  I ask that this issue be looked at between now and next week and we can return to it next week.  The correspondence from the Mahon tribunal needs to be discussed here in the House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Deputy Gilmore will be aware that the tribunal does not need the House to outline its own deadline.  The relationship between the tribunals and the Houses of the Oireachtas is largely governed by statute but certainly Deputy Gilmore can return to the matter next week.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Can the Tánaiste give us some idea as to when we can expect the long promised judicial council Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I understand it will be in 2008.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	99	When can we expect publication of the national monuments Bill to come before the House to protect our heritage infrastructure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Again, I understand that will be next year.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I wish to raise two items.  During Question Time on Tuesday, the Taoiseach said there were 120,000 people working in the Health Service Executive.  On the same day I received a written reply from the Minister stating there are 130,000 people working in the Health Service Executive.  When can we have a full debate on this shambles in order that we know what is happening?

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The second issue relates to the heinous brutal murder of Paul Quinn.  Last night the question was asked here if other Bills would be brought before the House to allow the Garda and other forces to deal with this matter.  Will the criminal justice miscellaneous provisions Bill be discussed in the House soon or is there other planned legislation to improve the ability of the Garda to deal with such an outrageous and heinous murder?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The heads of the criminal justice miscellaneous provisions Bill have been approved by the Government and the first draft is under consideration.  That Bill is expected this session.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	107	When can we expect the health information Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The health information Bill will be published next year.  Probably the best figures to seek are wholetime equivalents.

This is a Bill to enable tenants of local authority apartments to have the same rights when buying out their residences as people in conventional housing.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I understand that Bill is not listed.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	112	If we get the correct name of the Bill we will communicate with the Deputy.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I think it is the social housing miscellaneous provisions Bill.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Last year there was promised legislation in the form of the postal services Bill and the Taoiseach claimed that it fell off the wagon.  I do not know if anybody saw it falling off the wagon but it was necessary and promised legislation at the time.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	115	It did not fall off the wagon on the Order of Business.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	116	To ensure an adequate postal service all over the country, including the kingdom of Kerry, will the Tánaiste give an indication as to whether it is intended to seek out the present location of that Bill and put it back on the wagon?  Meanwhile post offices are being closed all over the country surreptitiously while no direction, in terms of policy, is emanating from Government.  Will it be put back on the wagon again?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	117	On the legislation, minus the wheels.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Only only wheel on the wagon.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Is it the intended practice of the Government in this Dáil to allow a period of two weeks between publication of a Bill and commencement of Second Stage?  Specifically, in regard to the student support Bill, which is on the pink list and scheduled to be published this session, will the Tánaiste indicate whether it is ready for printing and when it will be circulated?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	121	So far as it is possible or practicable, certainly it is always best to give appropriate notice between publication and the taking of a Bill.  As the Deputy will be aware sometimes there are occasions when that is not possible, due to the urgency of a Bill coming through or whatever.  In regard to the student support Bill, which is a Bill to place all student support schemes on a statutory footing and to designate VECs as awarding authorities to provide for a system of appeals and penalties for fraudulent applications for grants and to repeal the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968-92, I understand there are some outstanding issues from the amalgamation of the existing schemes and the Department is seeking to ensure a smooth transition from the existing schemes to the new arrangements.  It is hoped the Bill will be published this session.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	122	In light of an apparent difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the matter of handling the crime crisis where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appears to adopt a wait and see approach and the Taoiseach has indicated that changes might be forthcoming to the composition of the criminal courts, is legislation envisaged to reform the criminal courts?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	131	No, there was no promised legislation.  My recollection is that the Taoiseach, in the House, indicated his concerns, quite rightly, in regard to some of the heinous crimes that have taken place.  Obviously the question of what further legislative or other measures should be taken is a matter of continuing consideration by the Minister and the Government at all times.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	132	In that regard I ask the Tánaiste to convey to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the very serious nature of the situation.  Could, perhaps, a Cabinet sub-committee meet to ensure the Taoiseach and his Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can deal with an apparent difference of opinion?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	133	We cannot debate the matter now.  The Deputy can table a priority question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I welcome the fact the Government has set up a new committee to deal with climate change and energy security.  Obviously this is of considerable importance to business and everybody in the country.  We have not yet seen the terms of reference for that committee.  I suggest that before those terms of reference are drafted for this committee, that discussions take place with the other parties in the House on the extent of what that committee may be able to deal with.  It is a fundamentally important issue and I would like to think the terms of reference would be discussed by the parties before being adopted, in order that the committee can give of its best on what is a really important issue.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	135	That is a matter that can be addressed in the context of Whips' meetings.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	139	It is to provide for a new scheme of financial support for persons requiring residential care in public and private nursing homes.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am very pleased to present to this House today the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007.  It is a short but important Bill, not only for the criminal offences it will introduce into Irish law but for the very clear message it will send out on our determination to ensure that Ireland does not become a destination or transit point in the evil trade of trafficking in human beings.The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce specific criminal offences of trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation or for the removal of their organs.  Legislation in the area of human trafficking already in place is largely designed to deal with smuggling of human beings, as contained in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, and trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, as contained in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.This Bill is a further step in the fight against trafficking in human beings.  From the outset, I emphasise that trafficking in human beings is being tackled at several levels.  First and most important, because it underpins the other initiatives taking place, is the criminal law.  Second are the immigration issues that may be raised when persons are trafficked.  Third are the services provided to trafficked persons and the necessary protection which is given to them.  Fourth are the Garda operations aimed at apprehending the traffickers and the international co-operation with other police forces and agencies, which is essential to successfully deal with such a transnational crime. Throughout my speech I will refer to the many initiatives that are being taken to provide a holistic approach to trafficking.In this Bill I propose to deal with the criminal law aspects of human trafficking.  The provisions of the Bill are extracted from the General Scheme of the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill 2006.  In addition to trafficking issues, that general scheme also contained provisions relating to the protection of children from sexual exploitation.  I have decided to proceed without those provisions to expedite the drafting, publication and enactment of the trafficking provisions.The provisions protecting children have not been forgotten.  They will likely form the basis of further legislation but will be expanded to take account of recommendations in the Report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection.  I also intend to bring the legislation underpinning the sex offenders register more into line with that in our neighbouring jurisdictions and to further strengthen the legislation on sexual grooming in the light of continuing developments in technology.Shortly after my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I stated that bringing forward legislation in the area of human trafficking would be a priority for me and I am pleased to now be in a position to do so at such an early date.  Creating offences criminalising the trafficking in persons for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs will enable the Garda to deal more effectively with the trafficking of human beings into, through or out of the State and to co-operate more fully with other police forces in apprehending the international gangs that are often involved in such trafficking.  Human trafficking takes many different forms.  It is dynamic and adaptable and, like many other forms of criminal activity, it is constantly changing to defeat efforts by law enforcement agencies to prevent it.  The responses to the problem are also rapidly evolving.  International co-operation, which is so crucial to the success of most interventions against human trafficking, is gaining new momentum and new co-operation mechanisms are being developed.  Recently, I announced further initiatives to deal with other aspects of this phenomenon and I will return to these initiatives later.Before turning to the detail of the Bill, I wish to make clear that I consider trafficking in human beings an abhorrent crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.  It is a crime which involves multiple actors, including recruiters, facilitators of transportation and fraudulent employment opportunities, exploiters and end beneficiaries of so-called goods and services provided and produced by trafficked persons.  While most persons' idea of trafficking would be of ruthless international gangs, that is not always the reality.  The profits from trafficking in persons are in the same league as profits from drug trafficking and the smuggling of weapons but it is a well established fact that the recruiters are sometimes women who are neighbours, friends or even members of the family of the unfortunatevictim.This year marks the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade in the former British Empire.  Trafficking in persons has been described as a form of modern day slavery and I want to send a clear message.  The criminal trading of people, as commodities, for whatever purpose, has no place in a modern Ireland.  This form of modern day slavery is an evil crime with no regard by the perpetrators for the human or social consequences.  It is known that traffickers exploit the desire of the individual to have a better life.  They prey on those who are vulnerable because of poverty or other social reasons, they deceive people into travelling with the promise of a better life.  Instead, the victims often find themselves trapped and unable to leave exploitative and abusive circumstances.  They become commodities who are moved, bought and sold to maximise profits.  It is a multi-billion dollar business.  The United Nations and other experts estimate the total market value of illicit human trafficking at $32 billion, and of this an estimated $10 billion is derived from the initial sale of individuals, with the remainder representing the estimated profits from the activities or goods produced by victims of this barbaric crime.It is a crime that is transnational, almost by definition, and can best be understood in an international context.  The European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations have all prepared instruments addressing this issue.  The criminal law provisions of the following instruments have been taken into account in drafting this Bill: the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings; the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings; the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; and the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.Ireland was involved in the negotiations on these international instruments and will continue to fulfil its obligations to participate in the activities of many international organisations against human trafficking.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána are currently participating in meetings of the European Union, Council of Europe, the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe alliance against trafficking and the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre.The Government is committed to tackling this crime and recognises the need to draw together all the work that is being done across the various Departments and agencies.  While there is no evidence of an appreciable human trafficking problem in Ireland, any level of this crime is deplorable.  Due to its clandestine and criminal nature, accurate statistics on the magnitude of the human trafficking problem are elusive.  The office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons at the State Department in Washington estimates that 800,000 people are trafficked worldwide each year.  International experts estimate that some 2.5 million people throughout the world are at any given time recruited, entrapped, transported and exploited.  The United Nations office on drugs and crime reports that trafficking in persons, whether for sexual exploitation or forced labour, affects virtually every region of the world.  Data taken from the database on human trafficking trends document the trafficking of human beings from 127 countries to be exploited in 137 countries.I mentioned that trafficking into Ireland is not a significant problem.  However, it is a potential problem and could grow without remedial action.  Recent research suggests that a minimum of 76 women were probably trafficked into Ireland in the past seven years.  This is 76 too many and is indicative of a small but growing problem.  Among the difficulties in calculating the true number of persons trafficked into Ireland are the different definitions used to describe trafficking and confusion in the differences between trafficking and smuggling.  The definition of trafficking in the Bill will provide a standard internationally recognised meaning of trafficking in human beings.  It can be distinguished from smuggling in persons as follows.  Smuggling will always involve illegal border crossings with false or stolen documents.  It is always voluntary and is ultimately a crime against the State.  Trafficking can involve legal or illegal border crossings or even no border crossings.  Documents may also be genuine or forged and will usually be taken from the victim by someone in the trafficking network.  Coercion and repeated exploitation are usual with restrictions on and control of the victim's movements.  It is a crime against the individual.  What trafficking and smuggling have in common is that they are profitable criminal enterprises involving human beings and carried out by criminal networks.Trafficking offences are difficult to prosecute for some of the same reasons that they are difficult to investigate.  Due to the nature of the offence, the frequent need to rely on evidence collected abroad and the potential for victims and witnesses to be traumatised and intimidated, the prosecution of these offences offers new and difficult challenges.  However, absence of reliable statistics does not justify inaction in response to the problem and enhanced international collaboration and the development of stronger witness protection measures must be part of any strategy to address these challenges.Outlining the Government's strategy to deal with human trafficking, I recently announced other measures being taken to tackle this sordid crime.  It is necessary to adopt a holistic approach to the issue and deal with human trafficking comprehensively.  A new high level group on combating trafficking in human beings is being established.  This group is tasked with presenting to me the most appropriate and effective response to dealing with trafficking in human beings.  The group will consist of representatives of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána and other Departments and offices who have contributions to make to the national response.  The committee will decide on the most appropriate way to engage constructively with the NGOs and other interested parties to ensure the most effective response to this crime.  The NGO community will have an important role to play, particularly in the provision of services to victims.A national action plan to combat trafficking in human beings will be drafted by the high level group.  It is envisaged that the plan will be drafted under four main headings; prevention of trafficking and awareness raising, prosecution of traffickers, protection of the victim and the response to child trafficking.  The key goal of the national action plan will be that Ireland has the appropriate legislative and administrative structures in place to allow for the adoption or ratification of all relevant international instruments.  Last week, on the first EU day against trafficking in human beings, my Department launched a public consultation process to obtain the views of thepublic on what should be included in the action plan.It is also my intention to include provisions in the forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007 which will strengthen the protections available to victims of human trafficking.  In particular, it is my intention to provide the necessary framework whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State.  It is intended that this period will allow the victim time to heal and recover from his or her experience and also the opportunity to escape the influence of those who engage in human trafficking.  In addition, this period will allow the victim time to come to a decision on whether he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter and, in circumstances where he or she so wishes, a further period of residence in the State will be granted to enable him or her to do so.The Garda National Immigration Bureau will continue to deploy whatever resources are necessary to counteract the problem of human trafficking.  That office and my Department are co-operating with the UK agencies on Operation Pentameter 2, which was launched earlier this month in London.  This is a co-ordinated campaign of law enforcement activity to tackle the trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation into the UK.  Due to the land border and the common travel area, co-operating with and contributing to such operations makes practical sense.  Officers from the Garda Síochána and officials from my Department sit on the operation's gold command team as observers and have developed new contacts throughout the policing and NGO community in the UK.The Garda Síochána continues to fully co-operate with the UK Human Trafficking Centre.  The centre, which is the UK law enforcement response, is quickly becoming a centre of excellence.  This year, officers from the centre have participated in the training of more than 100 gardaí in issues relating to human trafficking and victim identification and care.Ireland has been invited to be part of a European G6 initiative against human trafficking.  This initiative, launched last week, is a co-ordinated international campaign of activity to tackle the trafficking of human beings.  Six European countries are participating, namely, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland.  The initiative is supported by Europol, Interpol and Eurojust.  It is a multi-strand operation marrying strategic policy development with a period of operational policing enforcement activity.  The strands of the initiative include, intelligence gathering, awareness raising, law enforcement operational activity and victim protection.  Ireland will lead the strand on awareness and will host a meeting of the partner countries in Dublin in January next year.  This initiative is designed to ensure the EU becomes a more hostile environment for criminals engaged in trafficking.  It is through initiatives like this, involving practical co-operation between member states of the EU and, Operation Pentameter II which is based on co-operation between the UK and Ireland, that we learn more about the problem of human trafficking in the European Union.  This will help us to develop the necessary domestic structures to ensure that human trafficking does not become a substantial problem here.I would like now to briefly outline to the House some of the main provisions.  Section 2 is a definition section.  The terms "exploitation", "labour exploitation", "sexual exploitation" and "trafficks" are given meanings based on what is required or intended by terms used in the international instruments referred to.Section 3 creates an offence for the trafficking of a child for the purpose of the child's exploitation. "Exploitation" in this section does not include sexual exploitation which was addressed by way of amendment to section 4 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  This section criminalises persons who traffick children for the purpose of labour exploitation or the exploitative removal of their organs.  The causing of an offence or an attempt to commit an offence is also criminalised.  The section provides for a maximum penalty of unlimited fine and-or life imprisonment on conviction on indictment for committing any of the offences in the section.Section 4 substitutes new provisions into the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  It provides a new definition of sexual exploitation which is more in line with the definition of sexual exploitation of adults in section 2 and defines "child" for the purposes of the section as a person under 18 years of age.  Under the 1998 Act, a child was defined as being under 17 years of age.  Raising the age is in line with international norms and is also required by the international instruments on trafficking.Section 5 proposes the creation of an offence in respect of trafficking in persons aged 18 years or over for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of organs.  Currently, there is no specific legislation protecting adults.  A person involved in trafficking would invariably commit other serious offences including, rape, assault, abduction and false imprisonment.  The wording in this section closely follows the wording in the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings which in turn is closely aligned to the wording in the UN protocol which seeks to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children and supplements the convention against transnational organised crime and the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings.The main difference between section 5 and sections 3 and 4 is that while children cannot consent to being trafficked, older persons can.  The international instruments recognise this and, for on offence of trafficking in adults to take place there must be threats, the use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, an abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or, of giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of the person having control over another person.  The concept of adults consenting to being transferred from one jurisdiction to another is controversial but we must accept that adults can give a valid consent and in some cases, as I mentioned already, there is confusion between trafficking and smuggling.This section places mentally impaired persons in the same position as children who are trafficked; consent is not an issue.  The definition of mentally impaired is the same as that contained in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  This definition is used generally in criminal law provisions, particularly those that protect mentally impaired persons against sexual abuse or sexual exploitation.Section 5 also includes the creation of an offence for selling, offering for sale or purchasing a person.  This is not a requirement of any of the international instruments and, while not confined to trafficked persons, it acknowledges that persons can be sold and purchased many times whether en route to or in the destination country resulting in repeated suffering for the trafficked person.  A similar offence in section 3 relates to the selling or purchasing of children.  A person found guilty of any offence under section 5 is liable to a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and-or life imprisonment.  The severe penalties for these offences are an indication of how seriously the Government considers the crime of human trafficking.Section 7 deals with jurisdiction.  Ordinarily, Irish courts accept jurisdiction for offences committed within the jurisdiction. International instruments call for wider jurisdiction provisions, some mandatory, some voluntary.  The provisions contained in section 7 are based on the jurisdictions contained in the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act 1996.  We automatically accept jurisdiction when an offence is committed in the State, including on ships or aircraft registered in the State.  We are also, under this legislation, accepting jurisdiction where an Irish citizen or person ordinarily resident in the State is alleged to have committed a trafficking offence abroad or where a trafficking offence is alleged to have been committed in another country against an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident in the State.Sections 8 and 9 contain standard provisions regarding proceedings relating to offences committed outside the State and double jeopardy.  Section 10 provides for exclusion of members of the public from proceedings.  Trafficked persons can be vulnerable and traumatised and the traffickers and their criminal associates may wish to harm them or members of their families or prevent them from giving evidence.  This provision will give a judge power to exclude from the court persons, other than officers of the court, directly connected with the proceedings or other persons as the judge may determine.  This will ensure a lack of publicity surrounding these cases.  Section 11, which is another protective measure, provides for a guarantee of anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking unless the judge fully or partially waives the anonymity in the interests of justice.  Breach of this section could have serious consequences for the alleged victim.  I consider that any offence under this section should be triable on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of an unlimited fine and-or ten years imprisonment.Section 12 contains another protective measure for alleged victims.  An amendment to the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 will allow an alleged victim of trafficking to give evidence through a live television link with the leave of the court in the case of adults from within the State or abroad.  Section 13 provides for amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001.  Some of these are technical in nature while others are important for the smooth operation of that Act.  An important amendment raises the maximum penalty for non-compliance with the notification obligations in that Act, the sex offenders register as it is more usually known.  Failure by a person so obliged to notify the Garda of his or her address, is an offence with a maximum penalty on summary conviction of a fine of €1,905 and-or 12 months imprisonment.  The proposal in this section raises the penalties ensuring that the offence can be tried on indictment.  As an arrestable offence, it will allow the Garda to arrest, on the spot, a person they know not to have complied with the notification requirements.The section also gives power to probation and welfare officers to prosecute persons who fail to comply with the conditions attaching to an order for post-release supervision.  These provisions requested by An Garda Síochána and the probation and welfare service, have been included to ensure smooth running of the Act in respect of notification requirements and post-release supervision.  The amendment to the Bail Act at section 14 adds the offences created in the Bill to the Schedule of that Act.  This means they are serious offences for the purpose of that Act.I mentioned earlier that there has to be an holistic approach to the challenges presented by the international trafficking gangs.  This Bill deals with one response to the challenge — the criminal law response.  The offences are comprehensive, going beyond the requirements of the international instruments but retaining all the essential elements of the meanings given to the terms trafficking, sexual exploitation and labour exploitation contained therein.  This is important in terms of our being in a position to ratify the instruments and for international co-operation.On enactment of this Bill, we will be in full compliance with the EU framework decision on trafficking.  I hope I have adequately explained the other initiatives, legislative, administrative and operational, being taken in tandem with this Bill in order to comprehensively tackle any existing manifestations of trafficking in this country and to prevent any proliferation in trafficking.  As soon as progress is made on the administrative initiatives we will be in a position to ratify the UN protocol.  We will, of course, first have to ratify the parent convention against transnational organised crime.  Also, with the administrative response in place, ratification of the Council of Europe trafficking convention can take place as soon as the immigration, residence and protection Bill is enacted.I look forward to a positive debate.  As the Bill is a crucial part of my response to the cruel trade of trafficking in human beings, I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  Although it has been a long time in coming it is a positive development and I warmly welcome it.Last March saw the 200th anniversary of the end of the transatlantic slave trade.  While the obvious trade may have been abolished two centuries ago, underground modern slave trading is being practised today in almost every country.  The slave trade is now known as human trafficking and ranks with drugs and arms trafficking as one of the most lucrative criminal activities.  It is estimated that €6,400 million per annum is generated in the initial trade itself.The sole purpose of the practice is exploitation and abuse.  The majority of persons who find themselves being trafficked are destined for the sex industry where they are forced into prostitution.  Some are even trafficked to supply human organs.  It is estimated that between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are moved across international borders each year.  According to the United States State Department office to monitor trafficking in persons, 80% of those trafficked are women and girls and up to 50% are children, many of whom are forced into prostitution.  Almost every city, town and village in eastern and central Europe has had some of its girls and women disappear and trafficked abroad for use and abuse.  They have become pawns in the business of money and sex.  Human trafficking is a growing problem within the EU, with more than 100,000 people trafficked across borders each year.  Since 2004, as many as 330 children are known to have been trafficked into the United Kingdom through various routes, but experts feel this is only the tip of the iceberg.  This is a growing business and Ireland is a target country.Human trafficking is not merely a matter of numbers.  It is about human beings, including children, being subjected to unspeakable perversion daily.  Victims of trafficking suffer physical, sexual and psychological trauma.  Frequently, they contract sexually transmitted diseases, having been forced into the sex industry.  We must add to this rape, physical assault, nightmares, insomnia, suicidal tendencies, substance abuse and even suicide and murder.While this may be a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland, the practice of trafficking first came to public consciousness with the tragic events in Wexford and Waterford in December 2001, which culminated in the death of eight people trapped inside a freight container.  Two centuries ago, there were slave ships but then, at least, everyone knew what those slave ships were and what they were doing.  Now, trafficking is much more covert.  A trafficked child could be sitting next to one on a commercial ferry crossing or flight and one would have absolutely no idea.Ruhama is an organisation that provides support services to women involved in prostitution and other forms of commercial exploitation.  The vast majority of the 132 women it had helped up to the end of 2006 came from eastern European countries such as Albania and Romania.  Other regions of origin include South America, Asia and Africa, where one fifth of those being trafficked originate.  The International Organisation for Migration has assisted women victims of trafficking, including children, to return voluntarily from Ireland to their countries of origin, including Romania, Moldova, Croatia, Brazil, Nigeria, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.It is reasonable to assume that many more times this number of trafficked women have entered the country.  The difficulty is that they are largely invisible.  They are kept behind closed doors in apartments, brothels and massage parlours.  It is impossible to put an accurate figure on this illegal trade as victims often remain unseen and the criminal gangs who operate as traffickers use coercive tactics, such as constantly moving women around the country, threats or actual physical violence and threats of deportation.  Early this month it was reported that the Garda is investigating a number of cases of forced marriage involving migrant children as young as 12 years.  The young girls were, typically, trafficked into the country and coerced into marrying older men from migrant communities.Ireland has also been pinpointed as a major route for trafficking children, doomed to a life of slavery or prostitution in Britain.  Traffickers will always find the weakest link and reports have highlighted the fact that in Ireland they have discovered one of the easiest ways to the United Kingdom.  A recent BBC documentary interviewed a trafficker who admitted smuggling children through Rosslare into the United Kingdom.  It is not only the UK media who have exposed this issue in Ireland.  Last year, our own "Prime Time" highlighted evidence of young people being illegally trafficked into the country and forced to work in the sex industry, suffering serious physical and sexual abuse.To date, neither the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 nor the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 have resulted in a successful prosecution for the crime of trafficking, although individuals have been arrested and charged.  This is in contrast with other countries which have had successful prosecutions.  The problem lies with the present legislative code which is not strong enough to facilitate successful convictions.  Therefore, this legislation is very welcome and a positive step forward as it will, for the first time, impose strict penalties upon those involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of people where coercion or force are involved, particularly for the purposes of labour or sexual exploitation.Human trafficking is not only an issue of organised crime.  We must take into full account the vulnerability of the victims.  The structures must be in place to ensure that the Garda act with sensitivity and recognise them as victims and not just as witnesses to crime.  At present there is no clear policy or guidelines as to what happens to women who have been identified as having been trafficked for sex.  A purely criminal law response will not deal with the issue of human trafficking and we must address the issue of victim protection and assistance.The Minister stated that the Bill will "enable the State to comply with the relevant victim protection provisions in the Council of Europe Convention".  However, he failed adequately to address the fact that the convention is very comprehensive on protection provisions and explicitly stipulates that many of the provisions for protection are not only necessary but mandatory.  This fundamental issue is completely ignored in the legislation.  The Minister also stated that, in the context of the treatment of victims, it is his intention that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings.  What does this mean?  A framework does not have any legal basis.  At present, protection of victims is ad hoc, sometimes offered by non-governmental organisations and sometimes by the Garda National Immigration Bureau on a case by case basis. There is, however, no co-ordinated multi-agency response to assist victims of trafficking.Last week's report by NUI Galway highlighted one case of a woman who was found by gardaí in a private brothel in Sligo.  She was believed to have been trafficked and was brought to Mountjoy jail.  She was the one criminalised.  The Bill is silent on this fundamental issue. There is a very real danger that the Bill will criminalise the victims unless clear protections are included in the Act.  For the first time, the Government is being tested on its commitment to integration.  I welcome the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for integration.  However, the Bill includes nothing to deal with the issues of victims or integration.  The Government has failed its first test.This is important if the public is to support the sympathetic treatment of victims of trafficking but also for the victims themselves, whose self-esteem is low enough without being branded as freeloaders, so that their claims are taken seriously.  By adopting a sensible and practical application of a temporary residency system with clear qualifying criteria, abuse of such a system should not follow.  Without these protections clearly and expressly enshrined in the Bill for victims, they will not come forward to the Garda authorities.  This is fundamental to securing convictions against those directly involved in this trade.Even without the possibility of successful prosecutions, the NUI Galway report found that of the 76 women who had been trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation between 2000 and 2006, 36 had no recent contact with support agencies, 12 remained in the asylum system and ten were granted leave to stay in Ireland or were given refugee status.  It is imperative that these victims are not viewed as illegal immigrants who should be sent home as soon as prosecutions are secured.  If the Government does this, it will further exploit these people.  While permanent residency in this country cannot and should not be guaranteed because it would seriously compromise any successful prosecution, a balance must be struck.First, they must be recognised as victims who need our support and assistance.  It should be remembered our citizens have created the demand for this trade in the majority of instances.  Second, Ireland has signed up to EU Council Directive 2004/81/EC on granting temporary residence permits to trafficked victims.  The objective behind this is to ensure a period of recovery and support before consideration is given to sending that person back to his or her home country.  Third, international conventions clearly and unambiguously state trafficking legislation should provide for victim protection measures, not immigration regulation.  Fourth, the State should grant immediate humanitarian visas for child victims, in line with a call by UNICEF.I refer to the gut-wrenching practice of child trafficking and, in particular, the care of victims in this country once they come to the attention of authorities.  Correspondence between the HSE and the Department of Health and Children in 2005 stated that the executive, which is responsible for separated children seeking asylum, believed the majority of separated children coming into care had been trafficked into the country.  The damning indictment of our present system is that more than 250 separated children had gone missing from HSE accommodation over the previous four years.  It must be assumed that some of these children have been trafficked.  In a Swedish case study, which illustrates the link between vulnerable separated children and trafficking, a total of 50 Chinese separated children went missing from accommodation centres.  However, following the arrest of two Chinese nationals on trafficking charges, no Chinese child has arrived unaccompanied to Sweden.Earlier radio news bulletins reported on the detection of a child trafficking ring in Holland, which involved 19 arrests of suspected traffickers in Holland, Spain, Belgium, Britain, the US and Ireland.  The Garda and other EU police authorities are to be commended on their action regarding this ring.  However, these children were sent to Amsterdam with fake documentation and told to apply for asylum.  It is clear the asylum process in the European Union is being used as a mechanism of abuse and this issue needs to be addressed.  I reiterate UNICEF's comments in this regard.  Having applied for asylum, young girls are then moved from care centres in the UK and Sweden — and Ireland, according to anecdotal evidence — and forced into prostitution.  They have been found on the streets in France, Italy, Spain and Holland.  This is a serious abuse of the rights of children and it must be examined and addressed.Due to the covert nature of trafficking for prostitution, it is increasingly difficult to make contact with victims, many of whom fear imprisonment or deportation.  The Garda is at the coalface in confronting this illegal practice.  Its officers are the key group as they are likely to meet the victims of this trade first hand and it is imperative they are given the resources and training to effectively deal with victims.  I hope the Minister was not paying lip service to this issue in his contribution and resources are provided for the Garda.  Time and again, when the lack of proper equipment and basic training for the Garda is raised, it is passed off that the force has the resources available and it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  However, resources are not delivered to ensure the best equipped and trained police force.In tackling trafficking as a crime, the Garda must be equipped with clear and practical laws and resources and, most important, receive comprehensive training informed by the experiences of police in other jurisdictions and by groups working with victims of trafficking in Ireland.  Ireland must move from a position where those involved in trafficking are engaged in low risk, high profit crime to one in which they engage in high risk, low profit crime.  It must be ensured Ireland and the EU become a harsh environment for traffickers.Human trafficking, which is the world's third biggest crime after arms and drugs, in turn, fuels other criminal activities such as money laundering, drug trafficking and document forgery.  That is why we in Ireland cannot address this issue in isolation.  The issue of forged documentation must be dealt with.  The media reported yesterday that a new border system will be introduced in this jurisdiction and Britain, which will mean people travelling by air and sea between both jurisdictions will be required to carry passports so that information regarding their travel plans and movements is available to the authorities.  However, that will fall flat in on its face similar to the present system because of the use of false Irish passports and driving licences and the poor quality of official documentation, particularly driving licences.  Four years ago the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan, announced he would introduce a watertight system for driving licences but nothing has happened in this regard.  Anyone can purchase a false licence for €10 or €15 and it is farcical to think it is a secure form of identification.  The Government cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this issue.Passports issued through the passport office in Dublin are different from those issued by Irish embassies.  Those issued by embassies are of an inferior quality and they are open to forgery.  With today's technology, I cannot understand why we cannot ensure the same quality of passport issued by the Passport Office in Molesworth Street is issued by our embassies.  That is leading to abuse and the forging of documentation.Also related to forged or false documentation, is the issuing of PPS numbers by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Officials in the Department do not have the available technology to identify false documentation and they have very poor training in spotting such documentation.  We are literally doling out these PPS numbers, which give people access to employment and State services.  Why are we allowing such a significant loophole to exist within the Irish system?The objective behind the introduction of PPS numbers in the first instance was to address the abuse of the social welfare system.  By allowing false documentation to be used, we are facilitating the gross legal abuse of our social welfare and other systems in the country.  This cannot continue, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a responsibility to ensure this practice is tackled and eradicated once and for all.  It is making a farce of PPS numbers.Returning to cross-border co-operation, in 2006 a British House of Commons committee report claimed that Northern Ireland is being used as a back door for smuggling migrants into the Republic of Ireland and Britain itself.  It is therefore imperative we build on the close co-operation currently existing between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána.  To effectively combat human trafficking, authorities must constantly improve their knowledge of what is going on, where it is taking place and how it is proceeding.We must have a co-ordinated approach, both North-South and east-west.  The very nature of international organised crime requires such a response on a transnational level.  This type of co-operation will not be helped by the Government's recent decision to opt out of closer co-operation with other EU police forces.  Traffickers will be assisted by the exclusion of Ireland from tough new Europe-wide anti-crime measures.Ireland has a major interest in working with other member states in tackling cross-border crime in the European Union, including the appalling crimes of child and people trafficking, which clearly affects this country.

We are now being told that common travel area will be virtually abolished, according to media reports.  There is no excuse for not having closer co-operation.  We have back-up systems and vetoes in place if something comes through those proposals which we are not happy to accept.  There is a fall-back system and the protections are already there.The Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been very proactive on the issue to date but this takes it one step further.  I believe it to be the wrong decision.  I understand it may exclude Ireland from new measures which have already been signed up to, including a key European border management database crucial to fighting the illicit trafficking trade.Trafficking is an international problem which requires an international solution so we must urgently embrace EU measures to combat crime.  According to recent reports and media coverage, Ireland is seen as a soft touch for trafficking and our coastline is wide open to smugglers.  The Garda Síochána lacks both the technical resources and manpower to seriously combat organised crime.  Closer co-operation and the sharing of expertise and intelligence with our fellow member states is essential if we are to seriously reduce crime, including the trafficking of people into or through this country.Smuggling is not dealt with in this legislation, nor should it be.  However, there has been no conviction under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 or the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  We must again consider the smuggling of people into this jurisdiction.  It is unacceptable that we have not had prosecutions in this particular area, so I ask the Minister to examine what can be done to strengthen the legislative framework and ensure the Garda has resources to deal with the matter on the ground.  Clearly that is not happening now.  There is no doubt, either with me or in the Minister's Department, that illegal smuggling is happening in this jurisdiction and throughout the European Union.  Why have we not been able to gain convictions?I wish to discuss section 13 of the Bill, which deals with a sex offenders' register.  I welcome this development as our sex offenders' register is failing.  I hope this provision will help to address the matter with regard to those who have been convicted in this jurisdiction.There have been numerous instances of people convicted outside this jurisdiction taking up residency in this country but who are not on the register.  There was a case in my constituency a number of years ago involving an individual convicted in the UK who was providing computer lessons to children in this jurisdiction in a private capacity.  That should not be allowed to happen.On Committee Stage I also wish to consider the media aspect.  I accept the Minister's points on the media and confidentiality, which are sacrosanct.  If we are to eradicate these criminal activities, it is important that the public be made aware of them through increased media exposure.There is provision in other legislation which tends to get the balance right, such as the Criminal Law (Rape)(Amendment) Act 1990.  The Minister should reconsider the matter with a view to ensuring as much information as possible gets out while at the same time maintaining protection for victims.  We can examine the matter on Committee Stage.This legislation is a positive step but it is only the first step.  It does the very minimum to address this appalling practice.  The Government still has to ratify the international treaties on trafficking that it has signed up to.  The Minister has also announced the establishment of a new high-level group on combating trafficking in human beings, which is being established to co-ordinate Ireland's efforts in the area.Why are non-governmental organisations like Ruhama, which are working directly with victims, not part of this group?  This is essential in order to ensure the realities of what is happening on the ground influence the agenda of this group.  One of its key goals is to produce a national action plan, outlining the appropriate legislative and administrative structures to be put in place to allow for ratification of all relevant international instruments.  Yet another report from the Government represents a means to place this important issue on the long finger.The Government has brought forward the legislation to make human trafficking illegal.  However, it has not provided the resources, legal supports or protections for victims to ensure we can adequately stem the flow of this putrid trade.  Now that we have had the window-dressing, let us see real action to show the true colour of the Government's commitment.I commend the Bill to the House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Bill relates to slavery.  Trafficking people for the purpose of exploitation used to be called slavery — that was its definition.  I am sure many people who have not thought about this subject or who live in the kind of environment or social setting in which they never encounter it will be shocked to learn that the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007 is designed to combat what is, in effect, a modern version of slavery.  If people are of the opinion that slavery was a phenomenon that ended in the 19th century, all they need do is read this morning's news headlines relating to the story to which Deputy Naughten referred regarding an international ring engaged in the business of selling young women into sexual slavery being busted.  We know that the women concerned, some of them girls in their teens, are being sold into sexual slavery as a result of their vulnerability, the circumstances that obtain in their countries of origin or the simple fact that they want to make better lives for themselves.  Some young people who attempt to flee poverty or oppression or simply want to improve the conditions in which they live fall into the clutches of the lowest form of criminals, namely, those who are prepared to grow wealthy from trafficking these individuals into prostitution.Ireland is not blameless in this regard.  Those who hanker after the image of the island of saints and scholars must be aware that the latter is not the reality which obtains today.  The Minister's contribution was interesting in that regard.  In it, he dealt with a great deal more than is contained in the Bill.  He was at pains to indicate that the legislation was merely an attempt to deal with this issue from the point of view of the criminal law and that it did not purport to do more than this.  However, he set out to do a good deal more.  He has described the issue we are addressing and outlined its frightening scale, instanced the international instruments that obtain in this area, most of which we have not ratified, and indicated the steps he intends to take to enable us to ratify them outside the context of the Bill.  Ireland is naked in the context of its preparedness to combat this phenomenon in so far as it touches upon our jurisdiction.  There seems to be no doubt but that it does do so.Young women are being trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of prostitution.  Some of them are also being trafficked here for the purposes of forced labour.  I do not call the circumstances relating to domestic service that have been described to me in connection with a couple of cases as anything other than forced labour.  I refer to young women who find themselves in domestic settings where they are grossly exploited in terms of working hours, conditions, etc.  I do not, however, make any moral equivalence between cases of that nature and the main thrust of the Bill, which is to deal with the matter of criminal trafficking for exploitation purposes.  I accept that the selling of young women into the sex industry is a matter of an entirely different character.As I understand it, the nature of prostitution in Ireland has changed dramatically in the past 20 years.  Organisations and experts working with women who find themselves in these circumstances have indicated that the position has changed dramatically during that time.  Up to 20 years ago, the majority of women who walked the streets operated for themselves or even if they owed allegiance to pimps — surely the lowest form of life — their activities were not connected to international crime.  Where they did work for pimps, there were usually no connections to the network of global crime.  At the time to which I refer brothels in this country were an exception and it would have been extremely rare to encounter non-national women in the industry.Deputy Naughten referred to the work being done by organisations in this area, particularly Ruhama which works directly with women trapped in the sex industry.  Ruhama believes the sex industry has become highly organised in recent years and is linked to the global crime network.  The Minister's remarks seem to bear out that assertion.  He describes the nature of this abhorrent criminality and the scale of the industry.  It will be mind-blowing for most law-abiding citizens to learn that, as the Minister stated:The United Nations and other experts estimate the total market value of illicit human trafficking at $32 billion, and of this an estimated $10 billion is derived from the initial sale of individuals, with the remainder representing the estimated profits from the activities or goods produced by victims of this barbaric crime.That is a shocking indictment of the scale of this international criminality.  The Minister also stated:The office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons at the State Department in Washington estimates that 800,000 people are trafficked worldwide each year.  International experts estimate that some 2.5 million people throughout the world are at any given time recruited, entrapped, transported and exploited.  This is abuse on a horrific scale and surely calls on the international community to effectively organise itself in the attempt to combat this criminality.I spoke about the domestic sex industry and how it has changed in recent years.  Of course, information technology is a major contributing factor in that new methods of communication have replaced street walking, as was the traditional way of making contact with clients.  Mobile phones, not to mention Internet advertising, make it easier for pimps and procurers to operate and exploit the young women over whom they have control.What was always, by definition, a very secretive industry has become largely invisible to the busy, law-abiding citizen going about his or her business in this city and other cities and towns throughout the country.  It is now virtually invisible, which is why I wonder about the statistics advanced by the Minister.  I know that when he quoted the figure of 76 women believed to have been trafficked in recent years, he was referring to the research by Dr. Eilís Ward from the Department of Political Science and Sociology in the National University of Ireland, Galway, and Dr. Gillian Wylie from the Irish School of Ecumenics in Trinity College.  This research only came into my possession today.The Minister is accurately quoting from this research because that is what it says in its findings.  However, that figure is contested by, for example, Ruhama, which speaks about directly knowing 200 women in these circumstances and having assisted a good proportion of them.  Ruhama says that the 101 odd women with whom it has been in contact and who found themselves in these circumstances say that they know five or six other women in similar circumstances.  There is some basis for believing that this is only the tip of the iceberg and that because of the invisibility of the sex industry, it is probable that the figures are more serious than those quoted in the research by the two academics referred to by me.Ruhama, which works with people afflicted in these circumstances, admits that it is a small-scale agency which is not particularly well resourced.  It probably cannot meet the expectation that it penetrate every murky corner of this sordid business.  The problem is probably more serious than the figures used today suggest.We know that most of the women being trafficked are very young, often in their late teens, and that they operate from brothels and private apartments in this city and elsewhere throughout the country.  It is fair to say that people and organisations working with the victims of this international crime are broadly welcoming of the Bill introduced to the House today.  I join in that welcome and am glad to see the Bill being brought forward.  However, everybody who has studied the phenomenon says that one cannot deal with it through the criminal law alone and that this will not meet our obligations under the international instruments or provide the redress that might be expected in a civilised jurisdiction for the young women who find themselves in the grasp of this industry.The Minister seemed to acknowledge that in his address to the House today.  While I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone out of his way to put a comprehensive description of what we are dealing with on the record of the House and to set out a number of measures that he intends to take, it must be said that the area we are addressing is relatively narrow and many people attempting to assist women trapped in this industry will be less than satisfied unless the Minister can give us a commitment that the various matters outside the Bill addressed by him will be brought forward within a reasonable timeframe.The Minister said it is intended that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State.  What kind of framework is contemplated by him?  Does it have a statutory basis?  Is it purely a charter of best practice or will it be underpinned by legislation?  Many people outside this House want answers to questions like that.The Minister has given undertakings that some of the critical matters not dealt with in the Bill will otherwise be legislated for.  Committee Stage will give us an opportunity to test that.  It is not entirely clear from the Minister's script how soon we are likely to see such measures and I am not persuaded that the protection of the victim ought to be the subject of another Bill.  Why should these issues be dealt with in the promised immigration and residence Bill?  This is not an aspect of immigration under any conventional definition of that word.  It is an entirely different issue concerning the exploitation of young, vulnerable girls who are trafficked across the world, some of them into this jurisdiction.  The organisations say that any legislation to effectively deal with this must be victim centred and that we ought to address this key issue in this Bill.The Minister concedes that the passing of this Bill will not enable us to ratify, for example, the UN protocol or the parent convention against transnational organised crime.  If one looks at the standards set in the Council of Europe trafficking convention, one can see that this cannot be ratified by the Government until the immigration and residence Bill is enacted.  We are not coming to this legislation with a great track record.  If the work has been done in preparing what, at first glance, seems to be a reasonably comprehensive Bill to deal with the criminal law dimension of this issue, the opportunity is being passed up to take the holistic approach that the Minister argues for in his script but which is not present in the legislation before the House.The Bill, for example, does not deal with the protection of victims, nor does it incorporate the standards set down by the Council of Europe convention.  I am assured by expert opinion that law enforcement can only be effective in this area if there is adequate protection of victims.  There needs to be provision for a period of recovery and reflection.  As Members will be aware, under that convention, 30 days is the recommendation.  Access to temporary residence permits of up to six months is deemed to be necessary.  There is a requirement to recognise that repatriation in those circumstances ought to be voluntary.  The availability of legal aid ought to be specified.I appreciate that we will get an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out some of these issues but it is difficult to deal with them when the Department and the Minister seem to have set their faces against anything other than a criminal law solution in this Bill.  Despite paying lip service in the text to the need for a more holistic approach and given that all the expert opinion and advice of organisations working with women who find themselves entrapped and enslaved in this sordid industry is to take that holistic approach, the Minister and the Department seem to have set their faces against that.  That is regrettable.When the Minister replies to the debate in respect of the high level group he promised to establish, will he indicate whether it is intended that some of the people who have distinguished themselves in bringing this issue to political attention will be included among the membership of that high level group?  I note the array of experts who will be called on but other than that there will be consultation with the NGOs I do not see a commitment that there will be NGO representation on that high level group.  That is a pity because the experience of the streets must be brought to the solutions in regard to this horrific industry.I welcome the fact that the Bill goes out of its way to seek to protect the anonymity of the victim and that is positive.  Returning to the idea of a criminal law solution only, how many loopholes will be discovered because we do not make any provision in the Bill for soliciting or purchase of a service?  It is very possible that a defence can be mounted on the basis that there is no specific offence here of soliciting or purchasing a service.  What is the Minister's intention in that regard?Deputy Naughten raised the example of the Sligo case where a young woman ended up in Mountjoy in any event.  It seems horrific that in a civilised jurisdiction somebody found to be enslaved in this trade can end up in Mountjoy or can be subject to deportation.  Surely such circumstances ought to be provided for.  The Bill, as it stands, does nothing to address the fact that those who are trafficked can still be jailed or deported.  That ought to be provided for in the Bill.  There is an excuse for victims of trafficking to be exempt from criminal liability in circumstances where the perceived offence, regardless of its nature, is derived from their original condition of having been enslaved in this industry.  Otherwise, the notion that the State goes to the rescue of a young woman who finds herself in these circumstances, so that she ends up in Mountjoy, seems to defeat the purpose of what we are seeking to do here.A number of recommendations are made in the research by the two academics to which I referred.  There are 12 brief recommendations in the document.  I would be interested to hear whether the Minister intends to take any of them on board.  For example, on the issue of whether the problem exists in Ireland and, if it does, what is the scale of it and how many young women are  imported here from abroad, imprisoned in Ireland or enslaved to the sex industry, this report recommends that research be funded to provide a comprehensive mapping and analysis of the Irish sex industry to include issues of the relationship between policing, sentencing, policy and user groups to fill a gap in knowledge about the context within which sex trafficking occurs.  The authors recommend that comparative research should be undertaken to explore which models of service provision constitute best practice and which legislative approaches towards prostitution are most effective in combating sex trafficking throughout Europe.They further recommend that the State should provide increased resources to each agency currently providing services to trafficked women to ensure better provision and to secure the rights of trafficked women and that consideration should be given as to whether a service dedicated solely to trafficking victims is required in the Irish context.  It seems that we require more research.  The State ought to be as helpful as it can to agencies struggling to cope with this issue.We can only imagine the degradation inflicted on young girls who find themselves, through no fault of their own, in the circumstances described in some of the research I have read.It is regrettable that we are coming to deal with this issue so late in the day, but better late than never.  Now that we are dealing with it, we ought to deal with it in the holistic way recommended by the experts, to which the Minister seems to pay lip service in his speech.  If he is to give effect to that approach, some of the issues he said are for another day when we deal with the immigration and residence Bill is not the correct way to deal with this issue.  This is a Bill about trafficking and we should deal with that issue in a holistic fashion and take on board the advice of some of the people who work with this problem and who have brought it to the level that it is a political issue that can no longer be ignored in this House.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I am delighted to speak on the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill, which deals with a despicable crime and what is widely agreed to constitute a modern form of slavery.  This Bill is timely given that it is 200 years since the abolition of the slave trade.Contrary to public perception there is existing legislation to prosecute people for trafficking offences.  Under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 it is an offence, punishable by up to life imprisonment, to traffic a child into, through or out of Ireland for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  For the purposes of this Act, a child is a person under 17 years of age.It is an offence under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 for a person to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into Ireland of another person whom that person knows or has reasonable cause to believe is an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum.  The maximum prison sentence on conviction for this offence is ten years.  In trafficking cases, it is also possible for the prosecuting authorities here to bring charges for a range of offences covered by our criminal law, including sexual offences, false imprisonment, possession of false documents etc.However this legislation will make trafficking a specific offence.  It will provide vulnerable and marginalised victims with greater protection.  Under the new law the powers to prosecute for child trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation will be greatly expanded and the Garda Síochána will have the power to prosecute child trafficking for the purposes of labour exploitation and organ removal.  The sale or purchase of humans of any age, regardless of type of exploitation, is covered and victims of trafficking will be guaranteed anonymity during court proceedings.The new legislation also changes the maximum jail sentence for human trafficking offences from 14 years to life imprisonment.  The immigration, residence and protection Bill, to be introduced later, is aimed at helping the victims.  This will set up a system whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also, in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter, a further period of residence to enable him or her to do so.The Government must expressly legislate for protective measures for victims.  Otherwise victims will not come forward to the authorities.  This is vital not only for the health and safety of the victims but also to ensure that we are aware of the scale and the nature of this problem.  I welcome measures in the Bill that will ensure the right to anonymity for those who testify in court against the trafficker and exclude members of the public from proceedings where publicity might place trafficking victims or their families at risk.  Furthermore, I am happy to see that this tough new legislation is being accompanied by a commensurate jail sentence of life imprisonment.The Bill is just one part of the strategy which involves the establishment of a high level group to combat trafficking.  This Bill will also enable the State to comply with the relevant victim protection provisions in the Council of Europe convention.  A high level working group dedicated to putting in place an action plan covering all aspects of this horrendous crime will also be established.Over a year ago I saw a "Prime Time Investigates" programme on the issue which shocked me and no doubt had a similar effect on everyone who saw it.  It showed women who had voluntarily left their home to set out to countries like Ireland, only to find when they arrive at their destination they were expected to work as a prostitute.  The pimps running the trafficking trade are brutal and the women experience extreme violence.  They are raped, beaten and even starved in order to force them to work.  Often the pimps will also threaten to kill their families if the women refuse to co-operate.Of course there has always been prostitution.  However in the past this usually took the form of street prostitution, with most women operating for themselves and no involvement of serious criminal gangs.  While brothels were in existence their prevalence was much less than today.  Encounters with non-national women were extremely rare.  This legislation is very timely as the industry has become highly organized and is firmly linked with a global crime network.In recent times the tolerance of the sexual exploitation of women for entertainment has grown while the stigma for the women involved remains the same.  Ruhama appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights in May 2006 and stated that it knew of 200 women who had been trafficked into Ireland in recent years. It believes this represents the tip of the iceberg, to which Deputy Rabbitte and other Members referred.  The unpalatable truth is that these women are trafficked because there is an organised sex industry to receive them and because the demand for commercial sexual services in women and children is so lucrative.I commend the work of Ms Mary Crilly and the Cork Rape Crisis Centre for raising awareness in Cork of sexual exploitation and trafficking.  I addressed these groups on this issue some months ago.  The brutal reality seems to be that society holds an ambivalent attitude towards prostitution, an attitude that accepts the idea of trading in human beings in this way and does not see it as exploitation.International experience suggests that countries that have legalised prostitution create an environment that is more conducive to trafficking.  It creates a safe haven for criminals who can now operate with impunity under the cover of legitimacy.  In the state of Victoria in Australia it was found that, contrary to expectations, legalisation resulted in a great increase in unlicensed brothels.I researched the situation at home and abroad before speaking in the House.  What I learned left me both astonished and truly horrified.  I am sure Members are aware of the following facts but I wish to spend a few minutes detailing what I have learnt.  The United Nations estimates that between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are trafficked around the world for purposes of forced prostitution, labour and other forms of exploitation every year.  Trafficking is estimated to be a $7 billion dollar annual business.  Some 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the United States from no less than 49 countries every year.  As many as 750,000 women and children have been trafficked into the United States over the past decade.  Women and children as young as 14 have been trafficked from Mexico to Florida and forced to have sex with as many as 130 clients per week in a trailer park.  These women were kept hostage through threats and physical abuse, and were beaten and forced to have abortions.  One woman was locked in a closet for 15 days after trying to escape.Victims of trafficking are subject to gross human rights violations including rape, torture, forced abortions, starvation, and threats of torturing or murdering family members.  Nearly every country is involved in the web of trafficking activities, either as a country of origin, destination or transit.  Countries of destination include Ireland, Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, France, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and the United States.  In the Netherlands, where prostitution has been decriminalised, it is believed that around 3,500 women are trafficked into the country each year from Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia to work in secret brothels or sex clubs, often in shocking conditions.Traffickers recruit women and children through deceptive means including falsified employment advertisements for domestic workers, waitresses and other low-skilled work.  Traffickers include those involved in highly sophisticated networks of organized crime and may be as close to home as a relative to the victim.Traffickers are members of highly sophisticated networks of organized crime.  Traffickers are family members and friends of the trafficking victim and these victims may be used later to traffic other women and children.  Victims of trafficking are afraid to testify or contact law enforcement agencies due to their complicity with traffickers and pimps.By its very nature, human trafficking is a clandestine activity and owing to the intimidation associated with it, victims are often reluctant to come forward to the authorities.  This is the experience internationally and for these reasons, it is impossible to be precise about the extent of human trafficking into Ireland.  We know it is happening but these people exist in the shadows of Irish society.  While I recognise this modern form of slavery is a problem, I was somewhat heartened to read in the recently published United Nations report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, that Ireland ranks at the low end of destination or transit countries in western Europe.  This analysis is confirmed by the US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report 2006, which was published last June and examines the approach to human trafficking in 158 countries.  The report states that "while Ireland has a growing population of migrants, there is not yet evidence of a large number of trafficking victims".  While this remains the case, we have a duty to protect anyone who has been brought into our country in such appalling conditions.To date, Garda operations have uncovered a small number of trafficking cases.  These indicate the involvement of eastern European nationals in trafficking and attempted trafficking activity.  The Garda Síochána and the Garda National Immigration Bureau, in particular, take a proactive and vigorous approach in preventing and combating trafficking of human beings.The Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and police forces across Britain are taking part in the project which aims to help victims of trafficking and prosecute those responsible.  The campaign is named Pentameter II after an operation last year which led to the arrest of more than 200 people and the rescue of 80 women and children forced into sex slavery in the UK.  A permanent unit, the UK human trafficking centre, was set up following the first Pentameter operation, bringing together police, prosecutors and officers.  As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Lenihan commented, operation Pentameter II is an example of the proactive, preventative approach being taken by the Garda Síochána in tackling those who engage in this despicable crime.  To this end, training is key.  A training programme has been prepared for delivery to key Garda personnel throughout the State.  This training programme has been designed specifically to enable members of the Garda Síochána identify victims of trafficking whom they encounter in the course of their duties, ensure that members fully understand the complexity of the phenomenon and ensure that victims receive appropriate assistance from all the relevant agencies.Trafficking like other international crimes requires an international response.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced that Ireland has been invited to be part of a European G6 initiative against human trafficking.  This initiative involves six European countries, namely the UK, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland and will run for one year.  It has four strands of activity.  Ireland will lead the strand on awareness raising and will host an international meeting in Dublin in January 2008.  This initiative is designed to ensure the EU becomes a more hostile environment for criminals engaged in trafficking.  Successful prosecutions, as with other criminal matters, will continue to depend on evidence that will stand up in court and for that to happen, there must be a willingness to co-operate with Garda investigations.  Under this initiative, Ireland will launch new awareness raising campaigns in 2008.  I congratulate the Minister on his involvement.This country has also, through Irish Aid, contributed over €1.7 million towards anti-trafficking projects carried out by the International Labour Organisation among others.  It is also important to ensure that victims receive the support and assistance they need so that they feel safe enough to testify against the perpetrators and are not forced to return to the terrifying situation from which they have just escaped.A group of MPs in the UK recently formed a committee on the issue.  I fully agree with sentiments expressed by the chairman, Mr. Andrew Dismore, MP, who said "We should recognise women trafficked for prostitution through deception, fear and violence as victims of this serious crime and not immigration offenders or criminals themselves."Sex trafficking has become the third most profitable illegal trade in the world, after arms and drugs.  That is a startling revelation, particularly when one thinks of the numbers of people involved.  Somewhere between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are being trafficked throughout the world every year, as estimated by the United Nations.  The truth is that Irish men are paying money for sex with foreign women who live in terror of beatings and other punishments.  Trafficking and prostitution are expressions of a gross form of prejudice against women.  They blight the lives of the weakest women in society — the young, the poor, the sexually abused, those dependent on alcohol or drugs, foreign women and women who are coerced.  I hope this legislation will put an end to such human rights abuses on our shores.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I welcome the publication of this badly-needed legislation.  It is hard to believe that Ireland is the only country in the European Union which has not yet legislated for human trafficking but this Bill represents a move in the right direction.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to create offences criminalising trafficking in persons for the specific purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs.Human trafficking is a modern day form of slavery, as other speakers have argued and is the third largest source of income for organised crime, after trafficking in drugs and arms.  Given the secret nature of the crime, the amount of trafficking known about may only be a fraction of the real amount taking place.  Some 100,000 people are trafficked into Europe every year and forced to work as prostitutes, which is a serious and deplorable situation.  If people see a young girl or boy hanging around a hotel lobby and their intuition tells them something is wrong, they should report it immediately to the local police station.  I would be grateful if the Minister will clarify whether those reporting suspected human trafficking can be assured of confidentiality.  Will they be able to report incidents by dialling a dedicated telephone number rather than a Garda number or by logging onto a specific website?Ruhama is an Irish non-profit organisation involved in the provision of outreach services to women engaged in prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation.  It operates in a spirit of empathy, respect and compassion.  Ruhama also offers development services for women including computer training, employment training support, personal support and counselling.  Awareness training and advocacy is a growing component of its work.  Ruhama reported that up to the year 2006 it was aware of 200 women who had been trafficked into Ireland for the purposes of prostitution, 132 of whom were assisted by the organisation.  Of that group, 73% were originally from eastern Europe, 21% from Africa, 4% from south America and 2% from Asia.  There were 23 new cases of assistance to trafficked women in 2005 and 18 in 2006.    It would be remiss of me not to state my appreciation of those volunteers who do such great work for Ruhama.  Will the Minister look on that organisation favourably regarding funding for its future needs?Kathleen Fahy, a director of Ruhama, said in a recent press release that Ireland must face up to the reality that women are being trafficked into the country for the purposes of prostitution and that effective legislation must be put in place to deal with this horrific crime.  She also said that trafficking is well organised, subtle and brutal and requires a national vice squad to deal with the issues effectively.  Are there plans to establish such a squad?The problem of trafficking is not confined to Dublin.  In 2005, 25% of trafficked women who were assisted by Ruhama were located outside Dublin.  By 2006, this had increased to 40%.  All of 16 women assisted to date this year have been referred to Ruhama from outside Dublin.  Neither the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 nor the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 have resulted in a single prosecution for the crime of trafficking, even though individuals have been arrested and charged.  This is in contrast to other countries where there have been up to 7,000 prosecutions in 20 countries with 3,000 convictions.  Unfortunately, Ireland does not have strong legislation in place to allow for successful convictions.  Hopefully, the publication of this Bill will address all the issues involved.In 2004, Italy led Europe in recognising the need to protect victims of trafficking.  Some 1,940 victims, including 118 children, received assistance under social programmes.  In Ireland, the system for protecting victims is ad hoc, sometimes it is offered by non-governmental organisations such as Ruhama.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau also assists on a case-by-case basis.  There is, however, no co-ordinated multi-agency response to assist victims of trafficking.Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the UN trafficking protocol which was opened for signature in 2000.  It urges states to protect and assist victims of trafficking with full respect for their human rights.  Ireland has not ratified the UN optional protocol for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The Irish Refugee Council believes Ireland should sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  While Ireland has not even signed this convention, ratifying it would place an obligation on the State to address the issues relating to trafficking.As recognised in this convention, trafficking is a violation of human rights and an offence against human dignity and integrity.  The convention requires those states that become parties to take measures individually and collectively to prevent trafficking, to prosecute those responsible for trafficking and to take specific measures to protect and respect the rights of trafficked persons.It is estimated that between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are moved across international borders each year.  The profits to be made are similar to those in the illegal drugs and arms trade.  The International Organization for Migration estimates that trafficking in humans is worth $8 billion annually.Ireland is not immune to international trends and should be proactive in addressing this relatively new phenomenon.  Some recent examples as reported in the media are disturbing.  In May 2004, The Irish Times reported the case of an 18 year old eastern European woman who had come to the attention of gardaí when they were called to a house in Dublin.  She was admitted to hospital as she had been beaten by a man who had held her at the house.  He had forced her to have sex with 200 men and it subsequently emerged she was six months pregnant by him.  She informed the Garda she had been taken by bus to Spain to be given a false Italian passport and trafficked to Ireland.In September 2005, The Irish Times reported the case of a 16 year old east African woman who came to the attention of gardaí in County Louth after she was held captive in a house and abused.  She had been taken from her home village in Africa at 12 years of age and inducted into sex slavery in different countries before being trafficked into Ireland.  The girl recollected being trafficked through at least two airports.  In April 2006, The Sligo Champion carried a report of a 17 year old west African girl who came to the attention of gardaí while working as a prostitute in the Sligo area.  It subsequently came to light she was a minor and had been trafficked to a country specifically for the intention of being exploited by an organised prostitution ring.In September 2006, the Irish Examiner carried a report about a north African minor who had been rescued from a brothel by gardaí and was put into the care of the HSE.  Without adequate supervisory staffing, she unfortunately went missing from the centre in days.One of the Irish Refugee Council's recommendations is that Ireland should sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings and the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons.  The council also recommends that Ireland should ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  The upcoming immigration, residence and protection Bill must include the provision for the immediate granting of visas to victims of trafficking on humanitarian grounds.  Legislation which is being drafted to prosecute traffickers must be enacted as soon as possible.Victims of trafficking should be advised of the asylum process and the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner should adhere to recent UNHCR guidelines when determining the status of a victim of trafficking as gender persecution.  Immigration and refugee status should not be based on the victim assisting investigations by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must fund assistance programmes and safe accommodation centres for victims of trafficking.  Ireland must take measures to address the disappearance of trafficked and exploited children from accommodation centres.  A social worker must be based at points of entry to identify vulnerable children entering the country.The offences set out in sections 3 to 5, inclusive, will be punishable by a maximum prison sentence of life, which is to be commended.  Sections 10 and 11 provide a power to exclude persons from the courts during proceedings in trafficking cases and to guarantee anonymity.  An amendment to section 12 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 provides that an alleged trafficking victim will be able to give evidence via a live television link either from Ireland or abroad.Poverty and lack of economic opportunity make women and children potential victims of traffickers associated with international criminal organisations.  They are vulnerable people who are given false promises of job opportunities in other countries.  Many of those who accept such offers from what appear to be bona fide sources find themselves in situations where their documents are destroyed, both they and their families are threatened with harm and if they are bonded in debt they have no chance of repaying.  While women and children are particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking, human trafficking is not limited to sexual exploitation.  It also includes persons who are trafficked into forced marriages or into bonded labour markets such as sweatshops, agricultural plantations or domestic service.The prevention of human trafficking requires several types of intervention.  Some are of low to moderate cost and have immediate impact, such as awareness campaigns that allow high risk individuals to make informed decisions.  Strong laws need to be enforced as an immediate deterrent, however, although serious law enforcement is expensive.  Nonetheless, as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  According to Family Health International, FHI, in 1999 a number of programmes in Asia had begun to address the causes of trafficking in women.  One of Thailand's responses was to focus on the source of demand for trafficked services such as the clients of underage sex workers.  Through the impetus and lobbying of its National Commission on Women's Affairs, NCWA, Thailand was the first country in the region to pass laws that imposed greater penalties on customers rather than sellers involved in commercial sex with underage partners.  Application of the law has been light, but it is the basis for future enforcement.  The NCWA is also trying to change male sexual norms through a national poster campaign, with messages showing a child saying, "My father does not visit prostitutes".In China the State Council, local party commissions and government agencies attach importance to combating human trafficking.  In provinces infested with crime leading functionaries from the police, the office of the procurator, the courts, civil departments, media, schools, women's federations, trade unions and the Communist Youth League each play a role in combating trafficking.  Women's organisations help government agencies by creating awareness among illiterate women who are most vulnerable as regards trafficking.  Seminars and training courses are sponsored by those organisations to raise awareness as regards laws and policies against trafficking.  Printed materials such as the anti-trafficking manual prepared by the All-China Women's Federation and the Ministry of Justice are also distributed to women.Awareness campaigns are used to advise citizens in America of the threat of human trafficking.  Perhaps the Minister might consider such initiatives for Ireland.  The "Be Smart, Be Safe" brochures describe the tactics criminal gangs use to coerce and traffic women, the risks of trafficking, what women can do to protect themselves against illegitimate groups, victims' rights and how women can get help in the United States.  Through its global television campaign on human trafficking, the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention warns millions of potential victims about the dangers of trafficking.I agree with Amnesty International, which welcomed the publication of this Bill, but expressed concerns about the lack of measures to support and protect the victims of trafficking.  I welcome, too, the fact the Minister is recognising victims of human trafficking for the first time and offering them anonymity in court, which is certainly unprecedented in Ireland.  The Bill, however, must deal with the fact that those who are trafficked can still be jailed or deported.  Last week an NUI Galway report highlighted the case of a trafficked woman being picked up by gardaí and sent to Mountjoy jail.  That is completely wrong and the Minister should not be criminalising victims.  I read in the media recently about a joint policing initiative between Ireland and Britain to combat human trafficking.  It will involve co-operation and the sharing of information and intelligence as well as shared initiatives for the training of officers.  This is obviously in response to growing evidence that people are being trafficked into the UK via Irish ports such as Rosslare.  Recently, a Welsh Assembly report on trafficking referred to Ireland being used as an access route into Wales.  This is very disturbing.  That accusation follows a BBC interview with a Bulgarian criminal who openly admitted that gangs frequently use Ireland as the easy access route into Britain to avoid security checks in British ports.  We need to close that loophole and not be seen by international traffickers as an easy target.In conclusion I very much welcome the Bill and look forward to the imminent prosecution of those involved in trafficking people into our country.  They are not being sufficiently prosecuted at present and while the legislation is going in the right direction, much more will have to be done as well, particularly as regards awareness campaigns, a Garda vice squad etc.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I welcome the publication of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007.  One should always declare one's interests and I am one of eight patrons of Ruhama, the only body dealing with prostitution in Ireland in a helpful, sympathetic and open manner.  I have been a patron for 15 or 16 years and I pay tribute to the work former Deputy Monica Barnes of Fine Gael did in this area.  I was Minister for Health for ten short weeks when she phoned to say she wanted to meet me.  Incidentally, I was not put out for any misdemeanour, but rather because I did not support the incoming Taoiseach and then leader of Fianna Fáil.  I did, later, of course.  In any event she came to see me in Hawkins House and brought three women with her who had set up Ruhama.  It was the spring of 1992 and since then I have kept in touch with them and have been able to be of some help, periodically.At that time they wanted a grant towards the cost of a van for use in their street work.  The Department of Health had a small amount of National Lottery funding and because of my great admiration for Monica Barnes and what she did for women, as well as for the work of Ruhama, we gave them £20,000 to enable them to go onto the streets, so to speak, for the first time and meet with the women who were under the control of pimps, recruiters etc.  I was always glad to have been of help in that regard.I asked at one stage what Ruhama meant.  It is from Lo-Ruhama in the Book of Hosea in the Old Testament, meaning, "She who is not loved, is now loved".  I thought that was so evocative and indicative of what Ruhama does.  In my previous existence in the Seanad, I introduced a Private Members' Bill on this whole issue.  It never got anywhere as it was overtaken by the election and we all became very busy.  Nonetheless, I did that and carried out a good deal of research in the process.This Bill is a very good initiative.  I know the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, had done a certain amount of work in this area and indeed had almost brought the Bill to fruition.  It is both evolutionary and developmental in its nature.  It is evolutionary because legislation has already been passed in this area, including the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 and the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998.  When introducing this Bill, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated he would introduce another that would provide further certainty and safeguards for women.  He said "it is intended that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State," and that he would achieve this in the forthcoming immigration and residency Bill.  I am glad because such a provision is not included in the legislation as drafted.  Frameworks always sound good but I wonder what legal certainty the proposed framework will have when implemented.  A framework would offer succour and allow those who have been trafficked a period of reflection and recovery.  It would be a very powerful statement of our real intent to deal with the roller-coaster emotions of women trafficked into Ireland.I support many other aspects of this Bill, including the provision on consent.  The issue of consent leads to uncertainty because it is hard to prove.  To my mind, any of the women helped by Ruhama certainly did not give consent to their recruiters and were lured under the pretext that faraway hills were green and that they would have a rosy life and great earning potential in Ireland.  Little do those being lured know they are being introduced to seedy, grubby apartments or bedsits in which they are told to ply their trade and give their money to their pimp or recruiter.  They are debased and abused on an hourly basis and if their earnings are not high enough, they are further dehumanised and debased.  Consent is, therefore, a difficult issue.  I believe no consent is given.The problem of trafficking is very significant and opaque and largely unreported, except for incidents such as the Sligo and Galway cases, as mentioned by colleagues in the House.  When the Minister stated there were 76 cases, he was not reflecting the true number.  Who reports such incidents?  If a woman manages to escape, is she then free from the fear of being caught again by her recruiter who would make her undergo further awful debasement?  While I accept that the figure of 76 cases in seven years was given to the Minister by his officials in good faith, I do not believe it reflects the true number.  The fear felt by a woman when approaching a garda is significant.  I, therefore, caution against believing trafficking is very rare.  Although 76 cases are 76 too many, I believe there are even more.  The problem is opaque and I do not know how it can be made less so.Article 26 of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings proposed a non-punishment provision but it has not been included in this legislation.  I hope it will be entertained by the Minister on Committee Stage.  We have cited the case of the woman incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison simply because she was trafficked into the country.  She was under the cloud of having committed a crime but we should be very clear that she committed none.  The crime was on the part of the person who procured her for the purpose of prostitution.The old ideas on prostitution have long gone.  Prostitution was never right but it used to involve a woman on the street being approached by a man in a car.  Ruhama's biennial report for 2005-06 states:It is now more controlled by criminals with an increasing number of women in indoor prostitution, operating out of brothels, massage parlours, escort agencies etc.  These are dispersed throughout the city and indeed throughout the entire country.  They are able to operate clandestinely out of private apartments.  Modern technology (mobile phones and the internet) has hugely assisted pimps in advertising their prostitution scams without restrictions and enabling easy covert access for the men who buy the women.We may not be open about the subject but it is a question of men paying money to get women and of the debasement of women.  It is still the case that it is a domestic issue, but one must bear in mind the circumstances of women brought from abroad in the belief they are coming to a bright new life in a new land where they will have a job with promises of monetary return.  In the first week or two after their arrival they may be brought around the streets of the capital or elsewhere in the belief they are in a bright new land, but they are then harnessed into working in prostitution, on foot of which the trafficker or pimp earns considerable cash returns.  One can only imagine the disillusionment of the women and their feelings of debasement and humiliation.  Many would not have known anything about this small land to which they were lured and may only have seen it on a map or globe.  If they are from a country in eastern Europe where Roman Catholicism is practised, they may have been told they were being brought to a Catholic country.The Ireland of which we speak and to which women are being trafficked is no longer the land of comely maidens and youthful swains who are seeking to meet, talk and walk with one another.  Rather, it is a land of sleazy brothels where seedy acts are carried out for money.  The women acting as the conduit for the money are receiving very small recompense and are victims of international groups which are, in many cases, very powerful and are seeking to establish centres in various countries in which they can ply their trade and abuse women.I commend the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his officials on introducing the Bill so soon after the formation of the new Government.  I am happy they have done so.  I am pleased that many of the suggestions I made in my Private Members' Bill are included in this legislation.  However, I am worried that the Bill does nothing to change the law whereby those who are trafficked can be jailed or deported.  What are we talking about?  It is the most awful thing.  Perhaps we are harking back to the days of cherchez la femme, when it was assumed that women were at fault.  It is proposed that women can be jailed or deported for the crime of having been trafficked.  When the Minister and his officials review the comments made by Deputies today, I hope they consider drawing up some amendments to address this aspect of the Bill.I appreciate that the matter of consent is a difficult one.  Article 4b of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings — the trafficking protocol — dictates that a victim of trafficking cannot legally be said to have consented when any of the means set out in the definition of trafficking in Article 4a have been used.  Ruhama has said that the Moldovan trafficking legislation sets an example in this regard.  The action being taken in this Chamber today means that it is a good day for the human rights of women, in particular.  It is good that Ireland will have finally acceded to the Council of Europe protocol when this legislation has been enacted.  I hope Ruhama will be represented on the high level group that is to be established.I praise the vice squad of the Garda Síochána, which does a great deal of work with Ruhama in tackling trafficking, which is a major global problem, in as diligent a manner as it tackled earlier problems associated with prostitution.  I am always conscious of the good and bad that exists in the world.  It cannot be doubted that evil will always abound.  No law, however worthy and well-implemented, will ever root out evil practices like trafficking.  As legislators, we are responsible for ensuring that those who engage in the trafficking of other human beings can be caught.  Our duty is to ensure that no aspect of human trafficking is allowed to continue, so that it becomes one of the forms of evil we leave behind in the early days of this new century.

I share the sentiments of the Deputies who have said the legislation is welcome.  Fine Gael will support the Bill on Second Stage because it is necessary if Ireland is to take action against human trafficking.  The process of introducing this legislation has been quite protracted.  However, the Bill does not go far enough in protecting and supporting the victims it should be helping.  When examining and debating this issue, it is important that we consistently remind ourselves that the offence of human trafficking is committed against those who are trafficked, rather than by such people.  They should not be seen as criminals in any way.  The actions we take should be aimed at helping victims, just as they are in the case of any other criminal offence.The trafficking of women and children is a rapidly growing worldwide phenomenon, sadly.  It can be compared to the slavery industry of many years ago, which we are very quick to criticise nowadays.  We are not as quick to recognise the form of the problem that is prevalent in today's society.  The victims of human traffickers are vulnerable women who are offered a wonderful new life that is full of joy and promise.  Rather than being helped with everyday matters like work, travel, safety and security, however, they are bought, sold, imprisoned, raped and tortured.  The fear and oppression with which such women have to live causes them to get trapped in a cycle from which they cannot possibly escape.  As previous speakers have acknowledged, human trafficking has become a global business, in effect.  It has been described by Ruhama, the work of which has been rightly acknowledged and welcomed in the House, as the third most lucrative illegal activity, after arms and drugs trading.  It is a multi-billion dollar industry.While I welcome some aspects of the Bill before the House, I am concerned that it considers the issue of human trafficking almost exclusively from the perspective of law enforcement, or the perspective of the crime.  The human rights of the victims of human trafficking are largely ignored in the legislation.  I acknowledge and appreciate the comments of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who has said he will introduce further legislation to deal with some of the matters to which I refer.  However, it would have been more beneficial to deal with these issues in a holistic way in a single Bill.  While I accept that prosecution, which is the focus of this Bill, is necessary, I am more concerned about preventing trafficking and protecting the vulnerable women and children who are being preyed on.In its defence of its inaction in this area to date, the Government has focused on the lack of statistical information about how many people are affected by human trafficking, thereby failing to show a basic understanding of the complexity of the issue.  It could be argued that the Government is responsible for collecting such information.  The shortage of information is a consequence of the lack of legislation and the resultant failure of prosecutions.  Members of this House have to grapple with the real difficulties which are caused by the under-reporting of many crimes against women, such as rape and domestic violence.  As Deputy O'Rourke and others mentioned, under-reporting often results from fear, which itself is often a reflection of the power of the perpetrator and the lack of power of the victim.I understand that the Minister referred earlier to some of the research that has been done in this area.  I would like to highlight the research of Dr. Eilís Ward and Dr. Gillian Wylie, which is summarised in their report, The Nature and Extent of Trafficking Women into Ireland for the Purposes of Sexual Exploitation 2000-2006: a Report from Findings.  Their analysis of trafficking cases between 2000 and 2006 found that the probable minimum number of cases in Ireland was 76, with the vast majority occurring between 2003 and 2006.  The Ruhama women's project reported in 2003 that more and more women are being trafficked into Ireland, mostly from eastern Europe.  The study done by Dr. Ward and Dr. Wylie confirms the prominence of eastern European women in these cases.  It found that most trafficked women come from eastern Europe, with the second largest group coming from Africa.  It reported that Nigerian women comprised the single biggest national grouping.It has already been pointed out in this debate that there are conflicting statistics in this regard.  I am not sure that is the point, however, because women and children who have been trafficked will take little comfort from knowing there are other people in the same situation.  A document published by the US State Department last year, Trafficking in Persons Report June 2007, described Ireland as a country of transit and destination.  The US report outlines some similar statistics to those I have mentioned.  In June of this year, the Irish joint non-governmental group dealing with human trafficking stated that the US report seriously underestimates the extent of the phenomenon as it exists in this country today.  The members of the group are working with the victims of this crime on a daily basis by gaining access to them, supporting them and trying to win their trust.  It is difficult to collate information on human trafficking, which means the information we have is extremely valuable.  The non-governmental group is filling a gap that the Government and this House have failed to fill over recent years.  We have failed to take sufficient action on this issue, although I accept that other legislation is in the pipeline.It is easy for the Irish people to ignore this crime because we tend to think it does not affect us.  As our families and friends are not being trafficked, we cannot see the reality of the crime.  It is easy to adopt an attitude of "out of sight, out of mind" or "ignorance is bliss".  There is a lack of support for those who have been trafficked.  The various interests involved in this area agree that the lack of human trafficking legislation, which the Government is addressing to some extent today, has allowed this problem to remain underground.  The problem is made worse when one considers the lack of funding supports, the lack of policy direction, the State's concentration on the crime aspect of human trafficking and the lack of a co-ordinated and holistic approach.  Some 36 of the 76 women who were clearly identified in the report published by Dr. Ward and Dr. Wylie subsequently disappeared, and their whereabouts and status is now described as "unknown".Reports on child trafficking in this morning's news are even more frightening.  While I accept there is no allegation of trafficking into or out or Ireland being linked to the 19 arrests yesterday, nonetheless, the statistic on children who have gone missing in this country is frightening; a total of 328 children cannot be traced.  If this statistic related to 328 Irish children the public response and the response of the Government and this House would be far stronger and more immediate.  It would be rightly considered a national scandal; either way it is a national scandal.It seems that so long as these children are not our own children or those of our neighbours, this issue can be brushed under the carpet.  What is worse and a greater cause for concern is that a few of these children — I do not have the exact figure — were supposed to be under the protection of the State and of the Health Service Executive when they went missing.  This is an indictment of the system and of the failure to address these problems.  While this Bill will go some way, it will not deal with the issue of such a number of children being missing.  It is not known whether some of these children may have left the country so they are still classified as missing.Ireland has signed up to a number of human rights instruments relating to this issue.  I am disappointed that today's legislation does not incorporate these instruments into law in order to enhance the human rights of those affected.  It is easy to sign up to these instruments but the real test is to put them into practice.Ireland has signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I acknowledge this legislation will go some way towards meeting some of the articles in that convention in terms of exploitation and trafficking.  However, the purpose of Article 39 is to secure both the physical and psychological recovery of victims and to try to reintegrate them but I do not believe this will be achieved by this legislation.The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, expressed concern in 2005 about the trafficking of women and girls in Ireland.  The convention commented on the lack of information on the extent of the problem, the lack of specific legislation in this area and the lack of a comprehensive strategy to combat the problem.  The Government has addressed some of those concerns in this Bill, in particular with regard to prosecution and punishment of offenders.  However, the recommendation that "measures be put in place to provide for the physical, psychological and social recovery of women and girls who have been victims of trafficking, including the provision of shelter, counselling and medical care", has largely been ignored.Another important aspect of the recommendations is that border police and law enforcement officials be provided with the requisite skills to recognise and provide support to victims of trafficking.  This is an important point.The Irish Human Rights Commission is to be commended on its work in this area.  In July 2007 the commission held a conference on this issue.  The conference made clear that the Garda Síochána must be equipped "with clear and practical laws, resources and most importantly receive comprehensive training informed by the experiences of police in other jurisdictions and by groups working with victims of trafficking in Ireland".  This is a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland over the past decade and while specialist gardaí will have the skills to deal with it, many will not.  I appreciate that some of these specialists are involved in Operation Pentameter II but it is vital that gardaí are trained to recognise this problem and to see it from the perspective of not only prosecuting the perpetrator but also assisting the victims.It is acknowledged that trafficking is not the easiest of crimes to identify.  The NGOs and those working in the area cannot be expected to be the only ones helping these terrified victims to come forward.  The Garda Síochána must also play a role in this regard.I quote the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights who recommended that as the very first principle, "The human rights of trafficked persons shall be at the centre of all efforts to prevent and combat trafficking and to protect, assist and provide redress to victims".  I have already stressed the need for a victim-centred approach, but the matter deserves further detail.  We only help a person to a limited extent without the full holistic range of measures.  The word of one victim who has had a bad experience in our criminal justice system will stop many others from coming forward.I welcome the Minister's measures in terms of anonymity and the taking of evidence by means of electronic link.  These are important measures which will help to address some, but not all, of the safety issues which concern victims.  However, while victims fear the perpetrator, they also fear the State, or any state into which they have been trafficked.  The risk of coming forward includes not only fear of reprisal from the perpetrator but fear of removal from the State. I am not going to pretend this is an easy issue to tackle and I appreciate the Minister's legitimate concerns about the exploitation of loopholes.  However, I ask the Minister to consider the concerns about the exploitation of women and children.  In her paper to the Irish Human Rights Commission conference, commissioner Suzanne Egan addressed some of these difficulties and outlined some obligations under the convention.  These include obligations to provide appropriate and secure accommodation, psychological and material assistance, access to emergency medical treatment, translation and interpretative services, counselling and information, and access to education for their children.  States must take measures to ensure that assistance to a victim is not made conditional on his or her willingness to act as a witness.  Ireland has yet to formally ratify this convention but the argument is well made that Ireland nonetheless has obligations under other international instruments which it has adopted.The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, will be aware of the Australian automatic humanitarian visa system, which came about due to the tragic death of a young woman in a detention centre in 2003.  Those victims of trafficking in Ireland are subject to deportation, despite the fact that the UNHCR has launched guidelines that trafficking amounts to persecution.  Only this month a report highlighted the case of a trafficked woman being picked up by gardaí and sent to Mountjoy Prison.  Where is the humanity in that?  Temporary residence is not too much to grant people who have already suffered so much.  It must be borne in mind that the offence is being committed against the trafficked person.It is important to consider the connection between prostitution and human trafficking and what is, effectively, organised crime.  The growth of a highly profitable sex industry which has been legalised in many countries other than Ireland, has led to women and children becoming a commodity.  It is argued that trafficking for sexual purposes will never be eliminated unless the international community also takes a vigorous stand against prostitution and sexual exploitation.  In a 2005 report, Poulin referred to the Netherlands as an example of the link between the growth of the sex industry and the growth of trafficking for the purpose of prostitution and the statistics are outlined.  There are some contradictions in Irish law where the focus has been on controlling, containing and concealing the sale of sex.  We criminalise the public offer of sex for sale but not the private offer by a single woman.  We penalise those working as prostitutes but not their customers.The Swedish model should be considered.  The Swedish Government made a decision in 1999 that those creating the demand, such as the traffickers, pimps and customers, should bear the brunt of responsibility for this industry.  In implementing these reforms the Government was aware that the political, social and economic conditions under which women and children live must be transformed by developments in the area of poverty reduction and social programmes aimed exclusively at women.  The Swedish legislation prohibits the purchase of sexual services.  A person who obtains casual sexual relations in exchange for payment shall be guilty of an offence and the attempted purchase of sexual services is also punishable.  The offence comprises all forms of sexual services, whether purchased on the street, in brothels, in massage parlours, from escort services or other similar circumstances.  A person who promotes or encourages or improperly exploits, for commercial purposes, casual sexual relations entered into by another person in exchange for payment, is guilty of an offence.  If the offence is aggravated the punishment is increased.  The promotion may take various forms, such as operating a brothel, letting premises for the purposes of prostitution or helping a buyer find prostituted persons.The Swedish Government has reported that since the Act came into force, there has been a dramatic drop in the number of women in street prostitution.  Along with the recruitment of women into prostitution, criminalisation of the buyer has also seen a drop in the number of men who buy sexual services.  Since the introduction of the new regime in 1999, the number of women involved in street prostitution in Sweden has decreased by at least 30% down to 50% and the recruitment of new women has almost stopped.  This begs the question whether this legislation has driven the industry underground.  There is no evidence that the sale of women has moved from the streets to the Internet.  It is reported that the number of Swedish women who are prostituted by means of the Internet remains stable.Strangely, this matter falls under the remit of the Ministry with responsibility for industry which also reports that public support for legislation is growing.  As the primary purpose of the law is to prevent the purchase of sexual services, often the police intervene before the offence is committed.  Statistics which relate to the arrest and prosecution of perpetrators are not always good indicators of how well the new laws work.  Swedish women's movements and groups that work with prostituted women have reported that the new laws have acted as an incentive to prostituted women to leave prostitution.  The laws further act as a deterrent to young women who have not yet entered prostitution but are runaways or soft drug abusers.I welcome the legislation but it has missed many points.  I urge the Government to begin immediately a process of bringing into law those conventions to which the State signed up.  This will ensure women and children are adequately protected.  I also urge the Government to provide far greater supports and funding for groups dealing with this issue because they are the best people to help.  I look forward to the next Bill the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will introduce in this area but it would have been better to have had one Bill covering the entire issue.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007, which is important because it deals with the rights of human beings and is intended to protect the weak, exploited, innocent and vulnerable.  It is a clear response to the blatant human rights abuses which exist in Ireland and internationally.  I will establish my position as an independent Member of the Oireachtas on the issue and on what we as legislators can do to assist exploited people.Human trafficking, or 21st century slavery, is one of the most lucrative, globalised criminal activities of our time.  There is evidence that it has grown in Ireland and one reason for this is the lack of legislation.  This Bill has been introduced to combat this and I warmly welcome it.  It is a sensible way forward.I support initiatives to introduce these measures in the Dáil.  The UN protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Council of Europe's convention on action against trafficking in human beings must be ratified by the Government.  We need to enact laws aimed at preventing this human rights abuse, penalising those who engage in it and protecting and rehabilitating those trafficked.  I do not want any fudge on this matter.  Governments throughout the European Union and the United Nations must be proactive on this issue.  Sitting on the fence or throwing our hands in the air is not and can never be an option.As I am discussing human rights, I cannot stay silent on how George Bush treated the Cuban people in his recent statements.  Mr. Bush is an international bully and he has the brass neck to announce new measures and actions to reinforce the US blockade against Cuba.  The plan is an attack on the Cuban people and an attempt to starve them into submission.  This is relevant to human rights.  I challenge Bush, his gang of neocons and all those who made the world a more dangerous place.  They are a disgrace to mankind and a menace to those who believe in open, political dialogue.I remind the Irish people of the 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands of US-based terrorist groups.  This is the reality for the Cuban people and I stand by them in the Parliament today.  I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be more proactive on this issue and to stand up to George Bush at EU and international level.  We cannot have a world leader trampling on the rights of the Cuban people and reinforcing and worsening the blockade.During the coming weeks, Mr. Philip Agee, a former member of the CIA will visit Ireland.  I urge all those who believe this is a one-sided issue to listen to him.  He was granted asylum in Cuba and has written extensively on the role of the CIA in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s.  He is a world authority on the operations undertaken and the methods used at that time.  He will be in Ireland to promote a new film about the CIA and the undeclared terrorist US war against Cuba, a war which——

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I appreciate that but I wish to raise this issue.  As we are discussing human rights and the abuse of people it is important that we put this on the record and stand up and state that the Irish people will not accept it.  I urge people to listen to Mr. Agee when he visits Ireland.  I call on the American people to reject Bush and support progressive views on Cuba.  This debate is on criminal law and what George Bush is up to is criminal.The primary purpose of the Bill is to create offences criminalising trafficking in persons for the specific purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation or the removal of their organs and to provide severe penalties for anyone found guilty of committing the offences.  The offences are in line with international norms as established in the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings, the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations convention against international organised crime and the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings.  It also criminalises the selling or purchasing of human beings, children and adults, for any purpose.  The sale of children for the purpose of exploitation is a requirement of the optional protocol to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.Consider the phrases used in the Bill such as "the sexual exploitation of children", "organs" and "child prostitution".  It is a sad reality of the modern world that we are having this debate.  Despite all the talk and rhetoric about human rights, throughout the world there are still children who are abused and who have their human rights exploited.  I worked with children for more than 20 years and it is important that we identify and support them, particularly those who were abused.  That is a nightmare for the families involved.Regularly we hear in the media of children who have gone missing here and in other European countries.  Imagine what it is like for a five or six year old girl or a seven or eight year old boy in that situation.  Many people state that a child in such a situation might be better off dead.  This is the sad reality and it is what this debate is about.  That is why I warmly welcome the progressive legislation before the House.  I will call on all Members to support the legislation.  This is the time to stand up and be counted and do something about it.A key aspect will be the implementation of the legislation.  I will discuss the area of policing later.  Recent events with regard to child abusers and people involved in pornography and Garda involvement with Interpol in Thailand showed the positive side of good quality policing.  As well as good policing not only do we need legislation but also sound prevention policies.  During the last Dáil we passed many Bills to deal with organised crime.  However, we still have a horrific situation.  It is not only about legislation but about tackling, assisting and prevention.Many people do not take the word "prevention" seriously, particularly when it comes to crime and more particularly the exploitation of children.  If children in families at risk and dysfunctional families and disadvantaged children are supported at an early age many of them can be saved.  We have many examples of good practice, particularly in disadvantaged schools, by teachers, principals and home-school-liaison teachers.  People do not realise the major positive impact they have on communities and the amount of dysfunctionality and exploitation which they prevent.  That is all connected to this debate and we must be proactive at international, EU and UN level in dealing with the situation.Section 2 provides the definitions for the Bill.  The definition of "labour exploitation" applies to both children and adults who have been trafficked for that purpose.  The definition of "sexual exploitation" applies to the trafficking of adults for the purpose of sexual exploitation — the provision criminalising the trafficking of children for the purpose of sexual exploitation is being inserted into the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 in substitution for the existing child trafficking provisions in that Act.  This section is a very influential and important part of the Bill.  The issue is that we have got to criminalise the people directly involved.  We also have a responsibility to stand up and be counted.Section 7(3) creates an offence of conspiring with or inciting a person in the State to traffic or sell or purchase a human being in another country and subsection (4) makes it an offence for an Irish citizen or person ordinarily resident in the State to conspire with or incite another person outside the State to traffick or sell or purchase a human being.  Under subsection (5) it is an offence for people to conspire with or incite in the State or another country another person to traffick or sell or purchase an Irish citizen outside the State and subsection (6) makes it an offence to conspire with or incite, in another country, an Irish citizen or person ordinarily resident in the State to do an act in another country that if done in the State would constitute the offence of trafficking or selling or purchasing human beings.  The maximum penalty for committing or attempting to commit any of the above offences is an unlimited fine and-or life imprisonment.  The phrase "purchase of a human being" is horrific.  It is a nightmare for young people, particularly very young boys and girls.  We cannot have a situation where human beings can be purchased and treated in such a way.Section 8 deals with proceedings relating to offences committed outside the State.  This is a standard provision under which where proceedings are commenced for an offence committed outside the State, they may be taken in any place in the State.  That section is relevant.Section 9 deals with double jeopardy.  This is also a standard provision under which a person cannot be proceeded against for a trafficking or selling or purchasing human beings offence if he or she has been acquitted or convicted of a similar offence in another country.  I have major concerns about this section but we have to tease it out more and be conscious of it.  I emphasise the importance of training for people who work with adults, those who work in the immigration service, at our ports and in the Garda Síochána.  We have got to be constantly vigilant and to ensure that those who work in these services have their eye on the ball and have the maximum training to see these things coming through the system.  They have to be very professional and sensitive to the needs of families and children.  I do not blame families from very poor countries who want to get out of their own country and come to a country where there is a great deal of wealth and resources.  We do not want that debate lumped in with this debate.Many people come to European countries to create a better life for themselves and they make a massive contribution to our country also.  The reality is that the Celtic tiger would not have developed were it not for the immigrant workers who came here and assisted the Irish people to develop this nation.  It is important to be constantly on guard against any elements of racism that emerge in the broader society.  As legislators we have a duty and a responsibility to stand up and be counted to ensure we have respect for all races, creeds and colours in the modern new Ireland.  That is the direction in which we are going and there are many positive angles to it.Section 10 deals with exclusion of members of the public from proceedings.  This section gives the judge power to exclude persons from the court, other than officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings and such other persons as the judge may determine, during proceedings for trafficking or selling purchasing offences under this Bill.  This will ensure a lack of publicity surrounding cases where persons are alleged to have been trafficked in circumstances where publicity might place them and their families at risk.  This is a strong and important section because we have got to focus on and respect and protect the rights of victims.  We cannot have a situation where families are put at risk, particularly in court.This is a matter that should be seriously considered in a broader criminal justice system.  We have to ensure people and their rights are protected, where organised crime, pornography, exploitation of children and human trafficking is involved.  We have to be vigilant to ensure we separate the innocent from the guilty.  At all times we must be sensitive to the needs of victims and, particularly in this case, young families.  That is the reason section 10 is important.  It also provides safeguards for people's rights.Section 11 deals with the anonymity of victims of trafficking.  This section guarantees the anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking, unless the judge fully or partially waives the anonymity in the interests of justice.  Breach of this section could have serious consequences for an alleged victim.  Accordingly, an offence under this section will be triable on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of an unlimited fine and-or ten years imprisonment.On the broader issue of modern day slavery, that this debate is taking place and the Bill is going through the House is a sad reality that despite all the wealth and resources and the many excellent services in place there are sections of people who are constantly exploited.  If these people come from poor and disadvantaged countries we must ensure they are supported, politically, socially and economically.  Aid must be provided to these countries on a regular basis but it should be given honestly and to the people on the ground in the communities and not wasted by corrupt governments or corrupt officials.  We should listen to the advice from many of our voluntary organisations in these countries.On the question of exploitation of children and human trafficking we have to be vigilant in respect of a section of our population, young children brought up in dysfunctional families who see things that many adults would not see in a lifetime.  These children are at risk.  Programmes need to be in place to assist these children to have a normal childhood.  One cannot expect the child who lives in a drug-fuelled family where there is violence, intimidation and sexual exploitation to have a normal childhood.  That is the sad reality for families in Ireland today.  That is the sad reality we see every day in the children's courts and in many criminal justice cases.  When talking about human trafficking it is important to reflect on these issues because it is all part of the wider debate.  If we are concerned about human trafficking we defend their human rights and do something for them but we must ensure that young people and disadvantaged families are supported.I welcome some of the progressive policies that have been implemented here to assist and prevent this type of situation.  The way forward for many of these young people is early intervention through education and support for families through social and family affairs, the development of quality housing and the demolition of ghettos.I welcome the broader debate.  It is important to support the legislation which deals with the exploitation of young families, children, young boys and girls.  We should not ignore that reality.  We must be supportive of them.  This is round one in the legislation stake.I thank all the people in Dublin North-Central, from Marino, Artane, Beaumont, Coolock, Clontarf, Raheny and across the constituency who sent me letters on the Bill.

What we are doing today is part of the process.  However, we must implement the process and ensure the availability of services to protect the people on the ground.

I compliment the Minister on showing such alacrity in presenting it.  When I was party spokesperson on justice during the last Dáil, a number of times I asked the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite this legislation.  We must remember that a Bill similar to this was on the Order Paper in the previous regime.  However, despite repeatedly promising it the then Minister never delivered.  I am delighted the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has shown such alacrity and he even stated in his remarks that it is one of his major priorities to get it through the House as quickly as possible.In the first instance we have international conventions to implement and to transpose into our legislation.  The introductory section of the Bill makes it clear that the international community has been quite exercised in seeking to put together an international framework for domestic parliaments to take on board.  In modern times the earliest one was the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, done at New York as it relates to trafficking in women and children.  Also included is the European Council framework decision of July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings.  The more recent ones include the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings done at Warsaw on 16 May 2005.  The Council of Europe has a very fine convention on the trafficking of human beings and while it is not included in the reference in the Bill it was included in the Minister's speech.The first step is to transpose into legislation the framework directives coming from the European Union, the United Nations and the Council of Europe into Irish legislation.  The Minister has taken a fairly narrow view in his approach in this regard and deals largely with law enforcement as opposed to human rights.  He is specifically criminalising the activity, and seeks to put in place mechanisms to prevent it taking place and investigate it when it does.  He has told us that he will deal with the central issues of victims, which is the nub of the question, largely in future immigration, residence and protection legislation that he is due to introduce later.  We have been awaiting that Bill for some time and I would like to know when it will appear.  Ideally both Bills should have been taken in tandem perhaps with one Bill going through the other House and then transferring to here because the two are intrinsically connected.  It is not possible to have law enforcement legislation without dealing with the victims of the criminality.As has been said repeatedly in this House, human trafficking represents a modern form of slavery with humans, particularly women and children, being exploited — sexual exploitation, particularly in the case of women and children, and labour exploitation in the case of men, women and children.  For good measure the Minister has thrown in exploitation relating to organ harvesting, which is a particularly foul activity.  However, people are trafficked for that reason also.The organisation with which I have most contact in my constituency is Ruhama, which has been extremely active in dealing with the issue of prostitution and trafficking.  Indeed Ruhama had nothing to do with trafficking until recent years when it found that its work on prostitution was overlapping with its experience of people being trafficked into prostitution here.  While it essentially works with the domestic issue of prostitution by trying to help and resource the women caught up in it and for which it has developed a very good policy, it has found this is compounded by the significant numbers of trafficked women it comes across.  Since the original United Nations document in 2000, Ruhama has come across more than 200 women who were trafficked into Ireland.  Let us remember that Ruhama is a small organisation that only operates in a few areas and is not countrywide.  Clearly the numbers it has come across represent the tip of the iceberg and there may be hundreds if not thousands of people who have been trafficked through the country, which gives rise to the belief that there is a considerable criminal fraternity operating on a global basis bringing people across borders into this country to be exploited in the case of the women Ruhama has met, for sexual exploitation and in other cases for labour exploitation and even organ harvesting.We have been particularly lax in implementing European Union directives that would prevent labour exploitation, including directives on working time and agency workers.  Agency workers represent a major bone of contention.  People can be brought here under the guise of being agency workers as though it is a legal and normal way to bring people across borders into another jurisdiction.  It is very prevalent in this country as Ireland is one of only three countries not to sign up to the European Union directive.  When they come here they are subject to exploitation, as they do not have the normal rights and benefits that accrue from domestic legislation.  This is a scandal for a country that advises the international community that we have perfected the role of partnership with the trade union movement representing workers, the Government and the business sector coming together in a wonderful social partnership for the benefit of the economy and the community at large.  Yet we are allowing this whole category of agency workers to be exploited because we simply will not transpose into Irish law the EU directive on agency workers.  This area cannot be neglected and is not covered by this legislation.  We need to get that directive through the House and into law as quickly as possible.The legislation refers to the removal of organs.  We have all received letters and other communication from representatives of the Falun Gong, who are often to be seen outside this House.  They claim with a certain degree of credibility that some of their members in China have been dealt with in this fashion.  When in detention their organs have been removed and sold for large sums of money.  We must look carefully at how this practice works and consider whether there are incidents of this happening in Ireland and the strong reports that it is happening in China.  Many Chinese who have fled to Ireland are Falun Gong practitioners.We cannot leave this Bill without commenting on the significant number of victims.  The Minister admits that the US figure for global trafficking is 800,000; that at any given time 2.5 million people are in the trafficking-exploitative industry worldwide and that there is transborder activity into 137 countries.I am not sure if the Minister has responded adequately to human trafficking.  We know the Garda National Immigration Bureau is there, but we cannot get a response from it and we do not know how it operates.  He referred to NGOs, but the advice from the NGOs was to present this Bill in a different fashion so as to make the victim central to it.  While he will bring the NGOs on board, he will not bring them on board in the way they had wanted to come on board.  Will he establish the equivalent of the UK human trafficking centre which is working excellently in the UK?  We need a place as a focus for dealing with human trafficking and not an attachment to an existing structure like the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, or a commitment that gardaí will be trained to do it or that he will involve some other agencies and possibly the NGOs.  We need a human trafficking centre where resources will be put in place, where we can observe, monitor, scrutinise and audit what is being done to deal with the tragedy of human trafficking.

Tá sé ríthábhachtach go ndéanann muid plé air mar bhí Teachtaí ar ghach taobh á lorg le blianta anuas.  Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Ruhama as an obair atá déanta acu agus as an iachall a chur siad agus dreamanna eile orainn an reachtaíocht seo a chur ós comhair na Dála.  Beidh reachtaíocht cuíosach foirfe againn nuair a bheidh muid críochnaithe leis na Céimeanna éagsúla má bhíonn an tAire sásta éisteacht leis na buartha atá againn faoi.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh muid in ann déileáil leis na nithe sin ar Chéim an Choiste.While research in terms of precise statistics and figures on the level of trafficking through or within Ireland is sparse, there are indicators that make its existence as a social and human rights problem undeniable.  The report published this month by NUI Galway on trafficking for sexual exploitation identified a probable minimum of 76 women.  In a presentation to the European affairs committee, of which I was a member, Ruhama indicated in 2005 that it was working directly with 32 victims of trafficking and was aware at that stage of another 70 people.  I do not think the numbers would have been reduced in the meantime, but have probably increased.  The 328 unaccompanied children who have gone missing from HSE care in recent years is another frightening indicator that we must face up to the very real issue of trafficking.  This Bill is a start to facing up to this problem.The migrants' rights centre published a report earlier in the year showing that trafficking of forced labour is a problem in Ireland, particularly in restaurants, agriculture, construction, and among domestic workers.  While I am happy that "a child" is defined in the Bill as anyone under 18 years, I hope this indicates a change from the regressive move by a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 10 years in other legislation.Human trafficking necessitates a two pronged approach, a successful criminal prosecution against traffickers and protection and support for the victims of trafficking.  To a great extent these ideals are interdependent.  The overdue Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007, as drafted, introduces new human trafficking offences and is welcome.  However, it does nothing to address the protection of victims.  We have been told that we must wait a little longer for such provisions.  There will be fines for offences of trafficking in children and adults for the purpose of labour exploitation, sexual exploitation and organ collection.  I trust it is the intention of Government to criminalise human trafficking for the purpose of exploitation, but I am worried that in the case of children, the Bill leaves many gaps.  I appeal to the Minister to address these loopholes on Committee Stage.  A child may be trafficked for exploitation in a manner other than the three mentioned, for example for adoption, for welfare benefits or ritualistic sacrifice.In 1998, seven year old Victoria Climbié was trafficked from the Ivory Coast to Europe for the purpose of benefit fraud.  Her aunt promised Victoria's parents that she would give their little girl a better life and educational opportunities.  In February 2000, two years later,Victoria died in a hospital in England, having suffered months of horrific neglect, physical abuse and degrading treatment.  She was just eight years and three months when she died in what was to become one of the worst cases of physical child abuse and exploitation ever documented.  Victoria's aunt and her partner received a life sentence for her murder.  We hope that cases as extreme and horrific as the murder of Victoria are few in number but a higher number of children may be trafficked for benefit fraud.  Those who are arranging to transport them have little or no concern for their welfare as their primary goal is financial.  I recall the case of five year old Adam, whose torso was found in the River Thames in 2004.  It was said that he was trafficked from Nigeria for the specific purpose of ritual killing.  Even though that is very rare, we need to ensure that it is covered.  We must ensure the law has watertight provisions for criminal prosecutions of these offences.  A simple amendment could cover exploitation for financial gain, ritualistic killing and abuse, and adoption and this would increase the potential for successful prosecutions to be taken against all traffickers in human beings.The Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings recognises that victim protection is as important as any part of the approach.  The Government should take all steps necessary to ensure that Ireland signs and ratifies this convention as a matter of urgency.  This would strengthen the Bill.  Provisions in section 12 allowing victims to testify via television link, while welcome, are no substitute for a reflection period or a residency protection.  The Minister has attempted to justify the absence of victim protection from the Bill by saying it will follow in the long awaited immigration and residency Bill.  However, when will that Bill come before the House?  How soon will it come into effect, considering the length of time we have been waiting for the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill?  We should incorporate protection in this Bill to ensure that we have such measures when the Bill is enacted.  The rationale for delaying victim protection until the immigration and residency Bill comes before us is also based on a false premise that all trafficking victims are immigrants.  This may not be true.  Under the definition in the Bill, trafficking is not limited to cross-jurisdictional movements, and it can occur in the State also.The Bill could be improved in terms of victim restitution.  Under the Bill, when a judge is sentencing, he may issue a fine or a prison sentence up to life imprisonment.  The judge should also be empowered to issue an order at that stage mandating a compensation payment to the victim where appropriate.  This is particularly important, given that many victims no longer reside in the State and will not be in a position to pursue a claim for damages through civil court structures.  I urge the Minister to examine this and try to ensure we will have the strongest legislation possible in line with the demands of various groups to all parties in the House to address this issue.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak.  As a parent of two young girls I, like every other parent, have hopes and dreams for them.  When people become involved in trafficking, they are not only destroying the hopes and dreams of the parents but the innocent hopes and dreams of the child concerned whose life is likely to become a horror story.  It is important to end trafficking.  Life is hard enough for everybody without us allowing dreams to be smashed before lives even start.  The recent arrest of traffickers in Holland, Spain, Belgium, Britain, the United States and Ireland is very welcome.  It is important to acknowledge the commitment and effectiveness of those who worked to effect those arrests.  It must be one of the most difficult jobs within the Garda Síochána.  I also acknowledge, as previous speakers have done, the contribution of Ruhama, an organisation which supports the victims of violence against women.  Its workload is increasing.  I urge that supports for it should increase in keeping with its increased workload.Human trafficking is one of the greatest scourges in society and becoming increasingly apparent.  It is defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people for the purpose of exploitation.  In other words, it is modern day slavery.  Many of us would have thought that slavery was long gone.  Abraham Lincoln abolished it in America in 1865.  Great Britain recently marked the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery this year.  Unfortunately — judging from the debate people are saddened by the fact — slavery remains a real and modern phenomenon.  Human trafficking is a global industry.  It is estimated that anywhere between 700,000 and 4 million women and children are trafficked every year.  It is difficult to obtain exact figures, as many cases go under the radar.  These figures serve to remind us of the negative impact of globalisation.  However, it has also had major positive impacts which people recognise.  One of the negative results is increased human trafficking.  While it is easier to carry out financial business transactions across the globe, unfortunately, it is also easier to buy and sell people.Ireland is not immune to this phenomenon.  Human trafficking represents one of the worst violations of human rights, the right to freedom.  What most of us take for granted every day is systematically abused for millions all over the world.  That is why I welcome the publication of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill, the aim of which, to use the words of the Minister, is to make Ireland a more hostile environment for those who might consider trafficking people here.  It criminalises the trafficking of persons for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs or for any reason.  It applies to the trafficking of both adults and children.This legislation will serve to bring Irish law into line with European and international standards.  The offences as outlined in the Bill are in line with the European Union Framework Decision on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which supplements the United Nations Convention Against International Organised Crime and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.  The prohibition of the sale of children for the purpose of exploitation is a requirement of the optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.Not only are we acting to bring domestic legislation into line with international standards, the Bill is also part of a much broader strategy.  I compliment the Minister on not dealing with this matter in isolation but on looking at that broad strategy.  He has announced a new high level group on combating trafficking in human beings, an initiative I very much welcome.  This group will draft a national action plan which will allow Ireland to deal with the broader issues and enable the relevant administrative structures to be put in place.I also welcome the initiative being taken by the Minister on a European level.  We will be taking the lead and hosting an international meeting in Dublin early next year.  We are part of the European G6 initiative involving six member states, the aim of which is to make human trafficking less attractive to potential criminals, to create a hostile environment for them.  To use an old cliché which is very accurate on this occasion, prevention is better than cure.  This represents a proactive and co-operative approach to an interstate problem.The Bill is broadly welcomed by many organisations working in the area of trafficking.  Particularly welcome is section 11 which guarantees the anonymity of alleged victims of trafficking, unless the judge fully or partially waives the anonymity in the interests of justice.  Breach of this section could have serious consequences for an alleged victim.  Accordingly, an offence under it will be triable on indictment with a maximum penalty on conviction of an unlimited fine and-or ten years imprisonment.  However, it is imperative that the rights of the victims continue to be protected.There are four separate aspects to trafficking in persons, one which is the criminal law.  The second includes immigration issues which will be dealt with in the forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  The third is the protection of victims of trafficking and the provision of services for them while they remain in the country.  The fourth is Garda operations and international co-operation with other police forces and agencies to deal with this type of criminality.  I urge the relevant parliamentary committees — I hope to be particularly active on and involved with those committees — to keep in mind the rights of victims in every aspect and at every stage of each Bill and initiative.  It is the human rights of victims of trafficking that we, as legislators, are aiming to protect.  Victims of trafficking have no voice.  They will have experienced traumatic events and will often not be in a position to defend and advocate for themselves.  At a time when the rights of victims and their relatives are top of the agenda, I urge that the rights of those without a voice be prioritised and that the legislation provide the necessary support and protection.  The Minister has prioritised this issue, which I very much welcome.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I thank Deputy Andrews for sharing his time with me.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this timely and important Bill.Human trafficking is one of the vilest of criminal activities.  It is a violation of basic human rights and a modern day form of slavery.  Human traffickers deliberately target the most vulnerable, those affected by desperate economic circumstances, victims of war and those with limited access to the protections we in the West take for granted.  They have a cruel disregard for human suffering and human life and their only interest in those they are trafficking is how much money they can make out of them.  Human trafficking is a global phenomenon and affects almost every country in the world, whether it acts as a source country of the victims of trafficking or as a transit or destination country.Human trafficking is now believed to be the third most profitable criminal enterprise in the world, with profits exceeded only by drugs smuggling and arms trafficking.  In 2004, the US State Department estimated that $9.5 billion was being generated worldwide on an annual basis by human traffickers, with at least $4 billion of this as a result of trafficking for sex slavery.  Estimates have been made that up to 1 million people are trafficked across international borders each year.  Some 70% of the victims of trafficking are female and 50% are children.  The majority of these victims are trafficked with the intention of forcing them into prostitution.This form of human slavery has generally been associated with the developing world, such as the poorer countries of Eastern Europe and with Latin America, Africa and South East Asia.  It is not something that people readily associate with the western world or with Ireland.  But the destination country for the majority of trafficking victims is generally in the West and it would be naive of us to believe it is not an issue which Ireland must face up to.  Thankfully Ireland does not appear to have a problem of human trafficking on the scale of many of our European neighbours and the United Nations report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, ranked Ireland at the lower end of transit or destination countries in Europe.  However, we have seen enough evidence of human traffickers viewing Ireland as both a transit and a destination country to realise that trafficking does exist in Ireland.My own constituency, Wexford, has recently been linked to claims of human trafficking in Ireland, because of the location in the county of Rosslare Europort.  Rosslare was highlighted earlier this year in a BBC "Panorama" documentary which interviewed a Bulgarian human trafficker who claimed to use Rosslare as an access point to Britain.  In fact, a recent report in the Welsh Assembly also claimed that Irish ports such as Rosslare were being used by traffickers to access Wales.However, Wexford's most public and tragic encounter with human trafficking came on 30 November 2001, when a container loaded with furniture left Italy and travelled through Germany to the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium.  In Zeebrugge it was loaded onto a ship which sailed to Belview Port in Waterford.  From Waterford the container was transported to Drinagh business park on the outskirts of Wexford town.  On the morning of 8 December, eight days after the container was loaded, it was opened in Drinagh business park.  Inside were the remains of eight people who had died on the trip from Italy, including four children aged four, nine, ten and 16.  Five people, including a 15 year old boy, survived the trip.  The heartbreaking nature of what was discovered that morning brought home to everyone in Wexford and in the country the cruel disregard for human life which human traffickers exhibit.  The great tragedy of what happened in Wexford was that it came only a year after 58 people lost their lives in similar circumstances in Dover, England.  It seems that loss of life on this scale was not enough to overcome the desperation of some people and the greed and indifference to human suffering of others.I welcome the publication of this Bill and, in particular, the performance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Since taking over as Minister, he has been active and progressive and has led the Government's response to the scourge of human trafficking.  To date there have been approximately 7,000 prosecutions in 20 countries on charges of human trafficking, with 3,000 convictions.  I believe this Bill will allow Ireland to come into line with many other countries which are committed to the eradication of human trafficking.  It will also allow Ireland to comply with the many international commitments we have signed up to at European and United Nations level.I also recognise that the Bill is only one part of the Government's strategy to combat human trafficking.  A new high level group on combating trafficking in human beings is being established with the intention of presenting the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the most effective tactics to fight traffickers in human misery.  The forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007 will also address our treatment of the victims of trafficking.  The Bill will allow Ireland to comply with our obligations under the Council of Europe convention, as well as enshrining in law the recognition that those who are trafficked are victims.Internationally, we are also becoming more active in co-operating with other countries to tackle human trafficking.  The fact that the victims I mentioned earlier, who were found in such tragic circumstances in Wexford, had travelled through Italy, Germany and Belgium before reaching Ireland shows that international co-operation is vital to tackle human trafficking.  Ireland has become involved in the European G6 initiative against human trafficking with Britain, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.  The Garda Síochána is particularly active in co-operating with a number of initiatives based in Britain, such as the human trafficking centre and Operation Pentameter II.  Indeed, the Madeleine McCann case, whatever its outcome, has put the issue of child kidnapping and trafficking top of the agenda.  Last week my five year old nephew, in a reply to a comment I made to him, retorted that he did not want to end up being taken away like Madeleine McCann.  The issue has permeated all levels and ages of society.Ireland as a country cannot become complacent about the problem of human trafficking.  Human trafficking profits on the suffering of others.  The victims of human trafficking are the weakest members of society and are voiceless to seek help.  I welcome this legislation as a response to the problem of human trafficking and I hope it will help to ensure that Ireland never again sees a tragedy like the one witnessed in Wexford on 8 December 2001.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	211	It is with pleasure I welcome this vital legislation before the House today.  However, the Bill is not as far-reaching as I had hoped.  There is an onus on the Government to specifically provide protection for victims of human trafficking but that is completely ignored in the legislation before us today and that is very unfortunate.  Currently Ireland is the only member of the European Union not to have any form of legislation relating to human trafficking so this Bill is long overdue.  Nevertheless, I welcome it.In May 2006, after the two "Prime Time Investigates" programmes which focused on the issue of human trafficking and its prevalence in Ireland, the Government made a commitment to introduce legislation to address the issue.  I am disappointed it took 18 months for that to become a reality, although it is positive that it has now been brought forward.  Human trafficking is a massive international criminal industry, involving prostitution, sexual exploitation and labour exploitation and is something to which we, as an island, have become particularly vulnerable.  We have become a target for human trafficking in recent years, particularly the past decade.  Many people in Ireland, particularly legislators, have turned a blind eye to the problem.  It is a huge human tragedy and affects children and young adult females, who have been used as slaves and pawns in a really brutal and vicious way.I am very pleased with certain aspects of the legislation, particularly those focusing on the penalties which will be imposed for perpetrators and those who facilitate human trafficking and carry out the practice as a major business.  A penalty of life imprisonment is now guaranteed under this legislation and I am very pleased to see that.  However, the failure to provide for victim protection is a major issue.  Government plans to deal with trafficked victims under separate immigration legislation which we will probably not see until next year and that does not reflect the dire need to deal with the problem as a matter of priority.  Immigration legislation has not been published and we do not yet know if it will incorporate full protection for victims.  We have indications from Government benches that it will not and that would be a very sad reflection on how the Government views the urgency and gravity of human trafficking in Ireland at the moment.I urge the Government either to include victim protection in this Bill, so that it is consolidated in the same legislation, which would be the logical thing to do, or to bring forward the immigration legislation which will deal with that lacuna in the law.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with EU Council Directive 2004/81 and, in particular, Article 6, section 1 which states:Member States shall ensure that the third country nationals concerned are granted a reflection period allowing them to recover and escape the influence of the perpetrators of the offence so that they can take an informed decision as to whether to cooperate with the competent authorities.In essence, we in Ireland need urgently to accept that victims of human trafficking are not illegal immigrants but victims who require protection and care.

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	213	All of the facilities and services available to the State need to be invested in meeting and supporting their needs.  It is a tragedy that this directive has not been implemented.  The date for implementation was 6 August 2006 and we have already exceeded this period by a full year.  This exposes the State to potential litigation from a person who falls victim to human trafficking and is not given the protection which the State is mandated to provide under not alone EU legislation but the UN protocol.  An enormous amount of international and European weight is being given to this issue which appears to have been ignored to date by the Government.  I urge the Government to consider including this provision in the Bill before the House or to accelerate the process for the immigration Bill.This issue is timely in light of the arrest today under a European arrest warrant of a person party to a major international child trafficking ring.  The individual will be brought before the High Court next week for an extradition order.  I would like to see greater co-operation between the Irish police and its EU counterparts.  I know an agreement exists between the UK and Irish police but this needs to be extended.  It is a pity Ireland has opted out of the justice and home affairs element of the European reform treaty as this would have provided a wonderful opportunity to further integrate, resource and equip the Garda Síochána with the intelligence and knowledge available to its EU counterparts.  This issue needs to be re-examined.  Perhaps the Government would examine further ways of ensuring integration and co-operation with police forces across EU member states.It is hoped the people suffering at the hands of vicious and greedy perpetrators will be borne in mind in terms of how this legislation is implemented, developed and enhanced in the future.  It is easy to dismiss people brought into this country illegally and traumatised, victimised and used as human slaves.  These people do not have a voice.  An opportunity exists today to try to give them that voice.  I hope that in the course of this debate and the debate on the immigration Bill, the concerns and issues that have affected such victims in the past and will affect them in the future will be aired.  I conclude by stressing the need to take into account the vital importance of protection of victims as this legislation proceeds.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I reject the statement by the Minister time and again on radio that human trafficking is not a problem in Ireland.  That is not true.  It may not be the problem it is in other European countries in terms of scale and numbers but human trafficking is a problem in Ireland on a number of levels.  Organisations such as Ruhama, which has been quoted a number of times, will state definitively that it has, during the past three years, supported more than 200 victims of human trafficking into Ireland.  I urge that the Government parties take note when speaking about human trafficking not to minimise the issue or the problem by repeating the mantra that human trafficking is not really a problem in Ireland.  One person brought to Ireland for the purpose of exploitation and abuse, be it physical, sexual or within the labour force, is one too many.The light was shone on this issue 18 months ago in two consecutive RTE "Prime Time" programmes which highlighted the facts around human trafficking in Ireland and the fact that it is a growing problem.  Approximately 100,000 people within the European Union are trafficked across Borders each year.  Does anyone seriously believe the second wealthiest country in the EU in terms of income per capita is going to be immune from that problem because it is an island?  We also have a problem in terms of Ireland being used as a trafficking route into the United Kingdom.  This has been confirmed by a BBC report.  Anyone who watched that programme would have heard a Bulgarian criminal openly speaking about the easy access into the United Kingdom through Irish ports.  That is a problem.The recent Welsh Assembly report on human trafficking specifically fingers Ireland as one of the routes into Wales for the purposes of trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation and to feed the sex industry in Wales and the remainder of Britain.  Let us stop putting our heads in the sand and saying human trafficking is not a problem in Ireland.  It is a problem and we need to deal with it.  The introduction of this legislation is a good first step in attempting to deal with it although I have some problems with it.  I will come back to them later.Let us get the language right first and recognise that on this island we have a problem, although unbelievable for many people, in terms of the trafficking of vulnerable people into Ireland for the purposes of abuse and exploitation.  Also, Irish people are willing to pay for the services of these people knowing they are being exploited and abused.  Although this is an unpleasant reality, it is about time we faced it.As Ireland becomes wealthier, more liberal, multicultural and open to immigrants wishing to work and live here, the reality is the problem will continue to grow unless we deal with it in a comprehensive way.  I have been a member of an organisation called Stop the Traffik for quite some time.  The organisation which was established in the European Parliament in Brussels more than a year ago is an umbrella organisation that is trying to raise the profile of this issue internationally.  The mantra of this organisation is basically summed up in three words in terms of how we need to deal with trafficking: prevention, prosecution and protection.This legislation effectively deals with the prosecution element in that it defines trafficking in adults for the first time in Irish law and that is welcome.  We have put in place appropriate criminal sanctions for the offence of trafficking which is also welcome.  However, the legislation does not deal with the other two areas on which we need to concentrate.

Accordingly, detailed questions on the issue would be more appropriately addressed to them.On the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I understand that final agreement on the proposal for a directive to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community is subject to the approval of the European Parliament and the European Council, which has yet to be secured.  Without clarity on the final details of the proposed operation and implementation arrangements, it is not possible to assess accurately the tourism impacts on Ireland.  The Government supports, in principle, the proposal to include aviation in the emissions trading system.  From a tourism viewpoint, I understand that the proposal is regarded as the least worst option, so to speak, in that it is preferable to application of energy taxes, en route charges or other measures to disincentivise customers from travelling by air.I understand that the impact assessment carried out by the European Commission on its original proposal suggests that, "the maximum impact for regions whose tourism income depends fully on inbound air travel would be a decrease in tourist arrivals of 1% to 5% compared to a business as usual scenario".Tourism, by definition, is dependent on transport and Ireland, as an island nation, depends overwhelmingly on air access.  Considerably more than 80% of our visitors come by air and 80% of our tourism revenue comes from overseas tourists.  Developing greater and more competitive air access has been and remains a key tourism policy priority for Ireland.  Ireland's best prospects for medium and long-term tourism growth will be critically dependent on air access.General policies which seek to restrict or significantly inhibit air travel can impact disproportionately on island member states such as Ireland and discriminate against the peripheral regions.  It could be argued they are not in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and, therefore, we should be vigilant in arguing our position on this front.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	216	This is my first official opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him well.I accept the Minister's point that this is a cross-cutting issue but it has specific relevance for tourism.  Does the Minister agree that the introduction of any tax on aviation fuel, including carbon trading taxes, has serious implications for Ireland?  There are no available alternatives so that a tax on aviation fuel can only reduce air travel into Ireland.  Does the Minister agree that such an objective is not consistent with other national objectives and that we need a debate on the broader topic of taxes?  The Minister remarked that it is the least harmful of taxes.  If a direct carbon tax, which I understand is also being considered, is raised at EU level, I ask the Minister that we at least have a national debate on what we want to achieve.  Carbon taxes on aviation can only reduce travel into Ireland.  As well as affecting tourism, it will affect trade, compound our disadvantage as an island nation, increase the isolating effect of living on an island and erode many of the benefits we have derived in recent years from increased air travel into and out of Ireland.Will the Minister talk to his colleagues with responsibility for transport and energy?  As Irish tourism depends largely on the North American market and because the European land mass is very small, this measure will militate particularly against Ireland and could work to the advantage of countries such as Norway and Switzerland which are not in the EU and will not be subject to the tax.  In the context of the open skies policy, it is critical that we are alert to the major competitive issues for Ireland.  I ask the Minister to keep those things in mind.

There is a dilemma in our arguing at European level to reduce aviation emissions because by doing so we create a disincentive to travel by air.  However, one can square the circle somewhat.  Experts say that modern technology permits larger aircraft built with materials which cause smaller emissions and are technologically friendlier.  One need not, therefore, greatly reduce the number of people travelling because they will simply be transported more efficiently.  By including this in the emission trading scheme, we keep pressure on the aviation industry to continue to invest in such technology and to ensure it comes to the fore.I acknowledge that a certain squaring of the circle is needed.  On the one hand we must reduce emissions and on the other we must grow tourism.  Tourism has been growing rapidly and we can continue to develop it while playing our part in reducing carbon emissions.

I have agreed to remain in contact with both the GPA and the GAA and I hope this issue can be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.

It is important the issue is resolved.  It has dragged on for almost five years.  I appreciate that efforts are being made to resolve the matter and I understand there is goodwill on all sides.  The Minister has met separately the GPA and the GAA.  It would be productive if he could arrange to meet with the two organisations together to try to resolve the issue.Does the Minister understand the GAA would have serious concerns regarding infrastructure funds being used for the proposed purposes?  Does he have concerns in that regard?

Much good work has been done in the background to try to move this matter on.  I have arranged for ongoing discussions between all sides.  In the course of the coming weeks, I am confident that those discussions will come to a satisfactory conclusion.  All sides are keeping the lines of communication open and are having discussions with each other.  We are all doing so with a sense of goodwill and in a genuine attempt to reach a solution to what has been a fairly intractable issue for some time.  I share the Deputy's view that considerable goodwill exists on all sides.  I had good meetings with the GAA and the GPA and I am satisfied, following those meetings, that there is substantial goodwill on both sides.  I have arranged ongoing discussions between them and I am hopeful they will bear fruit soon.

As indicated by the GPA, strike action is a danger, which would disrupt the inter-county games beginning in the new year.  That must be avoided at all costs, as that will serve nobody.  Has the Irish Sports Council a role in managing this issue?

The council could be of considerable assistance.  I pay tribute to inter-county players.  They take a great deal of time off for training and they make a fantastic commitment.  Playing inter-county nowadays is not like 20 years ago because it demands an enormous time commitment on the part of players and their families.  It is important that such effort is recognised by everybody, given the sheer work they put into inter-county games and the commitment they make.  We should also salute the GAA on the magnificent commitment the organisation shows in every parish in the State.  I thank its officials for that.  I would like to bring this dispute to an early conclusion.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The funding of the Arts Council, as with all departmental and State agencies, is a matter for consideration under the annual budget and Estimates process.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.  I am aware of the Arts Council's desire to have multiannual budgets, having met the Council on a number of occasions.  I appreciate the need for stability in budgeting which such a measure would provide.  My Department, like all other Departments, is provided with annual current expenditure budgets through the Estimates process.  The programme for Government commits to providing multiannual funding to the Arts Council that identifies key areas for development, for organisations or key strategies in the arts.  Multiannual current funding for the Arts Council is an issue I will pursue with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.Funding for the council has increased by almost 68%, from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007.  These are significant amounts of taxpayers' money in any context and they have transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts.  The Government's commitment to the arts is evidenced by these substantial increases in funding.  This has enabled the Arts Council to dramatically increase the number of organisations it supports and the funding it provides.  For instance, in 2006 the Arts Council supported 330 regularly funded organisations, which employ 2,000 people; 170 festivals; 251 artists, through bursaries provided to members of Aosdána; and 41 artists in residence programmes, spread across hospitals, schools, communities and prisons.  A number of new initiatives have been introduced by the Arts Council as a result of this additional funding, including touring, small festivals and opera.  I am pursuing funding for the council in 2008, with all aspects of arts funding, as we work to conclude the 2008 Estimates process.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Nobody would deny additional money has been invested in the arts in recent times and much has been achieved.  However, multiannual funding was promised in the programme for Government.  The Minister accepts it makes good sense and such funding is widely used in other areas, for instance, transport, for which a 15-year plan is in place.  Why not provide multiannual funding for the arts?  While it is a budget issue, it not only comes down to additional funding but also certainty in budgeting so that realistic planning can take place.  The regularly funded organisations prepared three-year plans based on the promise in the programme for Government and the Arts Council has tried to respond.  However, it is not reasonable to ask the council to provide three-year budgets when it is only guaranteed funding on an annual basis.The Minister will accept it takes more than one year to put together productions, market them in advance and take them on tour around the country.  From a tourism perspective, if people wish to market a festival, the programmes must be sent to the printers at least 12 months in advance.   A soloist for a chamber orchestra must be hired 24 months in advance and the same is true for many other disciplines.  The Minister must accept the multiannual programme is not only about providing additional funding but also about achieving better value for money.  I ask him to consider that.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The programme for Government commits us to multiannual funding to the Arts Council, which should identify key areas for development for organisations or key strategies in the arts and to ensure increased arts activity is sustained and developed.  The Government is committed to moving in that direction, particularly where key areas for development can be ring-fenced.  Funding for the council has increased spectacularly by 68% from €47 million in 2002 to €80 million this year.  That represents a significant commitment by the Government and its predecessor to invest in the arts.  I pay tribute to the Arts Council, which deals with 330 regularly funded organisations, which employ 2,000 people, and 170 festivals.  The council funds a range of organisations, events and causes under its remit.  I am committed to examining how we can move forward on multiannual funding but it should not hold back the council because successive Ministers in recent years have ensured major increases in funding.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Given that more funding has been invested in the arts, more venues have been established and they must be filled.  A good touring product is needed to fill them.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of alarming stories in various parts of the State about wonderful facilities that have been provided from public money, which are underutilised.  The reason I push for multiannual funding is the necessity for value for money in making these investments.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, €184 million has been allocated for the provision of public swimming pools under the local authority swimming pool programme.  The programme provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new public swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing public pools provided by local authorities themselves or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.  In 2007, the subhead provision for this programme is €25 million and this amount is expected to be spent by the end of 2007.There are four principal stages which must be undertaken by a local authority in developing a swimming pool project.  These are preliminary report, including a feasibility study; contract documents; tender stage; and finally construction stage.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender is approved.  The Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage.The current round of the programme, which has been closed to new applicants since July 2000, provides for maximum grant aid of €3.8 million per project and the policy since 2000 has been to give priority to the completion of the 57 projects within the round.  Of these 57 projects, 28 have been completed and 14 are under construction or about to start construction, all of which have been grant-aided.  Some 15 other projects are at various stages of the programme, with three at tender stage, eight at contract documents stage and four at preliminary report stage.  For the information of the Deputy and the House, I propose to circulate with the Official Report details of where each of the 57 projects fits within the programme.Additional information not give on the floor of the House.Cumulative grant expenditure under the programme from 2000 to the end of this year is anticipated to be €108 million and this grant aid has leveraged total investment of €327 million in public swimming pool facilities.  Currently my Department is completing a value-for-money and policy review report of the local authority swimming pool programme.  The report is examining, among other matters, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.The report is currently being finalised and it is my intention to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of the recommendations in the report, it is my intention to launch a new round of the local authority swimming pool programme.  When the programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities to submit applications under the terms that will apply.Status of individual swimming pool projects under the current round (closed 31 July, 2000) of the Local Authority Swimming Pool ProgrammePROJECTS COMPLETED (28)Arklow (Refurbish) — official opening January 2000Courtown/Gorey (New) — opened October 2001Dundalk (New) — official opening March 2002Ennis (New) — official opening September 2003Enniscorthy (New) — official opening January 2000Monaghan (Refurbish) — re-entered programme for replacementNavan (New) — official opening August 2000Wicklow (New) — (Sept 99) official opening June 2001Roscommon (Refurbish) — official opening April 2002AquaDome, Tralee (Refurbish) — opened 2003Ballinasloe (Replace) — official opening October 2003Finglas, Dublin (Replace) — opened April 04Grove Island, Limerick (New) — opened June 04Sports and Leisure Centre, Tralee (Refurbish) — opened July 04Clonmel (Refurbish) — opened December 04Churchfield, Cork City (Refurbish) — official opening June 05Ballymun, Dublin City (Replace) — opened June 05Tuam, Co Galway (Replace) — opened Sept 05Drogheda, Co Louth (Replace) -opened May 2006Monaghan town (Replace) — opened 19 August 2006Cobh, Co Cork (Replace) — opened 30 August 2006Youghal, Co Cork (New) — opened 18 September 2006Jobstown, South County Dublin (New) — opened 13 November 2006Ballybunion, Co Kerry (New) — June 2007Birr, Co.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I know the Minister is fairly familiar with the swimming pool programme for a variety of reasons.  As he rightly pointed out, the last round closed for applications in 2000.  It is on the national primary school curriculum that every child should have swimming lessons, so to have to wait seven or eight years or even longer to even apply for the scheme clearly shows the problems with it.The maximum amount available is €3.8 million but the average payment out of the allocated money is less than €2 million per pool.  A pool costs about €10 million to build, so the cap is too low and too little is allocated.  The timescale is far too long.  How can it be that a scheme which closed in 2000 still has not re-opened, despite a significant need?  Even with the pools around the country, many must virtually be levelled and started over again.There is a major problem that must be considered.  How can it be that it has taken seven years to deal with 57 projects?  I cannot remember how much has been spent on these projects but I know €184 million is allocated for the next seven years.  How much of the money allocated for the next seven years will go to applications from the last seven years?  There is clearly not enough money if there is an overhang, and the applications made in 2000 still have not been dealt with as we head to 2008.  The Minister must look at the problem.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	233	There is €25 million in the 2007 subhead, which will be spent in 2007.  I take the Deputy's point.  There are 57 projects either completed, open, under construction, out to tender or at contract document stage, so there has been significant activity in this area.  Considerable funds have been invested by the taxpayer.Two things will now happen.  My Department is to complete a value-for-money policy review of the entire programme which will examine how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required.  The report is currently being finalised and I intend to publish it as soon as possible.  Following consideration of that report it is my intention to launch a new round of the local authorities swimming pool programme.  I am not in a position to put a date on that yet.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides €184 towards swimming pool projects, which is quite considerable.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Does the Minister know what is the overhang of the schemes which applied in 2000?  How many still have to draw down the money provided by the original round?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Some $25 million will be provided in 2007, the main overhang as the Deputy called it, in the sense that the money available in 2007 will be used to finish the 57 projects.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	236	It will clear them.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	238	That will be all of the phases.

Some 14 are under construction and three are out to tender.  The €25 million is available in the Estimates this year to complete the 14 under construction and deal with those out to tender.  If the Deputy is concerned the new allocation of €184 will be eaten into by the old programme, I do not believe it will.  I will check that again.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The money allocated to each project is far too little, as the Minister knows.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The Minister for Transport is finalising an economic and tourism development plan for the wider Shannon Airport catchment area which has been prepared in consultation with the Departments of Finance; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; and my own Department.  The plan seeks to help the region respond to the challenges and opportunities emerging in the context of the EU-US open skies agreement.Tourism agencies are acutely aware of the need to respond in a positive way to these challenges and both officials from my Department and I have been in dialogue with them about this.  In the context of open skies, the Government is committed, under its programme, to providing "marketing support to the Shannon region for a transitional period to help consolidate existing markets and develop new sources of business".In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, an appropriate tourism initiative has been formulated in the context of the development of the plan and I expect that, subject to approval of the plan, fuller details will emerge shortly.  The Government has made no commitment to the specific sum of money mentioned by the Deputy, and both my predecessor and myself have made it clear that demands for funding should be realistic.Subject to final approval, I would expect the initiative to focus on the wider western catchment, from Kerry to Donegal; be within the existing super-regions framework, in very close co-operation with the tourism agencies and key local industry interests with which I have already been in contact; and to be innovative, creative and have a strong digital media content.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I thank the Minister.  I accept the figure came from the regional authority but it was certainly led to believe by the previous Minister for Transport that the amount would be forthcoming.  It now appears their plan, which involved all the stakeholders putting that plan together, is being dropped in favour of a plan coming from the various Departments involved.  It is coming far too late.Leaving aside what has happened with the Heathrow slots since, this package was meant to help the region benefit from the open skies agreement, not to find itself being disadvantaged by it.  We have known about this for years and the promise was made to provide a package to help the region capitalise on the possibilities of open skies.  Other airlines, airports and countries have been securing their markets and arranging transatlantic routes while Ireland has been sitting on its hands.  There has been no active aviation policy coming from this country.Considering we are an island country largely dependent on aviation, a sector that is very volatile, we cannot have either a passive or reactive aviation policy.  It must be aggressive, on the ball and anticipate problems.  Does the Minister accept this package is, if not too late, needed urgently?  It must be quickly put together.  What kind of timescale is involved?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	It is a matter of urgency that we get on with this package, and much of it is being dealt with in the context of the upcoming Estimates and budgetary process.  We should approach part of the issue in that manner.  I had a very good meeting recently with the Irish Hotels Federation and I also met with various bodies in the Shannon region.  I had good discussions with their representatives in recent days regarding how we can best prepare the region for open skies and in respect of the challenging and competitive environment that exists.Shannon can continue to avail of a growing tourism market.  I will not bore Members by referring to the statistics but it is clear the numbers of visitors to the region have been increasing, as have visitor revenues.  For the first seven months of this year, the numbers coming into the region increased significantly.  In my opinion, the region can continue to avail of a strong growth in inward tourism by remaining competitive.  The Minister for Transport is preparing the plan and he will bring it forward as soon as our work in respect of it concludes.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I realise the Minister does not have sole responsibility for this matter.  He did, however, refer to preparing for open skies.  It is too late to do so because open skies is already with us.  I ask the Minister to impress on his colleagues in Cabinet the urgency relating to his matter.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	246	We have been discussing open skies for a long period.  It will be next year before flights begin to operate under this policy.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The effects are already with us.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Everyone must do what he or she can to prepare Shannon for that eventuality.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 14 together.The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations and, in certain circumstances, sports and colleges, throughout the country.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Under the programme, priority is given to the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilitiesPrimary and post-primary schools wishing to be considered for funding under the programme may apply for it jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must meet other conditions including a requirement that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility, at least 30 hours a week throughout the year, when it is not being used by the school itself.  Any sports facility proposed for funding by a sporting organisation, and which would be located within school grounds, would have to meet these same conditions.  Applications from primary and post-primary schools and colleges on their own are not considered under the programme.  Responsibility for the provision of sports facilities in schools and colleges is a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.My Department has commenced work on the development of a national sports facility strategy that will advocate a planned approach to the provision of sports facilities at both local and national level.  An inter-agency steering group has been established to oversee this work and includes representation from my Department and the Department of Education and Science.  The work of this group has included discussions with the Department of Education and Science on how its policy on the provision of sports hall facilities and my Department's policy for the provision of sports facilities might be complementary.  The issues raised by the Deputies will be addressed in the development of the new strategy for sports facilities.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome the Minister's reply and thank him for it.  These questions were tabled because, like most people, Members are concerned that so many children never come into contact with sport.  In many cases they are unhealthy and obese and are not excelling in sport.  I do not need to indicate to the Minister the benefits that accrue to a generation of children exposed to sport at a young age.  Such children carry those benefits with them throughout their lives.  However, there are children who go through primary and secondary school without ever visiting a sports hall.We are doing something wrong.  Every child has a right to become involved in sport.  Money is being invested in programmes relating to disadvantaged areas but these largely help children who are in any way self-selecting.  No matter how disadvantaged, a motivated parent will push his or her child forward.  Clubs do great work but they tend to cherry-pick the best children.  Every child deserves to and should be exposed to sport.  The State has an obligation to ensure that children have access to sport.The corollary to this is that where facilities are provided in schools at public expense, such facilities must remain open for use after 5 p.m. each evening and at weekends.  Will the Minister indicate the progress that is being made in respect of this issue?  I accept that it is a condition for future funding in respect of facilities in schools.  However, there are schools throughout the country that have facilities — even if, for example, these are only basic playgrounds — which are locked up and which children cannot access.  This is an important matter, particularly in the context of the numbers of working parents who cannot and who do not have the time to bring their children to sports facilities outside their areas.  All primary schools have some form of facilities and these should be made available to local children.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I have asked those responsible for the new national sports facility strategy to examine that matter.  I take the Deputy's point.  Since 1998, approximately €700 million has been allocated to 6,700 projects under the sports capital programme.  This means that an enormous number of projects are spread throughout the country.  It was extremely important for the nation that we spent that money on these projects.  Having expended that money, we can now give careful consideration to the stock of facilities that are available.  In the audit relating to the national sports facility strategy and in preparing for another round of sports capital programme funding, we must assess the areas in which facilities owned by schools and colleges complement public facilities.  This is to ensure duplication does not occur, while also ensuring complementary facilities are available.  It is in this direction  the emphasis will now lie.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	252	It might be better to address my question directly to the Minister for Education and Science.  However, many schools have either no PE facilities or have facilities that are completely inadequate.  Apart from the points raised by Deputy Mitchell regarding obesity, the need for PE etc., sooner or later PE is going to become a recognised school subject.  We will then find ourselves in a situation where a subject that will be extremely attractive to many youngsters will be put in place but where the facilities necessary to allow them to avail of it will not be available.Certain parts of my constituency would be regarded as disadvantaged and I am aware of the lack of facilities at some of the schools in these areas.  Even when schools have sports halls, they often lack sufficient financial support to allow them to provide gym kits for students.  Will the Minister comment on the need to provide broader support in respect of PE, particularly in the context of its becoming a school subject.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	A total of 54 joint applications involving schools and colleges and their local communities were received last year and a sum of €1.4 million was allocated to 13 school-based projects.  There is scope, and the opportunity exists, for our educational institutions to partner communities in seeking to develop sports facilities.On the broader point, all the relevant research shows that sport and exercise are enormously beneficial — particularly in therapeutic and physical terms — to young people and adds greatly to their character.  It is, therefore, incumbent on the State to provide the maximum level of facilities.  As already stated, over a nine-year period almost 7,000 projects were funded by the taxpayer under the sports capital programme.  If one travels throughout the country, one can see the enormous benefits that have emanated from these projects.  What are normally referred to as minority sports also have been strongly supported.  However, further co-operation, consultation and integration is required between my Department and the Department of Education and Science as regards sport.  I engage in further work to ensure this happens and that we achieve the type of objective to which the Deputy refers, namely, a better, healthier lifestyle for students.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I agree with the comments made by everybody here regarding the importance of sport.  As someone who was a teacher for 30 years, I realise the importance of this.  Deputy Mitchell made the point about the use of facilities in schools for communities.  It is a hugely important and burning matter and raises a number of issues, such as the question of insurance.  I do not know whether this has been, or can be, overcome.  There is also a fear among school principals that if their facilities are opened up, they will be closing up at 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.  The idea is fantastic but the process needs to be thought through to make it a win-win for everybody.For too many years, physical education has been a joke in the sense it is supposed to be part of the curriculum but is pushed out because of the points race and the pressure on everybody and is regarded as an interference.  That attitude must change.  My experience of working with young people, both on the sports field and in the education field, has shown me that the disciplines they learn in sport can be carried into their academic careers and that they can cope better with their academic careers by letting off steam or their frustrations in sport.  I do not see these things as problems, rather, I see them as huge opportunities.  However, physical education has not been taken seriously up to now and there is a great opportunity for the Government and all of us involved to do this now.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Deputy Doyle has a brief supplementary question.  We must then conclude discussion regarding these questions.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	256	One of the difficulties faced by some organisations is that they do not own or have a 35-year lease on the grounds or facilities.  This issue is probably relevant to national lottery funding as well as sports capital funding.  Is the sports strategy review group addressing this issue?  People find themselves in a chicken and egg situation.  They cannot move because they cannot get the funding.  They cannot get the 35-year or long-term lease because they cannot afford to purchase it without that sort of funding being made available.In respect of trying to develop co-operation with existing educational facilities, such facilities do not want to and cannot lease their properties or grounds to an organisation that might use them.  The organisation cannot then get access to funding without having a lease so this is something that must be looked at, particularly in respect of national lottery funding for the ongoing running of organisations.  Many of these clubs are marginal.  They are not the GAA or soccer clubs of this world.  They are different athletic clubs and need land, which is a scarce commodity, but cannot afford to either lease or buy it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Very practical issues have been raised by Deputies relating to insurance, leases and how all this can be dealt with.  I will ask the sports facility strategy group through the national audit of local sports facilities that is under way to examine those issues.As we invest heavily in bricks and mortar, which we have done very substantially for ten years, we must also continue to invest in and examine the extent to which we need to invest in the software side of it, as opposed to the hardware side.  We can have many fine bricks and mortar projects but we need to bring on the people, including the professional support and volunteer background people, who will give us the athletes and performers.  We must ensure we maintain a balance between investment in what I call the hardware side of sport and the software side.  We must not get this too far out of balance or we will regret it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 52 together.I refer the Deputies to my response to Priority Question No. 3.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	259	In his reply, the Minister referred to his response to Priority Question No. 3 today.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Does this mean I cannot ask a question?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	261	No, it does not.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	262	It relates to multi-annual funding for the Arts Council.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	263	This is about increased, as opposed to multi-annual, funding.  I will not labour the point except to say that there is an inescapable logic that if one sees the arts strategy — partnership for the arts — as desirable through increasing access to the arts at regional or other levels in society, such as schools or prisons, we must fund it.  I made the point about the need to use the facilities, get value and maximise the potential of the considerable investment that has been made, as the Minister noted, in the hardware side of the arts.  I ask the Minister to keep in mind that we must now invest in the people.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Multi-annual funding is very important for certain groups.  The point was made to me that, for example, if one wants to engage an opera singer to perform, it will be vastly expensive and possibly must be arranged two or three years in advance.  If one is working on a year-to-year basis, it is impossible to make those kinds of arrangements.It is also very demanding for smaller groups when they try to fund and plan on any long-term basis.  They are disadvantaged if funding is only provided on an annual basis.  Perhaps the Minister would take this on board.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I made the point earlier that I am committed to examining how we can move in that direction in the context of particular areas within the remit of the Arts Council.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I have no statutory function for the matters referred to by the Deputy.  The issuing of coats of arms and the administration of the Genealogical Office and Office of the Chief Herald are both the responsibility of the statutory board of the National Library of Ireland under sections 12 and 13 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.I have been advised that the board of the National Library has lifted its temporary suspension on the granting of arms on foot of legal advice it has received which is to the effect that under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the board can exercise the heraldic powers provided for in the Act.  The board has also recently referred this advice to my Department as it has a bearing on certain functions discharged by the National Library prior to its corporatisation in May 2005.  My departmental officials are considering this legal advice in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General as to what legislative action, if any, may be required.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I like to think that my question instigated that response.  I am very pleased the Attorney General has suggested that the legislation that is in place is sound, if possibly not as robust as it should be.  Is the Minister contemplating legislation to make, as he suggested, the existing legislation, which empowers the Office of the Chief Herald to issue coats of arms, more succinct?  What is the problem?  Can we retrospectively deal with the fact that there was no statutory basis for 40 or 50 years?  This was slightly embarrassing for us.  I am sure this can be resolved but could we move to do so before there is any more egg on our face?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I advise anyone planning to pull down their coat of arms over their mantelpiece, as well as the shotgun, to hold off for a while.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Action is on the way.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Action is on the way.  It is not necessary to destroy one's coat of arms yet or take it off one's gate——
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The Minister can see how effective I am.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Between 1949 and 2005 there was probably no power to grant the coats of arms that were being granted at the time by the Genealogical Office under the Chief Herald.  In 1997, legislation passed by these Houses effectively legalised or regularised the post of Chief Herald.  The legislation provides that "The Board shall, from time to time as occasion requires, designate a member of its staff to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms and such member shall use the appellation Chief Herald of Ireland or, in the Irish language, PríorahAralt na hÉireann while performing such duties."I am advised by the Attorney General that if we want to be absolutely certain that those coats of arms that were issued between 1949 and 2005 are all above board, we probably need to introduce a short Bill.  His office assures me that would regularise the position.  There is no difficulty at present because the Attorney General has advised that the Chief Herald can carry on with his duties.  I am sure that is an enormous relief to everybody in the House.

This issue has been kicked around like a football, to use a sporting term, between everybody and anybody with references to 1922, 1943, 1997 and 2005.  I hope the legislation required, however short and hopefully not too demanding, will be introduced quickly and that the matter will be finally resolved.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Minister can expect it to have our full support.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	279	On a serious note, there is a tourism aspect to this issue which has been useful for the country and I would like to build on that.  With the large number of our people throughout the world, this country requires a good professional genealogical service, which I believe we have.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 57 together.The Government has provided €149 million in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for the development of a national sports campus at Abbotstown.  The Government, in November 2005, already approved the development of facilities under phase one of a development control plan prepared by Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited, the predecessor of the National Sports Campus Development Authority, NSCDA.  These facilities will be designed to meet the indoor and outdoor training needs of Irish elite sportspersons who compete at national and international levels and will also provide for the needs of the local community.The facilities to be provided in phase one of the project will include a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey; a national indoor training centre which will provide world-class training facilities for more than 20 national governing bodies of sport; accommodation for sports men and women; sports science-medical facilities; and all-weather synthetic pitches for community use.The Government decision for this stage of development included agreement to relocate the headquarters of the Football Association of Ireland to the former State Laboratory building at Abbotstown.  Planning permission for a change of use for the State Laboratory was secured and the refurbishment work on the building is almost complete.  It is expected the FAI will relocate to Abbotstown perhaps later this month.It is also intended to provide a headquarters for the Institute for Sport by refurbishing an existing building on the site and a planning application for a change of use for this building has been lodged with Fingal County Council.The Deputy will be aware the Government also decided to provide a site on the lands for the development of a hospice.  In this context, St. Francis Hospice is involved in the planning stages of this facility.A planning study for the Abbotstown site, which is a requirement under a local objective of the Fingal county development plan, has been completed by an inter-agency group, which included my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance and Fingal County Council.  This study sets out the mix of sporting, leisure, and amenity facilities that would be appropriate for the site.  The planning study, including a proposal to change the zoning of a large portion of the site to open space to allow for sports use and for the woodland area of the site to be zoned high amenity, has been considered by Fingal County Council.  Following a period of consultation, the planning study was approved at a meeting of Fingal County Council on 9 July last.In formal terms, the resulting variation to the Fingal county development plan specifies or maps five local objectives as follows: to provide sporting facilities and associated infrastructure related to the national sports campus incorporating appropriate office, administration and accommodation space; to provide sport and recreational facilities for community use, including minority sport and leisure activities, with local clubs, voluntary organisations and Fingal County Council having an input into the future allocation of space or facilities and with facilities being affordable and accessible to the local population; to provide for a hospice; to provide public access to this open parkland and provide the necessary footpath network, landscaping and related development; and that development of the Abbotstown sports campus and site be accompanied by frequent public transport links as a priority to allow access for the mostly young users of the sports and recreational facilities.Preliminary planning for phase one has commenced and the NSCDA is shortly to appoint a design team and a project management team for the project.  It is then the intention of the authority to have detailed plans prepared so that planning permission can be sought for the implementation of phase one of the project.  It is expected that planning permission will be sought during 2008.In January last, under the National Sports Campus Development Authority Act 2006, the NSCDA was established on a statutory basis to succeed in function and responsibility Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Company Limited, CSID.  In addition to overseeing the development of phase one of the campus, the new authority has been requested to identify the facilities that might be considered for the next phase of the development of the Abbotstown project.  The Abbotstown facilities, when completed, will provide a much needed range of training and competitive facilities for our sportspersons.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The issue of this sports campus is another old chestnut.  We have been talking about it for as long as I have been elected to this House, namely, some ten years.I am pleased to note that Fingal County Council has changed its development plan to facilitate the development of the sports campus at Abbotstown, but I am disappointed we are still far removed from earth being turned on the site.  I understand the design team has not yet been appointed.  Once the team is appointed, its members must design the sports campus.  Phase one of the project is a fairly large development and it will take time to complete.  Once the design is completed, planning permission will have to be sought and then tendering for the construction work will take place.  It seems it will be another five years before any physical work commences on the site.Will the Minister do what he can to inject some urgency into progressing this project?  This is a good time to build a development such as this one because building workers from the housing sector are becoming available and, therefore, labour is available.  Also, good prices can be secured for the work.  While it is a good time to build such a development, we need to get on with it and avail of the opportunities that exist in the market given the slight slowdown in other sectors of the building industry.  The main issue is to get the sports campus up and running and not to waste any more time.  It will be 15 years from when the project was first mooted before a shovel will have been put in the ground.  The sooner we get on with the work, the better.I was not aware that a hospice was to be located on the grounds and I am pleased to hear that.  In tandem with most people, I am a huge admirer of the work of hospices.  I am glad that St. Francis Hospice is being facilitated on these grounds.Will the Minister bring a sense of urgency to this project to ensure there is no slippage between its various stages?
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I welcome what the Minister outlined.  I encourage the fast-tracking of this project as much as possible.  I also welcome the inclusion of St. Francis Hospice on the grounds.  That is worthy and we are all pleased to hear that.The Minister said that Fingal County Council will be responsible for the further allocation of space.  What he outlined is attractive and it appears to cover predominantly sporting activities and leisure facilities.  Are there any plans in terms of administrative buildings?  Will he indicate if a percentage of the grounds will be available for the development of facilities or services other than strictly sporting ones?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The list I laid before the House includes projects for phase 1.  In so far as we may move on to another phase I have asked the board to examine what might be included in future phases.  The first project is the national field sports training centre, catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey.  The indoor training centre accommodation, a sports science medical facility and an all-weather synthetic pitch comprises the rest of phase 1.Regarding Deputy Mitchell's point, we hope to receive planning permission for the entire phase in 2008.  I will do everything possible to expedite it and will keep the House informed.  I am waiting to hear from the board on what it believes should be included in the next phase.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I support Deputy Mitchell in this regard.  The project will be a great addition to sports infrastructure in Ireland.  I note the sports that will be accommodated.  I urge the Minister to ensure the pitch is the correct size for Gaelic games, not like Lansdowne Road, which was supposed to accommodate Gaelic games.  Pitches for Gaelic games are bigger than those for other sports.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	285	It was not the size of the pitch that was the problem.  I will ensure the pitches are of the required size as we develop them.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 10 and 44 together.Under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, the individual actions and measures relating to tourism promotion or development at regional level are day-to-day functions of the State tourism agencies, as is the promotion of individual product segments such as rural tourism.  The Government has taken a number of steps to support the agencies in that regard.During 2007 the Government provided a 13% increase in the tourism budget compared to 2006, bringing the allocation to €159 million, the largest ever Exchequer budget for Irish tourism.  More recently, a pre-budget estimate of almost €164 million has been announced for 2008, an increase of 3%.  I will seek additional funding in the coming weeks.The National Development Plan 2007-2013 Transforming Ireland includes the largest ever Government investment programme for the development of Irish tourism.  This tourism development programme, which provides for an €800 million Exchequer investment in tourism over the next seven years, has as one of its fundamental objectives the stimulation of regional development.  The programme includes an international marketing sub-programme, which provides €335 million to promote the island of Ireland in key international markets.  The key objective over the seven years will be to increase tourism revenue and visitor yield and to help achieve a wider regional and seasonal distribution of business.It includes a product development and infrastructure sub-programme, which provides €317 million to upgrade and supplement our tourism attractions and activities and to deliver a national conference centre in Dublin.  It also includes a training and human resource development sub-programme, which will invest €148 million in the education and training of the tourism workforce, both domestic and non-national, as well as sustaining structured educational opportunities in third level colleges and institutes of technology around the country.  It will also provide for the continuation of initiatives aimed at improving management capability and networking in SMEs and micro-enterprises at regional level.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	287	This is too broad a question to deal with in a few minutes.  A matter that is on the mind of those in the tourism industry is competitiveness.  I am conscious that Deputy Brennan is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism but he is aware this is a cross-cutting sector, involving a number of areas.  It is up to the Minister to ensure other Ministers, whose areas have an impact on tourism, deal with the issues of competitiveness, costs to hotels, tourist attractions and difficulties of access.  The Minister must bring urgency to these areas, which have an impact on tourism.  It will become more difficult in the future.There are tax matters to be considered in the budget.  The tourism strategy refers to excise duties on wine.  There may be reasons not to reduce the price of alcohol but it is a cost to which European visitors refer as expensive.  European visitors who are accustomed to wine at a lower price find it, among other things, a major cost.I urge the Minister to be conscious of the EU review of VAT rates.  At present the areas that will attract a preferential rate, lower than the standard rate of 21%, do not include food, accommodation and the hotel sector.  Those in the accommodation industry hope that this is a mistake but it is important this matter is brought to the attention of the EU.  The rate here is 13.5% but that is higher than many of our competitors, which has an impact on competitiveness.  As the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism he must be responsible for more than just the matters within his remit.  He should bring such matters to the attention of other Ministers.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The Deputy underlines the importance of the tourism industry, with almost 240,000 workers.  If one takes a broad definition of hospitality it is arguably the largest employer in the State.  It faces many challenges, including energy costs and wages.  I have had many meetings with members of the industry.  Remaining competitive is a major challenge for an industry of that size.A new challenge is that more than one third of workers are non-national.  The challenge is to ensure we have mature integration policies, particularly in tourism, which depends substantially on the work of those who come to stay with us as employees or tourists.I share the Deputy's excitement about the industry, which has cost challenges and must try to win an increased share of the market.  We must remember that tourists do not have to come to Ireland.  The tourism industry is extremely competitive and people can travel to a myriad of places on family or business trips.  Ireland must remain competitive and attractive.  We must market what we have to offer.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Fáilte Ireland took a decision to deregulate the self-catering industry.  This is the only part of the industry that is not regulated.  I suspect it will not be promoted by Fáilte Ireland, leaving that sector in freefall.  This should be addressed.  The Minister may state that this matter should be referred to Fáilte Ireland but it will have a negative effect on rural Ireland, where the self-catering industry represents a significant part of the industry.  Will investment be made in weaker areas?  Agriculture was the mainstay of rural Ireland and agri-tourism will be very important.  Many of these areas have little tradition or expertise in developing tourism.It is extremely important, given the changing scene in rural Ireland, that those areas are supported and promoted more effectively.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	290	On the issue of self-catering, I am aware that Fáilte Ireland took the decision to which the Deputy referred but then discussions took place between the self-catering organisations and Fáilte Ireland.  I am not sure if the decision has been implemented as yet but I will check and revert to the Deputy.  I am aware that the parties entered into a round of discussions as to how they might compromise but I do not know the final outcome of those discussions.With regard to the other areas mentioned by the Deputy, there are special budgets in Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for developing specialised areas like agri-tourism, environmental tourism, sports tourism, arts tourism and so forth.  Agri-tourism is among a range of specialised areas that must be promoted.  I will ensure that Fáilte Ireland and other agencies continue to invest strongly in products such as agri-tourism.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.The Arts Council has presented me with a copy of the report and I have studied its contents.  As this report has not yet been published it would be inappropriate to comment on its recommendations at this stage.In advance of my considering the proposals further and discussing them with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and with the Arts Council, it would be premature of me to comment further.   The report will also have to be considered in the context of the 2008 Estimates and beyond.  Those Estimates are currently being discussed with the Minister for Finance.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I understood that the report was to be published in May 2007 and hoped information would be available by now on the outcome.  With regard to arts in education in general, like many other aspects of the economy, those schools in disadvantaged areas are least likely to have the supports needed to promote the arts within the school.  The Minister referred earlier to the therapeutic value of sport and I am sure he would agree that the therapeutic value of art for many children is extremely important.  Art also provides children with an additional skill.  In more advantaged areas parents are often able to provide the necessary backup and financial resources for arts education.  It is extremely important that there is a positive outcome on foot of the report and that it should be directed specifically towards disadvantaged schools, where often arts education is delivered in a very ad hoc manner.  In some schools there is a teacher who is very committed and enthusiastic and has time to devote to the arts.  In others the capacity will simply not exist.  In that context, arts education must be underpinned by a financial commitment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I wish to thank the members of the arts in education committee who worked hard to present this report to the Arts Council and then to the Department.  We have not yet completed our examination of the report but some of the recommendations must be discussed with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council before we would be in a position to publish the report.  Some issues are a little unclear and must be discussed further.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I wish to reiterate what Deputy Upton said.  Many people have made representations to me concerning the report and are anxious that something positive should emerge.  This is an enormously exciting area.  Improving access and bringing  arts in education to the whole country and all levels of society is very important.  Every child should be exposed to the arts.  I have had some experience of the artists in residence and writers in residence programmes, which are enormously beneficial and extremely popular in schools.  I hope the necessary funding will be provided and a conclusion on the report reached as quickly as possible.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

Broughan — to address the decision of the Health Service Executive to withdraw funding for new bed facilities at the Hamilton Park Nursing Home in Balrothery, Balbriggan; (4) Deputy Bernard J. Durkan — the need for intervention to alleviate the hardship and distress caused to recipients of rent support throughout north Kildare; (5) Deputy Tom Hayes — to confirm when the Abbey school will receive its long awaited funding for a PE hall; (6) Deputy Terence Flanagan — the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to appoint an inspector from his Department to assess the health and safety concerns of residents of Carndonagh Road, Donaghmede and all local residents in relation to the operations carried out by Barnmore Demolition in the Baldoyle Industrial Estate.  Previous communications from both myself and local residents with both Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council have been ignored.  I now ask the Minister to intervene, take charge and appoint an independent official from the Department to deal with this urgent health issue; and (7) Deputy Thomas Byrne — the need for further regulation of the system of solicitors' undertakings in respect of mortgage lending.The matters raised by Deputies Thomas Broughan, Bernard Durkan, Mary Alexandra White and Thomas Byrne have been selected for discussion.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	296	This matter relates to a constituent of mine who had not been able to secure a nursing home place at Hamilton Park Nursing Home, Balrothery, because of the cutbacks which the Government introduced a few months ago with regard to this year's HSE budget.  This constituent was very badly affected by the arbitrary cutbacks in health funding.  The individual in question suffered a severe stroke and had been recuperating at the Dún Laoghaire National Rehabilitation Hospital, following six months in Beaumont Hospital.  After several months of effort by his family to ensure his transfer to a more appropriate treatment centre, they were told that an application to move to Hamilton Park, Balrothery, would have to be submitted again.I was informed of the matter on 3 October and immediately tried to raise it in this House, on the Order of Business, with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children and also with Professor Drumm of the HSE.  I pay tribute to the family concerned who unfortunately had to use every available media opportunity to highlight the issue.  I pay tribute, in particular, to Mr. Joe Duffy who, on his "Liveline" programme, pursued this matter very vigorously and, in this case, successfully.The family was informed on 17 September that the patient would be transferred to Hamilton Park Nursing Home in Balrothery.  However, that date came and went without a decision on the transfer and the patient's rehabilitation treatment was reduced to below three hours per week.  Early in October the HSE informed the family that funding for all nursing homes had been withdrawn.  The family are grateful to Deputy Cyprian Brady, who took an interest in the matter.Yesterday the family informed me that my constituent will be moving to Hamilton Park today.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to raise the issue because many other families have had similar problems regarding Hamilton Park, other nursing homes and the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  Another constituent in north county Dublin suffered a cerebral abscess and was admitted to Beaumont Hospital last February.  This patient was also due to move to Hamilton Park last week but her partner contacted me a few days ago and outlined the great difficulties he and his family are enduring, attempting to care for this young mother who urgently needs a therapeutic programme at the Balrothery facility.The failure to ensure that the HSE had adequate funding to develop Hamilton Park for the two patients to whom I refer has led to other blockages in the health system.  As the Minister will be aware from media reports, at least six patients urgently waiting to be admitted to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire could not be facilitated because home care and nursing home packages were not being made available at locations like Hamilton Park.My party has studied the pre-budget statement on health and believes that a 3% to 7% increase in expenditure next year may not be sufficient to allow home care and nursing home packages to be provided for patients such as those to whom I have referred.  There are many other problems in the health system.  I know of HSE staff due to return from career breaks who cannot resume work because of the current crisis.  I am anxious to know if the Minister for Finance will introduce a package in December.  He must use whatever budgetary system is necessary to ensure that the kinds of facilities required are provided to our constituents.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I am pleased to deal with this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The Health Service Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that the person referred to by the Deputy has transferred today, as the Deputy said, from the National Rehabilitation Hospital to the Hamilton Park Care Facility at Balrothery, Balbriggan.In the context of its work to provide services within the budget voted by Dáil Éireann for 2007, the Health Service Executive is working closely with the National Rehabilitation Hospital to identify options to allow further discharges to take place as required.  The executive is aware of 31 patients who are due for discharge from the hospital before the year ends.   The HSE and the hospital are finalising solutions to discharge 13 patients from the hospital to the community.  These patients will be moved as soon as arrangements can be made.  The HSE and the hospital will continue to work closely together to resolve the cases of the remaining patients whose discharge dates fall between now and the end of the year.Funding for health services has increased over the past decade, resulting in an associated expansion of a wide range of frontline services and increased activity.  This year €15 billion of public money will be spent on health and personal social services.  The Minister for Health and Children recently announced in the pre-budget Estimates that €1 billion extra revenue funding will be provided next year for the HSE to deliver public health services, an increase of 7%.  This increase for 2008 is a substantial increase by international or any other standards to maintain existing service levels.  The Minister for Finance will announce on budget day any service development funding to be provided by the Government.Most activities this year have exceeded the target levels in the HSE's service plan.  Higher activity within budget means higher productivity, which is recognised.  However, in some cases staffing and activity levels have been higher than profile and have incurred additional costs over the anticipated level for the time of year.  For that reason, the HSE is implementing a plan to come in on budget.  I must emphasise the temporary nature of the measures which the HSE has put in place to remain within its budget.  It is also important to emphasise that the HSE has a legal responsibility to manage its funding as voted by Dáil Éireann.The National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is a 120-bed hospital which provides treatment and rehabilitation for patients with spinal cord injuries, head injuries, amputation, traumatic and non-traumatic brain injury, strokes, neurological disorders, children's disabilities and spina bifida.  It also provides wheelchair and mobility aids assessment, pre-vocational and vocational training programmes involving a wide range of social, personal and work related skills with a view to enhancing opportunities for each individual for further training, employment and educational options.  There is also a 12-bed hostel to enable clients from outside the greater Dublin area to access day services in the hospital and vocational training unit.  A new hospital is in the planning stage for the National Rehabilitation Hospital and once built will have an additional 100 beds.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	298	This matter has come to my attention recently as rents in the Kildare North constituency have increased by €200 per month.  These increases have left recipients of rent supplement in a difficult situation because the HSE has refused to increase supports in line with increases.  I realise that neither the HSE nor the Department can be seen to subsidise landlords.  However, people in receipt of rent support, based on the guidelines already laid down, have two options.  They can either leave their accommodation and sleep in the open air or receive support from family or friends.  I have several constituents who are sleeping in the open air.  This may work well while the weather is mild but when it becomes less mild, it could lead to dangerous situations for these individuals.Will the HSE and the Department of Social and Family Affairs identify the increases necessary to ensure those in receipt of rent supplements can continue in their accommodation?  While negotiations on such a process cannot leave it open-ended, it should be urgently addressed.  I know the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is a caring person and is conscious of these matters.  I ask that he address this issue without delay.  Every Member will have received calls in recent times regarding this matter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú.  Gabhaim leithscéal mar nach bhfuil an tAire Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh i láthair, ach d'iarr sé orm an freagra seo a thabairt ar a shon.The purpose of rent supplement is to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  These rent limits, provided for in regulations, are set at levels that enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.Setting maximum rent limits higher than justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodationon, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.  Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the HSE may in certain circumstances exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example in cases where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case; where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances, such as disabled persons in specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons; or where the tenant will be in a position to reassume responsibility for his or her rent within a short period.  This discretionary power ensures individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.In January 2007 the Department of Social and Family Affairs completed a review of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive a rent supplement.  The purpose of the review process was to ensure the new rent limits applicable from January 2007 reflect realistic market conditions throughout the State.  It also was to ensure they would continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.  The existing limits are applicable from January 2007 until 30 June 2008.  The review involved a broad consultation process and included consultation with the HSE, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.There are over 58,700 rent supplements in payment, of which 23,819 have been awarded since the current rent limits were set in January 2007.  There are 2,263 rent supplements in payment in County Kildare, of which 831 were awarded since January 2007.  These statistics show the rented accommodation is available within the current rent limits in County Kildare and elsewhere.  All limits will be reviewed again next year.  Any revision found to be necessary will be implemented from 1 July 2008.If Deputy Durkan has particular cases in mind, it is recommended that those concerned should approach their local community welfare officer to discuss the circumstances of their case having regard to their particular accommodation needs.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I wish to raise the results of an European Parliament Petitions Committee on the problem of ill thrift, stunted growth and low milk yields on a farm in north County Kilkenny.  The case has come to national prominence and it has repercussions for agriculture.In 1990, shortly after a local factory changed ownership, Mr. Dan Brennan, who owns a mixed-farming farm in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, began noticing problems with animals and the environment on his farm.  In what veterinary experts refer to as lack of thrive, animal growth was retarded and stunted and milk yields were low.  Trees and hedgerows showed shrivelled branches and dead leaves.In the spring of 1991, Mr. Brennan was unable to sell his animals on account of lack of growth.  Despite the absence of sickness among them, and the feeding of supplements such as cobalt, zinc, copper and all the standard vaccinations one would expect, the situation did not improve through the mid-1990s.  By 1995, Mr. Brennan noticed that heifers, typically bought in at 360 or 370 kg that should weigh 500 kg six months later had gained a mere 30 or 40 kg in weight.  It was thought that water supply was the source of the ill thrift, but a change in the farm's water source yielded no change.In 2000 the animals were put on 50 acres of rented ground on a nearby farm.  There, Mr. Brennan's veterinarians observed the animals began to look completely different.  When they were brought back to the sheds on his own farm that winter they began to lose weight again.  Laboratory tests done in Kilkenny confirmed this.In the winter of 2003-04 feeding trials were conducted on the farm.  Two sources of silage — one from Mr. Brennan's farm and one external source — were used for the trials on both Mr. Brennan's and an external herd, and yet intermittent weight loss was recorded among the animals using either silage feed.  Department officials told Mr. Brennan he had conducted the tests incorrectly.  The Department officials subsequently ran tests the following winter.  Mr. Brennan's cattle and an external sample were concurrently tested on two separate sites, being fed the exact same feed by the same, independent personnel for four months.  During the four months of feeding on his farm weight loss was recorded, but the same did not occur among the animals off site.  Despite the implications of these tests — that the weight loss was occurring because of environment rather than feed or herd — the Department failed to act on this.  A year later, in 2006, departmental veterinary officers issued a report stating that the source of his animals' problems was disease management by Mr. Brennan.In October 2006 the Department veterinary officers ceased to conduct tests on Mr. Brennan's farm.  A team of veterinarians from UCD then commenced tests.  When feeding trials in the winter of 2006-07 were conducted, it was noticed that the animals were gaining weight.  The local factory, however, whose emissions fall into the area of Mr. Brennan's farm, was closed during the course of these trials.  Two letters from Teagasc in the past two years have stated it does not believe it is the practices on Mr. Brennan's farm which have caused ill thrift and that there is some other cause.Dr. Robert Milikan, an American  veterinarian from the UCD epidemiology unit, has agreed with this statement.  Upon Dr. Milikan's recommendation, Mr. Brennan and his family were promised by the Department and by the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, in July and October 2006, that when a downturn in cattle occurred again, post mortems, liver biopsies and digestibility studies would be carried out.  A downturn happened in July 2007 and despite twice meeting the Department's deputy chief veterinary officer, none of this work has been carried out.  Despite the recent report of the European Parliament Petitions Committee into its investigations into the ill thrift of Mr. Brennan's cattle, which stated that a probable causal link exists between toxic emissions from local industry and ill effects on the livestock, trees and hedgerows on his farm, there has still been no action from the Department.  After years of injustice, Mr. Brennan is still getting the cold shoulder.I should like to know what the Department and the  Minister are going to do on the matter.  This issue is not only of importance to Irish farming but is of immense interest from a wider European and environmental perspective.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús báire, mo bhuíochas a ghabháil do mo comhghleacaí agus mo chara, Deputy White, as an gceist thábhactach seo a ardú, mar thug mé cuairt ar an bhfeirm mé féin tamall ó shin.  I therefore appreciate the difficulties being experienced by the farmer and his family.My Department and other relevant agencies have already invested considerable resources in terms of personnel and laboratory analysis, and continue to do so in an effort to get to the cause of the problem.  The animal health problems on the farm have been ongoing for a number of years and relate mainly to ill thrift and stunted growth of cattle on the farm as well as severe milk yield loss in the dairy herd.  The farm has been the subject of extensive reviews over the years and is currently the subject of further investigations being carried out by the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis, CVERA, based at UCD and funded by the Department.It had been suggested that one of the likely causes of the problems being experienced on this farm was possible exposure of animals to fluorine being emitted from a nearby brick factory.  For this reason, there has been a high degree of inter-agency involvement and co-operation in the investigations.  The agencies involved have included the Environmental Protection Agency, Kilkenny County Council, Teagasc, the South Eastern Health Board and my Department.  In 2004, the Department's veterinary laboratory service arranged for a wide-ranging study to be undertaken into the problems on the farm, following which a number of reports were produced in June 2006.  These reports documented the range of the investigations, the methodology involved and the results of different aspects.In broad terms, the reports concluded that while there were undoubtedly animal problems on the farm, the investigations had not established that the environmental impact of emissions from the factory, particularly fluoride, was sufficient to cause significant pollution or the animal health problems on the farm.  The farmer involved had certain difficulties with some aspects of one of the reports in particular, and while not disagreeing with its factual and technical aspects, he did not accept its interpretation and emphasis.  My officials recently met with him and his private veterinary practitioners to discuss the draft report and it is expected to have the report finalised shortly.Apart from the foregoing, my Department and others have been involved in a number of other initiatives on this farm.  For example, a herd health programme was developed by the farmer's private veterinary practitioners and supported by my Department to deal with respiratory disease in calves and mastitis in cows.  The Department also funded treatment for mastitis, a vaccination programme, the provision of calf hutches to segregate the calves from each other and feeding trials.  Other areas included developing a grassland management plan, monitoring growth of calves at grass, checking sources of water to the farm, monitoring blood for clinical pathology parameters and specific elements as appropriate, as well as animal disease monitoring back-up.Following finalisation of these reports in 2006, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, met a delegation of interests which included the farmer in July 2006 and confirmed that the authorities were more than willing to continue to seek to get to the root of the problems.  She also met with the director of the EPA to discuss a report it had produced on the environmental impact of emissions, particularly fluoride, associated with the brick factory.  Arising from this, in 2006 the Minister commissioned the CVERA, based at UCD, to conduct a further thorough and comprehensive study.  The CVERA study is designed to complement the work done to date and will use some different approaches to investigate the production problems on the farm.  This study entails a major sampling and testing programme as well as epidemiological studies that are seeking to establish a pattern in time and space and investigations into the competency of different metabolic pathways.  In addition, a comprehensive and detailed soil survey is included in the remit of the study.  This CVERA investigation, which commenced in late 2006, is ongoing and has the full support of the farmer.As referred to by the Deputy, the Petitions Committee of the European Parliament visited Ireland earlier this year and dealt with a complaint from the farmer in question.  To my knowledge, this committee does not have any particular scientific expertise but its report nevertheless contained certain important findings.  We do not necessarily accept that many of these are supported by the findings to date from the studies by the various agencies.  In particular we reject any assertion that we have been remiss in our investigations, given their extensive nature, as I have outlined. During the visit, the Department's deputy chief veterinary officer and the relevant agencies met with the delegation and briefed it on developments to date with regard to investigations both current and past, but these are not fully reflected in the committee's report.I would emphasise that both I and my Department as well as the other agencies involved are determined to continue to seek to establish the underlying cause of the problems on this farm.  This can best be done by further scientific investigations.  In my view, the CVERA investigation currently being undertaken is both scientific and robust, as well as being thorough and comprehensive in the areas being examined.  It would be inappropriate to speculate on its outcome until such time as the wide range of tests has been completed, the results collated and analysed and any firm scientific conclusions drawn.  I am hopeful, however, that when this report is finalised in the next few months it will shed further light on the issues involved.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I am not here to comment on any particular case before the courts as regards solicitors' undertakings and what essentially are allegations of fraud, particularly by solicitors who are namesakes of mine.  What is being heard on a daily basis is devastating for the solicitors' profession and public confidence.  I have often said that the genuine and rare mistakes of solicitors could be accepted provided the solicitor concerned was honest and confidential.  After all, that is why there is professional indemnity insurance.   When honesty is in doubt, however, the solicitor has no function in the community.  The vast majority of solicitors provide a fantastic service to clients.  Often one finds that successive generations of a family will have used the services of successive generations of a family solicitor.  The connections are both personal and professional.Turning to the issue in hand, the system of solicitors' undertakings has to be reviewed in terms of how it currently operates.  As matters stand, the banks presumably are worried about it and I trust the Law Society has concerns too.  The system of solicitors' undertakings for mortgage lending is a great but relatively recent innovation, as it eliminates the need for a mortgaging bank to have its solicitor acting for it when a borrower is obtaining mortgage facilities in respective of residential lending.  Instead, the borrower's solicitor solemnly and personally undertakes to do everything necessary to protect the bank's interest in the mortgage transaction, particularly as regards registering the borrower as the owner of the property and the bank as having the first legal charge on it.  The upshot for the borrower was that the cost of the bank's solicitor were eliminated, thereby reducing his or her liability substantially.  Residential property transactions could proceed much more smoothly.   It is often forgotten that undertakings are personal to solicitors and the solicitor is personally liable for everything he or she undertakes to the bank.  This is a significant burden on solicitors, particularly given rising property values.  However, the system of solicitors' undertakings was never intended to apply to commercial property transactions.From my experience as a solicitor and media reports, I understand the system of undertakings thrives in the commercial property lending sector.  For what might be massive transactions, many banks accept solicitors' undertakings to stamp and register the interests of borrower and bank without employing their own legal team.  The solicitor in this case has no solicitor-client duty to the bank.  This is often misunderstood and has implications in the current crisis because it means banks should have no recourse to the compensation fund of the Law Society which is for clients only.  I hope this is the view of the society because banks should not be compensated for reckless lending.In many cases, the process of undertaking in respect of a commercial mortgage is extraordinarily simple.  In my direct experience, a borrower could obtain approval for millions of euro in respect of a commercial property and the money would be issued immediately on the bank's receipt from the solicitor of a simple, one-page undertaking signed by the borrower's solicitor.  This would be an undertaking to stamp and register the deeds to the mortgaged property.  However, the system is totally dependent on the borrower's solicitor.   If there is a mistake, the bank will hope there is adequate professional indemnity cover.  This may often not be the case in commercial property transactions in the light of their generally high value, despite recent welcome increases in cover required by solicitors.  If there is dishonesty, as we have seen, all bets are off.Of the major banks of which I am aware, one branch attempted to withdraw the facility of solicitors' undertakings in commercial transactions.  However, when the bank's customers started to complain about the added costs of the bank's solicitor which they are required to bear, the branch simply dropped the requirement and returned to relying on the borrowers' solicitors' undertakings.What has really come to light in the media recently is the scandal of solicitors giving undertakings regarding their own borrowings on properties they are buying themselves.  It is completely crazy for banks to be lending money on the undertakings of their own borrowers to register the banks' interests.  In this case, the banks have only themselves to blame but the implications are very wide.I know of a minor case in which a solicitor, when buying his family home, asked the bank specifically whether it would be acceptable to give his own undertaking on his borrowings.  The bank stated this would be fine as long as he asked another solicitor to witness his signature on the mortgage deed.  Happily, I was in the position to oblige my colleague but we were both aware of the absurdity of the bank's position.From my experience, generally as a country solicitor, I have found that worry about title deeds keeps a lot of clients awake at night.  Fears are generally unjustified and often based on conjecture and worry instilled by third parties with a lack of knowledge.  However, there are many clients of certain solicitors awake at night owing to justifiable fears about the title deeds to their property and their ownership of it for which they paid and are still paying.The vast majority of solicitors, 99.9%, are devastated by recent events, but we must learn from experience.  I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to initiate discussions with the Law Society to review the system of undertakings in lending transactions and particularly to bring to an end the system of undertakings as used in commercial property lending transactions which was never intended to be used in these cases and which, ultimately, is the root cause of the current crisis.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I congratulate Deputy Thomas Byrne on becoming a father recently and wish him, his wife and new daughter Sinéad every success, health and happiness.Ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil mar ní féidir leis an Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athchóirithe Dlí bheith i láthair.  D'iarr sé orm an freagra seo a thabhairt don Teachta ar a shon.I stress, as did Deputy Byrne, that I cannot comment on individual cases, especially because the issues raised are linked to a matter before the courts.  As the Deputy is no doubt well aware, undertakings are a vital component of conveyancing practice and, in preparing for the completion of a conveyance, it is common for solicitors to give undertakings in relation to certain aspects of the process.Undertakings may take different forms, depending on who is making them and the subject of the undertaking.  For example, a vendor's solicitor may, where a property is being sold subject to a mortgage and the mortgage is to be discharged from the proceeds of the sale, give an undertaking to hold the title deeds on trust or on behalf of the mortgagee and to account to the mortgagee for the amount required to discharge the mortgage on completion of the sale.  A purchasers' solicitor will usually give an undertaking to a financial institution to the effect that he or she will ensure the purchaser has a good marketable title to the property, that the documents are executed and that all the title deeds are stamped, registered and lodged with the institution.  In addition, the solicitor will generally, pending lodgement of the title deeds with the bank or building society, undertake to hold the deeds in trust for the lending institution.It is important to understand what in particular constitutes a solicitor's undertaking as distinct from any other type of undertaking.  Essentially, the undertaking by a solicitor is a promise or guarantee given by the solicitor in his or her professional capacity to do or undertake to do certain things.  As the undertaking is given in the solicitor's professional capacity, it must be honoured by the solicitor.  Where a solicitor fails to honour an undertaking, it is considered to be professional misconduct and, as a result, he or she is rendered liable to the Law Society's disciplinary procedures and investigation by the solicitors disciplinary tribunal which is independent of the society.  It is appointed by the President of the High Court and includes lay members.The tribunal has limited judicial powers and its primary function is to establish, by evidence and documents, the facts of a complaint and decide whether misconduct is proved.  Where there is a finding of misconduct, the tribunal can impose a sanction on the solicitor which can include a direction to pay restitution to an aggrieved party, or it may refer its finding and recommendation to the President of the High Court who will ultimately decide on the nature of the sanction to be imposed on the solicitor.  This can include the striking of the solicitor off the roll.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is further strengthening these powers in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 by providing for the better enforcement of orders made by the tribunal.It should also be noted that, as an officer of the court, the solicitor is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and may be compelled by it to implement the undertaking.  Furthermore, it is possible, depending on the facts of the case and the wording of the undertaking, that the court may enforce the undertaking against the solicitor personally.Given the nature of an undertaking, it is imperative that great care is exercised by a solicitor where the question of giving an undertaking is concerned.  The Law Society has issued guidelines to its practitioner members on the giving of undertakings.   A number of principles relating to undertakings have been outlined by the society regarding issues such as obtaining an irrevocable authority from a client to give such an undertaking and the inadvisability of giving personal undertakings, unless the solicitor is in a position to honour the undertaking.The Law Society has also agreed standard forms of undertakings with the Irish Banking Federation to cover a number of issues such as the lending of title documents to a solicitor for inspection only and return to the institution.  In so far as the system of banking and making loans available to clients is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no function.The Financial Regulator is responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish-licensed financial institutions and independent in matters of day-to-day supervision.  The regulator has consistently conveyed to lending institutions that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible.  The standards accord with best regulatory practice internationally.  According to the IMF, our regulatory regime is up to the best international standards.  It is in everybody's interests that best practice is followed in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  In so far as there are any matters to be reviewed or issues addressed, he can be assured that the responsible Ministers will do so.

The ACCESS scheme is designed to assist the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructure, thereby enhancing access to the arts throughout the country, including the border region.ACCESS has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of high quality arts and culture infrastructure around the country.  It is expected that ACCESS II will also result in the creation of direct and indirect employment in the arts and in the local economies.A total of 155 applications were received under the scheme. Funding of the order of €200 million was sought.  As only €32m was available for disbursal, hard decisions had to be made and many worthy projects, including this one, were not offered funding.  Nevertheless, a total of 67 projects in all (including two in Monaghan) were offered funding in this round.All unsuccessful applications have been retained on file and will be re-considered should additional funding become available. The project promoters in question have also been advised by representatives from my Department to forward any additional information, which may assist that consideration process. I understand that my officials will be meeting the promoters shortly to discuss the project.I have no statutory role in relation to funding stemming from the St. Andrews Agreement, but I can ensure the Deputy that any application for capital arts funding received by my Department will receive fair consideration and will be evaluated on its merits.

Both scholarship programmes are of five year duration, and were put in place to honour the memory of two seminal figures in the Irish literary and arts philanthropy world.  The details are as follows: The Beckett Scholarship for Drama, in the Drama School at Dublin University, Trinity College.The scholarship was put in place as part of the celebrations of the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Samuel Beckett, Beckett 100, and will run for five years with a grant of €5,000 per annum from my Department. The scholarship is awarded by Trinity College, which also provides 50% of the funding. The scholarship is awarded after an open, transparent process confined to students in TCD, Beckett's alma mater.  The beneficiary in 2006/7 was Nicholas Johnson. The beneficiary in 2007/8 is Jackie Blackman.The Lewis Glucksman Fellowship, University College Cork and New York University.Under the fellowship, each year a student of History from University College Cork will receive a scholarship at Doctorate level and spend 12 months in New York University and a New York University student of International Contemporary Art will study for 12 months at University College Cork.  The €50,000 per annum grant from my Department is half of the total cost of the two fellowships. The Fellowship programme will run for five years and will be subject to ongoing review. The first fellowship will be in 2007/8 academic year and the UCC beneficiary is David Fitzgerald, a PhD student. The fellowship programme was put in place to honour in a tangible and enduring way the seminal contribution of Lewis Glucksman to the Arts in this his adopted country.There are no sports scholarships available from my Department but I understand that a number of our 3rd level institutions have such scholarships schemes in place.

I fully understand and appreciate the concerns of the arts sector and indeed the huge impact this has on the not-for-profit arts sector.I intend to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance in the context of the 2008 Finance Bill and I will update him on the impact on the not-for-profit arts sector of this legislation. However, it is important to note that I have no statutory function in relation to VAT and ultimately changes to VAT legislation are a matter for the Minister for Finance.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.All applications received under the programme are assessed by my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions that accompany the application form for the programme.  The assessment process also takes into account factors such as the existing level of facilities in an area, the number and quality of the applications received, the amount of funding being sought by each applicant and the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required as well as the most recent Census of Population figures.  Every effort is made to achieve a balanced geographical spread of funds throughout the country, while also affording priority to projects in areas of social and economic disadvantage.Over €63 million in sports capital funding has been allocated to border counties between 1998 and 2007 inclusive.  The breakdown of these allocations on a county basis is:CountyCapital Funding 1998-2007€Cavan7,574,261Donegal27,697,895Monaghan8,663,676Louth14,097,635Leitrim5,299,298Total63,332,785Furthermore, it should be noted that these figures represent an average allocation per head, based on 2002 census figures, of more than 16% above the national average during that period.I would also inform the Deputy that in regard to applications received under the 2007 programme, an average of 87.7% of valid applications from these five counties were funded.In regard to current funding for sport in the border counties, funding for the development and promotion of sport is provided through the Irish Sports Council (ISC), the statutory agency established in 1999.  The ISC's primary source of support for the regions is through the Local Sports Partnership (LSP) network.  At present, there are LSPs in two of the border counties — Donegal and Monaghan.  To date, Donegal has received €1,127,822 in ISC funding in respect of the period from 2001 to 2007 and Monaghan has received €193,037 in respect of the period 2004 –2007. The process of establishing LSPs in the other border counties is well underway and the national LSP network should be in place in the first half of 2008.  Funding to the newer LSPs will then be allocated as part of the annual LSP grant process.

Decisions to site a film project in a particular territory involve complex funding (the unfavourable exchange rate continues to affect the level of US production in Ireland), cultural, logistical and project-specific elements, all of which are crucial for a successful result.Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board. This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.My Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of the Section 481 tax relief scheme. The scheme is kept under review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any necessary amendments to retain or regain competitiveness will be addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate. In that regard, the Department of Finance in conjunction with my Department is currently finalising a review of the case for improvement in respect of the Section 481 scheme. Consultants have been appointed by the Department of Finance and it is envisaged that their report will identify a structured way forward to develop and consolidate the Irish film industry, taking account of the serious international competition issues now apparent. The report is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.I believe that the industry in Ireland has never been stronger in terms of international acclaim.  This is evidenced by the Palme d'Or for the "Wind that Shakes the Barley," the Cannes award in 2007 for "Garage", the Oscar for "Six Shooter", the Sundance award for "Once" and two Emmys for "The Tudors".  Our challenge is to build on those successes and the Film Board and I are committed to doing that.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Under the sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, grants are allocated to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.One of the stated aims and objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2002, it was decided that only those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CLAR areas should be treated as disadvantaged under the programme.Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications. They are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available (20% as against the normal 30%) towards their project, and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process under the level of socio-economic disadvantage criterion.Successful projects under the Sports Capital Programme in CLAR and RAPID areas may qualify to receive top-up funding, payable by the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in addition to their sports capital allocation.  In the case of projects located in CLAR areas, this top-up funding can be up to 20% of the sports capital grant amount; in the case of projects located in RAPID areas which are also endorsed by their local Area Implementation Team, the top-up funding can be up to 30%.The 2007 Sports Capital Programme was advertised in the national press in October 2006.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was 24th November 2006.  Over 1,530 applications were received for the programme and provisional allocations totalling €85 million were made to 935 projects on 5th April last.For the Deputy's information, grants totalling €38,679,550 were allocated to 455 projects in disadvantaged areas.  To date, my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has announced top-ups for qualifying grantees of €6,412,510.Finally, in relation to funding for schools, I should point out to the Deputy that applications to the programme from primary and post-primary schools and colleges must be made jointly with local sports clubs or community groups and must as a minimum demonstrate that the local community will have significant access to the proposed facility when it is not being used by the school or college itself.  In this regard, the minimum requirement is at least 30 hours a week throughout the year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 48 together.The position, as stated in my reply of 5th July 2007 to Parliamentary Question No.18, is that the redeveloped Concert Hall will incorporate a main auditorium with a seating capacity for 2,000 patrons, the existing auditorium, which will be retained as a rehearsal hall and a mid-scale public performance space, and a smaller flexible hall.  This three-hall configuration will enable the National Concert Hall to provide for public demand including the staging of key performances by top-class world artistes at reasonable ticket prices. The redeveloped Concert Hall will meet the requirement for universal access.  Furthermore, the proposal incorporates easy access for large articulated trucks transporting orchestral and concert equipment.  It is envisaged that the Earlsfort Terrace buildings would be re-united with the Iveagh Gardens, facilitating increased public access.  New public rooms, cafes and restaurants would over-look the Gardens and the city.  The new facility, when constructed, will enable the National Concert Hall to provide for public demand including the staging of key performances by top-class world artistes at reasonable ticket prices.The project is overseen by an Interagency Steering Committee. The task of this committee is to oversee the procurement, negotiation and construction phases of the design/build/finance and maintain PPP for the redevelopment of the Hall, in compliance with relevant Department of Finance Guidelines and in adherence to the terms of the Government Decisions germane to the project. The Committee is also charged with realising the vision set for the project.I am not in a position to give figures at this stage as to the total cost. The actual total cost associated with the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall will depend on the terms of the contract which will be placed for this PPP project. That cost will be determined as a result of the PPP competition.  Clearly in the compilation of the Public Sector Benchmark (PSB), against which all PPP bids will be assessed, an element will be built in for construction costs.  That PSB and its component parts (of which construction costs is only one) has to remain confidential, of course, to protect the integrity of the PPP competition.

Details of the tender recommended by the County Council were received in my Department in April 2007 and have been cleared by the Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works.  However, before I can approve the tender and formally allocate the maximum grant of €3.8m for the project, the local authority must ensure that the funding for the entire project is in place.  At present a shortfall in the overall funding for the project exists and my Department is in consultation with the Local Authority with a view to establishing mechanisms to address the shortfall.

While that Department has responsibility for Local Authorities who collect commercial rates, the matter raised in this question and also in the representations would appear to require a change to the Valuation Act 2001 which I understand is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have therefore sent the said representations to the Minister of Finance for his consideration.The Department of Finance have advised my officials that the situation with regard to commercial rates and sporting bodies is that in accordance with the Valuation Act 2001, sports clubs which are licensed to sell alcohol and registered under the Registration of Club (Ireland) Act, 1904 are rateably valued as licensed clubs in their entirety, which includes all the buildings in the club notwithstanding their various uses at different times.  The operation of the licence by the sports club is regarded as a commercial activity and these licensed club premises are competing with other licensed premises, all of which are rateable.The Department of Finance has further advised that there are no plans at present to amend the valuation legislation as currently applied to licensed club premises.

Typically these programmes are funded through the National Programme Against Racism (NPAR) administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Another recent development, partly supported by the Council, is the appointment by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) of an Intercultural Officer, the first such appointment to be made in the country.The Deputy will also be aware that under the Sport Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool Programmes the Department is supporting a range of sporting facilities which contribute to the greater involvement of people in sporting activities.

In 2006 the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at George's Dock on a Build, Finance and Maintain (BFM) basis. Arising from the Government decision, an Interagency Steering Committee was set up to oversee this project. The Committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, the Office of Public Works, the Abbey Theatre and the Dublin Docklands Development Agency.The Steering Group has met six times and is due to meet again on 13th December. At its first meeting in December 2006 the Committee decided, inter alia, that the Office of Public Works should prepare the documentation necessary for holding an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre.A Project Team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and representative of the same agencies as the Steering Group has also been set up and is currently overseeing the arrangements for holding the international design competition. The OPW has asked the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) to organise the competition.  The RIAI, with the assistance of the OPW and input from all key stakeholders is in the process of drafting the competition regulations. The technical documentation for the competition must be very carefully specified.A jury was appointed last week to select the winning design. The jury has representatives from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the OPW, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the Arts Council and the Abbey. It also includes international figures in the architectural and theatre worlds. It is expected that the design competition will be completed by the middle of 2008.Discussions are currently ongoing in relation to the detailed accommodation brief for the new theatre.  In the meantime, OPW are working on preliminary drafting of output specifications and liaising with the NDFA on assembling technical advisory teams, including theatre consultants and acoustic consultants, with a view to progressing the project as much as possible while the design competition is being held. The National Development Finance Agency has recently appointed legal advisers and financial advisers arising from a market exercise. A Process Auditor has also been appointed, in accordance with Department of Finance Guidelines.When a winning design has been chosen, the National Development Finance Agency will oversee the PPP procurement process, in accordance with PPP guidelines.

The Plan has been prepared in consultation with the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and my own Department.The purpose of the plan is to ensure that the region is well placed to respond to the challenges and opportunities emerging in the context of full liberalisation of the transatlantic aviation market and the phasing out of the Shannon Stop as envisaged under the EU-US Open Skies Agreement.The Tourism Agencies are acutely aware of the need to respond in a positive and proactive way to the challenges facing the region and both I and my Department have been in dialogue with them about this.In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, an appropriate tourism initiative has been formulated in the context of the development of the Plan and I expect that, subject to approval of the Plan,  fuller details will emerge closer to Budget day.

My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following:to stimulate public interest in the arts;to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;to assist in improving standards in the arts.The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased by almost 68% from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007.  These are significant amounts of money in any context and have transformed and increased access to the arts and allowed the Arts Council to support artists and arts organisations nationwide. The Government's commitment to the arts is evidenced by these large increases in funding to the Arts Council.My Department has taken a direct role in relation to the provision of grant-aid for arts and culture infrastructure and has provided substantial funding for the capital development of facilities around the country in recent years.  For example, my Department has provided over €43m to 40 arts facilities through the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme (ACCESS). Furthermore On 24th April last, funding of €32 million was offered to the promoters of 67 projects nationwide under the Arts and Culture Capital Enhancement Support Scheme II (ACCESS II 2007-2009).The ACCESS scheme is designed to assist in the provision of high standard arts and culture infrastructure, thereby enhancing access to the arts throughout the country.    ACCESS has been widely acknowledged as a significant intervention in the provision of high quality arts and culture infrastructure around the country.

The importance of the work of Culture Ireland has been recognised during its start up phase by a 50% increase each year since it was established in 2005 with an initial budget of €2m.The Government approved the establishment of Culture Ireland on a statutory basis earlier this year and my Department is currently working through the legislative process in this regard.Culture Ireland, in just over two years in existence, has achieved a great deal in the promotion and advancement of Irish arts abroad. Its support for the international presence of Irish artists and arts organisations has created new opportunities for Irish artists and has raised the awareness of Ireland as a global centre of arts, creativity and innovation. This, in turn, will lead to Ireland being recognised as a preferred destination for tourism, trade and investment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	318	On the completion of an independent assessment of certain corporate governance and doping issues affecting Bord na gCon, conducted by Mr. Tim Dalton, the Government approved a number of specific actions to be taken.   A number of the recommendations require an amendment of existing legislation and work is ongoing on the legislation to implement these recommendations.Bord na gCon is the statutory body responsible for the greyhound racing industry, including integrity management and anti-doping controls.  In relation to the establishment of an independent Doping Control Committee, it was decided that new arrangements should not be delayed until the relevant legislative changes were made and should be implemented by the Board, using its existing powers.Accordingly, an independent Control Committee and a Control Appeal Committee have been established to adjudicate on all matters concerning the integrity of greyhound racing.  The Control Committee held its first meeting on 25 July 2007 and, after allowing the appropriate period for appeals from decisions of the Committee, the findings in all cases were published in accordance with the regulations established by the Board.In cases involving serious prohibited substances, the Committee imposed substantial fines (and, in some instances, forfeiture of prize money) and believes this will act as an appropriate deterrent going forward.I am advised that under its established prohibited substance testing policy, Bord na gCon conducts random testing, targeted testing and pre- and post-race testing.  Sample analysis is conducted by the Board's National Greyhound Laboratory, which operates to the highest level of industry accreditation.  I am further advised that the laboratory is continually reviewing and improving its testing methodologies for the detection of prohibited substances.I am confident that the testing regime employed by Bord na gCon and the appointment of the independent Control and Control Appeal Committees will be effective in monitoring and controlling the use of prohibited substances.

It set out a 10 year Strategy for the tourism sector and laid down ambitious targets for the industry namely, 10 million visitors per annum and €6 billion in foreign revenue earnings by 2012.Following publication of the New Horizons Report,  a high level group — the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group —  was appointed to oversee implementation of the Strategy and its final report in 2006 highlighted that good progress had been made on over 80% of the seventy six actions recommended by the Review Group in the initial two year action plan.The progress report also pointed to a number of areas where progress had been less satisfactory, including pressure on competitiveness, the need for innovation and product development, variations in performance between urban and rural areas and the visitor experience at Dublin Airport.A new Tourism Strategy Implementation Group was appointed in 2006 to oversee the implementation of the outstanding recommendations in the New Horizons report, to review the targets in the light of performance to date, and to recommend a possible framework for a mid term review due to take place next year.The Implementation Group has met on a number of occasions and is working with the tourism industry and public sector bodies to help address a number of key areas of concern, including value for money, productivity and skills, sustainability, regional spread and product development.2006 was a record year for Irish tourism with an all time high of 7.7 million overseas visitors to the country representing a 10.5% increase on 2005. The outcome was more than double the target of 5% growth which was set for the year.  Foreign revenue earnings in 2006 were €4.7bn, an increase of almost 10% on 2005.The Tourism Strategy Implementation Group is at present preparing a progress report, outlining achievements in the sector over the past two years and initiatives underway to address ongoing challenges.  A key element in its report will be an analysis of the statistical targets set in the New Horizons report and progress toward achievement.   Work to date shows that over the period 2002 to 2006 total overseas visitor numbers have grown slightly ahead of targets, while revenue in real terms has grown at a slower rate.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Crime and measures to prevent and combat it are, as the Deputy is aware, matters for the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform and An Garda Síochána, with whom my Department liaises on a number of issues of common concern, as they arise.At the outset, I want to take this opportunity to extend, on my own behalf, on behalf of the Irish tourism sector and, I am sure, on behalf of all Members of the House, my heartfelt sympathies toward the parents, relatives and friends of this young girl (Manuela Riedo) who suffered such a tragic and senseless death.We are all aware of the impact a crime can have on a person and his or her family.  Those who are away from home, such as students and tourists, are even more vulnerable to such impacts. They are in a strange environment and their problems can be compounded by language, cultural and legal issues.However, I would ask the House to note that there is no basis for the assertion that there is a high level of crime directed against tourists in this country. In international terms Ireland is regarded as a safe destination. It may not be widely known but Ireland is seen as a ‘best practice' model in Europe in terms of the support it provides tourists in the aftermath of crime.Of course, while the overwhelming majority of our visitors do not encounter crime, I do not consider that there is any acceptable level of crime and I believe that one outrage is one too many.I am advised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a number of initiatives have been undertaken by the Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána during the last ten years in response to crime directed against tourists in Ireland.My Department also liaises with the Irish Tourist Assistance Service (ITAS), which receives funding from Fáilte Ireland as well as from the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime. ITAS offers support and assistance to tourists who may become victims of crime while visiting Ireland. The service was launched in 1994 and, since that time, has, I understand, assisted over 8,000 visitors. In contrast, we received 7.7 million visitors in 2006 alone.I can say that the effectiveness of our supports for tourists in difficulties is illustrated by the fact that96% of ITAS clients would still recommend Ireland as a holiday destination.88%, on average, elect to continue their holidays.96% said the help provided by ITAS was sufficient for their needs.While it is too early at present to assess fully the impact this tragedy may have on the EFL (English as a Foreign Language) market, I am advised that Fáilte Ireland will closely monitor the impact of the death of the Swiss student in Galway on this large and growing niche market.Based on a survey carried out by Fáilte Ireland in 2006 with the Advisory Council for English Language Schools there are over 130,000 EFL students coming to Ireland each year and the numbers are growing. A growth rate of 5.4% is expected for 2007.  The main markets remain in Europe, with Italy, Spain and France being the top three. However, it is estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 EFL students come from Switzerland each year.

I am committed to ensuring that they remain at the very heart of Government policy and central to our nation's well-being.  I am also committed to growing the Arts and Cultural communities and, in doing so, to highlight, in particular, their significant contribution to our country, culturally, socially and economically.In that context, and building on the commitments in the Programme for Government and in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, I am currently considering how best to give effect to these objectives. With this in mind I have begun a process of widespread individual consultation with organisations, groups and individuals across the spectrum in the areas of Arts and Culture. I have written to all of these inviting them to meet with me, together with senior officials in my Department, on a regular basis to seek their advice on how we can work together in advancing our ambitions for Ireland in this area.While listening carefully to what these organisations and individuals have to say on how best to progress in the future, my letter of invitation also set out a number of key themes that I wish to explore with them, including:Increasing access to, and participation in, arts, culture and creative activities:Building capacity, infrastructure and participation in the regions:Enhancing the quality and reputation of Irish creative product at home and abroad;Supporting the tourism market by bringing arts, culture and creative energies to the fore;The promotion of Irish arts, culture and creative sector practitioners world-wide.The opportunities and challenges posed by multiculturalism.Greater engagement with the business community;And ensuring adequate fiscal and other supports for the arts in all its guises.A number of meetings in this extensive consultation process have already been held and I have found them to be very helpful and insightful in identifying the challenges, opportunities, issues and concerns affecting the arts and culture sectors.  Should I feel,  when the current round of individual meetings has been completed, that extra help and advice could be of benefit, I will review the option of appointing an arts adviser.

It has been agreed with the IRFU and FAI who are jointly leading the project that they are to provide the balance of the funding.I am informed that the IRFU and FAI are providing their respective shares of the funding through utilising a number of funding strategies and these include an initiative to evaluate and ultimately market the naming rights for the new stadium.  The initiative regarding the naming rights is a matter for the sports organisations concerned which are independent, autonomous bodies responsible for the promotion and development of their sports at all levels throughout the country.

The Deputy may be thinking of the current review of Tourism Brand Ireland which is nearing completion.  Tourism Ireland is a jointly-funded North South body.  The resourcing of Tourism Ireland and its Corporate and Business Plans are subject to the agreement of the North-South Ministerial Council. There are, therefore, two Ministers for Tourism, two Ministers for Finance and the North-South Ministerial Council involved in the process.The extent to which the implementation of any recommendations, that may flow from  Tourism Ireland's Brand Review, can be implemented by Tourism Ireland will be determined by the overall level of its budget which is, of course, subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes, North and South, and also, of course, its own internal priorities.I am positively disposed to seeking such resources as may be necessary to implement relevant recommendations but the eventual Southern contribution to the Agency for next year will have to be decided within the context of the national Budgetary process.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary means of providing funding to sporting clubs, voluntary and community organisations towards the provision of sporting facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  The programme is advertised on an annual basis.  All applications received are evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.Since 2000, funding has been provided under the sports capital programme towards the improvement of the facilities at cricket's venue for hosting international matches, the Clontarf Cricket Club, and for the establishment of the national Centre of Excellence for the sport, at North County Cricket Club in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin.  Since 2000, cricket has benefited from grant aid in the amount of almost €1.3m under the sports capital programme.I have put on record my pride and delight at the outstanding performance of the Irish Cricket Team who qualified for the Super Eight stage at the Cricket World Cup in the West Indies.  This was an unprecedented achievement for the Irish Cricket Team.  I am also aware of the wish of the Irish Cricket Union to develop a new ground for cricket in Ireland.  In this regard, I understand that the Irish Cricket Union has established a committee, chaired by the President of the Union, to draw up proposals and make recommendations in relation to the establishment of this facility.  I look forward to receiving these proposals in due course.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The Advisory Group report on the Church pre-1900 Birth, Marriage and Death Records Computerisation Project was approved by my Department in August of this year.  The Report concluded with a number of recommendations and included best practice guidelines for Irish genealogical websites.The Report recommended that Irish Genealogy Limited (IGL) should operate with a revised role as, primarily, an advisory body for my Department on genealogy matters.  A revised constitution has been drafted reflecting this new role and an extraordinary general meeting of IGL is due to be held in the near future to adopt the new documents of association after which I will be appointing the new IGL Board.Arising from a recommendation in the Report that priority should be given to the computerisation of outstanding Dublin City Records, my Department has made very significant progress in partnership with Dublin City Public Libraries on the computerisation of Dublin City records.  Work is ongoing to computerise the transcribed Catholic records (i.e. those transcribed to index cards) and it is anticipated that approximately 600,000 Dublin City records will have been computerised by the end of this year.  This constitutes almost all of the transcribed records for the Dublin City parishes.  A scoping group has also been established to assess the most effective method for the computerisation of the remaining un-transcribed records.Officials from my Department have been in contact with a number of other genealogy centres, with a view to assisting them in completing the computerisation of their remaining records.  The best practice guidelines for Irish genealogical websites have been circulated to all centres seeking funding.By implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Group and in partnership with the various genealogy centres, it is hoped that significant progress will be made in making available a comprehensive set of records which can provide motivation for potential overseas visitors to visit Ireland, can enable people living in Ireland to carry out family research and can facilitate social research.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The importance of transport access to and from our major airports is clearly identified as a key element in the Government's strategies for the development of tourism.  Of course, planning and investment in transport infrastructure in a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport and the agencies under the aegis of his Department.The report of the Tourism Policy Review Group, New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, published in September 2003, set out a comprehensive tourism development strategy for a ten-year period and included a detailed and practical action plan.  Among the actions identified in the Report was the achievement of the early completion of the National Roads route network around international air and sea access points, significant upgrading of facilities and accelerating proposals for developing a metro link between Dublin airport and Dublin city centre.In 2006, the Tourism Action Plan Implementation Group, which was appointed for a period of two years to oversee implementation of the recommendations, reported that good progress had been made on the transport infrastructure actions identified in New Horizons.  In particular, the inclusion of these actions in Transport 21, the Government's medium-term investment framework for transport, was welcomed by the Implementation Group.Since then, there has been continuing progress on transport access issues.  For example, I understand that, following announcement of the selected route for Metro North from St Stephen's Green to Swords via the Airport in October 2006, the procurement process is well under way.  Construction is due to commence in 2009 and finish in 2012.I do not need to spell out in detail the very significant progress that has taken place in improving our road and rail infrastructure under the aegis of the Minister for Transport in the last few years.  This has been paralleled by the ongoing investment in non-national roads by local authorities, funded by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government — which is also very significant for regional airports.  The Government's recent decision to bring responsibility for all investment in roads under the remit of the Department of Transport will facilitate the continued delivery of this investment.In the related area of signposting, the National Roads Authority, in consultation with my Department and Fáilte Ireland, has published a "Policy on the Provision of Tourist and Leisure Signage on National Roads" which was published this year.The Tourism Strategy Implementation Group was appointed in 2006 to oversee the implementation of the outstanding recommendations in the New Horizons report, to review the targets in the light of performance to date, and to recommend a possible framework for a mid term review due to take place next year.  The Tourism Strategy Implementation Group is at present preparing a progress report, outlining achievements in the sector over the past two years and initiatives underway to address ongoing challenges.

As part of this response, we are aware that investment in sport can yield vary tangible returns in improved fitness and health for individuals, which can help combat obesity and result in a consequent reduction in the demand on health services.My Department funds the Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is the statutory body responsible for the development of sport in Ireland.  The 2007 budget for the ISC has increased by over 30% on 2006, to more than €54 million.  This continued increased level of funding ensures that the ISC can continue to embark on initiatives and programmes that increase participation in sport and physical recreation by people of all ages in the country.The Irish Sports Council's current strategy, Building Sport for Life 2006-2008, identifies increasing participation in sport as its key objective and, based on its research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, sets specific targets in this regard.Children and young people are specific target groups. There are several ISC programmes and initiatives aimed at young people, including the following:Buntus is a series of programmes aimed at giving young children the best possible start to the lifelong involvement in sport.  Operated through the Locals Sport Partnership (LSP) network, it supports the PE Curriculum in Primary Schools and has also been adapted for pre-school children and a range of sports-specific initiatives (e.g. soccer, rugby, golf, basketball and badminton).Youth Field Sports initiatives include support for the work of the GAA, FAI and the IRFU in expanding their participation base, with a particular emphasis on young people and areas of low participation.The Women in Sport scheme is a dedicated programme that supports innovative programmes with governing bodies and sports partnerships that target inactive women, with a particular emphasis on teenage girls.Various projects within the LSP network target children and young people to promote greater levels of physical activity.  Some of these projects have been supported in partnership with the Health Services Executive this year, thus recognising the need to challenge the issue of obesity through a multidisciplinary, cross-functional approach.I will continue to monitor progress in this area closely and I am confident that the programmes provided by the Irish Sports Council to increase participation, especially those programmes targeted at children and young people, will contribute significantly to combating the problem of childhood obesity in this country.

While section 14 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997 empowers the Boards of the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland to pass bye-laws imposing charges subject to my consent, permission would not be forthcoming for the imposition of charges for admission to the National Collections.The Board of the National Gallery of Ireland has passed bylaws enabling that institution to impose charges to recoup costs associated with the provision of temporary exhibitions that create additional costs for the Gallery.  In theses cases, however, admission to the National Collection remains free.  Where charges are imposed for temporary exhibitions, reduced admission charges for children, senior citizens and other appropriate groups are provided.In keeping with my commitment to increasing access to arts and culture, I will keep the issue raised by the Deputy under review.

Of this, €66,500 has been drawn down to date.  I understand that the organisation were also allocated €18,000 in top-up funding under the CLÁR programme by my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.My Department has not received any request for additional funding from the organisation in question but they are free to apply for the next round of the programme if they have a project that meets the published Guidelines, Terms and Conditions governing the programme.  As in previous years, advertisements announcing the next round of the programme will be placed in the national press and application forms will be available at that stage.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The High Level Strategy of my Department in relation to Tourism is "To support the sustainable growth of the tourism industry and to help it address the competitive challenge through the development, implementation and influencing of a range of policy actions and programmes which optimise the economic and social benefits of the sector".Under the influence of the Government's Sustainable Development Strategy, the principles of Sustainable Development are increasingly permeating public policy and programmes including those related to Tourism.  Sustainable Development incorporates the three principles mentioned by the Deputy — Social Cohesion, Economic Prosperity and Environment — or the three Ps, , as they are more popularly know — People, Profit and Place.  Each one of these applies to the Tourism sector.These principles are incorporated in the current guiding Vision for Irish Tourism which is set out in the New Horizons Report on Irish Tourism. That Vision reads as follows:Ireland will be a destination of choice for discerning international and domestic tourists which:provides a tourism experience that exceeds customer expectations in terms of friendliness, quality of environment, diversity and depth of culturehas a range of high-quality, world-class, competitive products and services widely distributed throughout all the regions of the countryis a vibrant source of foreign and regional earnings throughout the yearrespects the natural and built environments and supports their conservation and enhancementprovides attractive career opportunities in tourism for people with a range of skills and employment needsprovides the opportunity for people working in tourism to enhance their skills through experience, training and life-long learningrespects and supports Irish culture in all its diversityprovides a positive international profile of Ireland".The tourism industry has a wide geographic distribution.  In some, otherwise undeveloped areas, it is the main source of development and employment.  The Government has a strong regional tourism policy which guides the activities of the Tourism Agencies in the formulation and delivery of their programmes.  Fáilte Ireland, works closely with the sector, through its own training initiatives and the education and awareness programmes that it supports, to help improve the quality of training and also to encourage the industry to provide good conditions and career prospects to its employees.Tourism is a generator of wealth with a high indigenous component.  It is one of our major economic sectors.  The physical environment is one of the core tourism resources and the sector is becoming increasingly conscious of that.  The tourism sector is increasingly proactive in addressing sustainability issues.  The overarching challenge for the tourism sector is to remain competitive while also embracing sustainability, recognising that in the long term competitiveness depends on sustainability — including environmental sustainability.  I would note that there is no evidence from environmental surveys over the years that the Tourism sector is a significant polluter of the environment.  It is clear, however, that Tourism is a sector that will suffer from environmental damage through the undermining of Ireland's clean green image.Under its Agreed Programme, this Government is committed "to develop our tourism industry and provide it with sustained support and investment".  To this end, the Government will, among other things, place much greater emphasis on the protection, conservation, interpretation and access to Ireland's natural and built heritage.At the operational level, Fáilte Ireland has re-embraced its environmental remit with great vigour and is working with the industry, the local authorities and a wide range of partners to promote a balanced and sustainable approach to Tourism development.  I am advised that Fáilte Ireland has recently published its Environmental Action Plan for the period 2007-2009.  The Plan sets out what Fáilte Ireland will do to help meet the environmental challenges facing Tourism.Of course, ultimately, it is the tourism industry itself that must meet the challenges and seize the opportunities generated by the sustainability agenda, at sectoral and enterprise levels.  National Tourism Policy recognises that competitiveness is the number one challenge facing Irish Tourism.  Ireland is not a low-cost economy and tourism businesses are under strong cost pressures. The introduction of more efficient use of resources like energy, more recycling and better environmental management generally, provides an opportunity to significantly reduce the running costs of tourism businesses. This has been shown through initiatives such as Fáilte Ireland's Performance Plus programme and the Irish Hospitality Institute's Greening Irish Hotels scheme.In conclusion, I would also note that my Department and the tourism agencies take an active part in a wide range of groups and fora focusing on sustainability and the environment, providing the tourism input into consideration of a wide range of policies and activities.

The Report is examining, among other things, how the programme has worked to date and what changes, if any, are required to ensure its effective and efficient delivery.  The grant level for swimming pools is also examined in the report.Thereafter, following consideration of the recommendations in the Report, it is my intention to launch a new round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  There is a provision of  €184m in the National Development Plan, 2007-2013 in respect of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.

Under the public private partnership arrangement, Spencer Dock Convention Centre Dublin Ltd, is required to design, build and finance the National Conference Centre and to operate and maintain it for a period of 25 years, after which the facility will revert to the State.  In return, once the construction of the Centre is complete and it is open for business, the State will pay the Company an annual charge, the maximum total cost of which over 25 years will be just under €380m in present day values.

A fully owned subsidiary of the Authority, NSCDA (Operations) Ltd., is now operating the National Aquatic Centre.  A full "health check" has been carried out on the National Aquatic Centre since it came back into the possession of CSID on 1 December 2006.  The necessary repair works to restore the Centre to its original working standard have been ongoing since then and have been taking place in conjunction with the overall "health check".  To date approximately €600,000 has been expended on remediation work.I am sure Deputies will agree with me that this is a wonderful facility which has been through and survived a difficult time over the past few years. I would invite Deputies to come and see the Centre for themselves and I look forward to their support for this key piece of our sporting infrastructure.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	336	In my reply to PQ 19344/07 on 5 July last, I outlined my priorities for the development and promotion of sport, which are set out in the Programme for Government.  I am currently in the process of formulating policies and objectives, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to achieve the delivery of these priorities, which will be articulated further in my Department's new Statement of Strategy 2008-2010 which is in preparation and which is to be completed by the end of 2007.I see the overriding objectives that will drive the development of policy to be the achievement of greater accessibility and participation for all in the area of sport.  Under the provisions of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, a total of some €911m has been earmarked for programmes such as the Sports Capital and Local Authority Swimming Pool programmes and such major capital projects as the new Lansdowne Road stadium and the Abbotstown Campus project.One of the major issues to be addressed in future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme is the introduction of a more strategic targeted approach to the funding of projects.  The development of a National Sports Strategy by my Department will provide high-level policy direction for future investment/grant assistance at national, regional and local level.Since the establishment of the statutory Irish Sports Council in 1999, over €250 million has been provided to the Council towards initiating, developing and enhancing a wide range of programmes aimed at increasing participation and raising standards in Irish sport.  My Department will continue to support the Sports Council to allow it to realise the commitments of its strategic plan to increase participation in sport and to improve the levels of performance by our elite athletes in world-class competition.  An important issue is to ensure the embedding of the Irish Institute of Sport as the key instrument in ensuring Ireland's sustained successes in top-level international sport.I also intend to provide continued support for the horse and greyhound racing industries, which are important contributors to the Irish economy and to employment throughout the country.

This is a timely document, as it presents an evaluation of the current status of the sector and its role in the changing and varying social and cultural landscape we face in the coming years.It should be noted that the NESF recognises that a substantial amount of worthwhile activity is taking place in the arts sector — much of which is State supported.  It highlights the need for the delivery of a high level service in the arts and culture sector in a strategic, appropriate, coordinated and open manner.In this context, the Government approved the report's recommendation for the establishment of a high-level independently chaired Strategy Committee to consider its recommendations.  I have now had the opportunity of reviewing the comprehensive range of recommendations made in this report and I envisage establishing the recommended Committee in the coming weeks.

Preliminary investigations undertaken on this matter indicate that the provision of work permits and related entry visas for those travelling from outside the European Union, has implications for a number of Government Departments, with potential complexities surrounding the processes which will necessitate wide ranging and detailed discussions.  The matter will be progressed with a view to establishing the most mutually beneficial and secure mechanism for addressing the issue.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.All applications received are assessed on their merits and evaluated against the programme's objective assessment criteria, which are outlined in the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions of the programme.  Recommended grant allocations are made in line with the amount requested by the applicant, the merits of the project and the overall funding available.Since 2002 the Sports Capital Programme has provided funding of over €153m for facilities and equipment in GAA clubs.  Details of all grants allocated each year are available on my Department's website, www.dast.gov.ie.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.The latest figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that there was an increase of over 4.1% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period in 2006.  While it will be challenging to maintain the record-breaking performance of 2006, these latest CSO figures confirm that Ireland's tourism sector continues to perform at a very impressive level.The number of visitors from Britain for the first eight months of the year is down by 1% compared to the same period in 2006.  However, figures for the four months from May to August show that there has been a good level of recovery in this market with each of the four months recording an increase in visitor numbers from Britain compared to the same months in 2006.  I am hopeful that this trend will continue in the coming months.  I am pleased to note also that the numbers coming to Ireland from Britain, for Holiday purposes, were actually up by almost 4% for the first half of the year.  Also, there is evidence that the decline in sea passenger traffic, seen in recent years has halted.  The sea carriers are reporting encouraging numbers and this is positive for both regional dispersal and length of stay.The drop in visitors from Britain in the early part of the year is consistent with a general trend of reduced numbers of outward travellers from Great Britain to European destinations.  It is believed that interest rate increases and other factors may be impacting on consumer discretionary spending power.Successful marketing, in any field, does require ongoing monitoring of markets and appropriate adjustment of campaigns.  Tourism is no exception.  An intense period of marketing activity is under way in Britain this autumn.  Attractive city break packages are a key element of this autumn campaign, focusing particularly on cities with direct links to the regions in Ireland.  A programme is also in place to attract motoring visitors.  In addition to TV and radio, Tourism Ireland has extensive print campaigns in national media and specialist titles.  In line with its now established reputation for innovative marketing, I understand that Tourism Ireland has devised some novel on-line promotions.Great Britain continues to be the largest single market for the island of Ireland.  Competition in this market is intense with new destinations on offer to the consumer.  In this highly competitive environment and against a background of changing consumer travel patterns, it remains a challenge to continue to deliver growth.While it is difficult to forecast exactly for the rest of the year, Tourism Ireland informs me that, in its opinion, the second half of the year is likely to be positive and that total visitor numbers for the year will be in line with last year's figures.

State support for the arts is mainly channelled through the Arts Council, which, although funded by my department, is completely autonomous in its decisions.  The level of funding and support for the Irish Theatre Institute is entirely a matter for the Arts Council and a matter in which I have no statutory function.Funding for the Arts Council has increased from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007 — an increase of almost 68%.  These are significant amounts of money in any context.  This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.The table shows the funding provided to the Arts Council between 1997 and 2007.YearFunding% ChangeSupplementary Estimate (not included)Total including Supplementary)€m199726.4126.41199833.1425.4833.14199935.557.2735.55200045.0826.8145.08200146.372.861.7748.14200247.672.8047.67200344.1-7.4944.1200452.519.05254.520056116.195.23366.233200672.3118.541082.3120078010.63

Accordingly, I have instructed officials in my Department to examine how best we can put longer and more flexible opening hours on a more permanent footing.  Discussions have commenced with the National Cultural Institutions on this matter.  There is a commitment in the Action Plans of the relevant National Cultural Institutions in the context of ‘Towards 2016' in respect of extended opening hours.The National Gallery of Ireland and the Irish Museum of Modern Art have both gone some way towards recognition of changed use of leisure time by, in the case of the Gallery: opening seven days a week and more than 360 days a year and providing late opening on Thursdays until 8.30 p.m.  In July and August 2007, the  Irish Museum of Modern Art  extended its opening hours on Thursdays till 8.30 p.m.In addition, during Culture Night 2007, which took place on 14 September, the National Cultural Institutions extended their opening hours until 10.00 p.m.  The National Gallery remained open until 11.00 p.m.  My Department provided €35,000 towards Culture Night, 2007 and €15,000 towards a similar event in 2006.  Culture Night is modelled on a similar event in some of the major European cities.Discussions with the relevant Institutions and with the Council of National Cultural Institutions (CNCI) have commenced at official level to determine how best to accommodate extended opening hours and any likely costs that may be associated with such extensions.

It is intended that this programme will continue.The work is being prioritised on the basis of risk to housing and while the OPW is at present finalising its programme for 2008, it is likely that the focus will be on the town of Listowel next year.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Detailed design of the Munster Blackwater (Fermoy North) Drainage Scheme, the first of three separate flood relief schemes for the town of  Fermoy, is now virtually complete.  The Office of Public Works is in the process of completing the Pre-Qualification process for the appointment of a contractor for the construction of the civil engineering works of the Scheme, which will allow tenders to be sought from the successful candidates within the next few weeks.  Once tenders are received, OPW will seek to have the Scheme Confirmed by the Minister for Finance, as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts.  This should allow construction works to commence in March/April, 2008.It is anticipated that the works on the Fermoy North Scheme will take approximately 12 months to complete.  Detailed cost estimates for the Fermoy North scheme will be available once tenders are received for the civil engineering works.  However, it is estimated that the costs of implementing all three schemes, including maintenance over the lifetime of all three schemes, will be in the region of €37 million at present values.   This is a tentative estimate at this stage and will be reviewed as detailed design of phases proceeds.  Detailed traffic management plans will be incorporated into the contractor's programme before construction commences.  Every effort will be made to minimise disruption to the town during construction.Detailed design of the Fermoy South West  Scheme will commence when construction on the North Scheme is under way.  The South East Scheme will follow similarly when construction commences on the South West Scheme.  Overall, it is expected that it take about four to five years to complete all three schemes.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I have noted the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service regarding the time limit for claiming refunds of overpaid tax.  My predecessor as Minister for Finance examined the whole question of taxpayers' entitlement to repayment of tax and interest with a view to introducing, in so far as practicable, a uniform scheme which was fair and reasonable for taxpayers, and which also took into account the position of the Exchequer.  On foot of that review, a new provision was introduced in Finance Act, 2003 (Section 17) which for the first time gave taxpayers a general right to repayment of tax overpaid subject to a 4 year claim limitation period.  This became effective for all claims received on or after 01 January 2005.  At the same time the right of the Revenue Commissioners to raise assessments and make enquiries was also reduced to a 4 year period, apart from cases where fraud or neglect is suspected.  The scheme was devised after careful and detailed consideration.  It was designed to achieve the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers, including parity of treatment between PAYE and self-employed taxpayers, while, at the same time, providing the necessary protection for the Exchequer from exposure to claims going back many years.Overall, I am satisfied that the current provision is both fair and reasonable and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this area.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car, up to a certain limit.The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme. However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.  In this context, I consider any possible changes within the framework of the annual Budgetary process.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as liability to income tax is established on the basis of a taxpayer's total taxable income their income tax statistics do not generally distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from different sources of income.  Accordingly the specific information requested by the Deputy is not available.With regard the second part of the Deputy's question, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The cost to the Exchequer of extending the PAYE credit to farmers and the self employed, including proprietary directors, is estimated at €610 million in a full year.  The cost of abolishing the PAYE credit and increasing the personal credit by the same amount is estimated at €750 million in a full year.  The additional cost would arise because the personal credit is transferable between spouses.The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using actual data for the year 2004 adjusted as necessary to take account of actual and projected income and employment growth in subsequent years and are rounded to the nearest hundred.  A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that figures are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for separately identifying the capital gains tax (CGT) yield from payments made to farmers in respect of lands acquired by local authorities for road widening.  Accordingly, the specific information is not readily available and either could not be obtained or could not be obtained without conducting a protracted investigation of the Revenue Commissioners' records.In the 2003 Budget roll-over relief was abolished for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I assume that the Deputy has in mind the re-introduction of roll-over relief.  It was announced in the 2003 Budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.Changes to the tax system are considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill cycle.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector.

This approach is recognised internationally as the best way to ensure that a wide range of impacts and options are considered so that reducing risk at one location in the catchment does not adversely affect risk elsewhere and that negative environmental outcomes are minimised. Any schemes that the study may recommend will be considered in conjunction with the Local Authorities in the context of available resources.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that clerical officers are promoted on a senior suitable basis in accordance with an agreed sequence of which currently 1 in 8 vacancies are filled by promotion to Staff Officer.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the only relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2004. RACs and PRSAs are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes.  A distribution by contribution ranges of the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs is contained in the tables that follow this reply. The information is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing about 96 % of all returns expected.A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.   It is not possible to provide corresponding figures in regard to the take-up of the tax relief for pension contributions by employers and employees to occupational pension schemes as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible. The Finance Act 2004 includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers from 2006 on. These changes will yield additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions. However, as the returns are aggregated at employer level, they will not provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of proposals for change to pension tax relief, including  across different income or contribution cohorts.Retirement Annuity Contract — by range of contributionSingle/WidowedRange of Retirement Annuity ContributionsTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in tax€€€€—50,00036,909157,993,03158,809,35750,00075,00033119,652,0648,186,38275,000100,0001098,301,6003,542,924100,000125,000125,000150,000150,000175,000Over175,000Totals37,349185,946,69570,538,663MarriedRange of Retirement  Annuity ContributionsTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in tax€€€€—50,00070,569441,475,862164,183,65850,00075,0001,811109,264,85445,829,48775,000100,00070855,005,11323,075,309100,000125,000364,034,0031,694,281125,000150,000182,365,851978,297150,000175,0005759,795319,114Over175,000Totals73,147612,905,478236,080,146Single/WidowedRange of PRSA ContributionsTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in tax€€€€—50,0002,6629,958,9383,717,90850,00075,0005304,583127,92575,000100,000100,000125,000125,000150,000150,000175,000Over175,000Totals2,66710,263,5213,845,833MarriedRange of PRSA ContributionsTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in tax€€€€—50,0003,33120,973,7087,964,64850,00075,000382,319,427974,15975,000100,00012939,177394,454100,000125,000125,000150,000150,000175,000Over175,000Totals3,38124,232,3129,333,261All CasesRange of ContributionsTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in tax€€€€—50,000113,471630,401,539234,675,57150,00075,0002,185131,540,92855,117,95375,000100,00082964,245,89027,012,687100,000125,000364,034,0031,694,281125,000150,000182,365,851978,297150,000175,0005759,795319,114Over175,000———Totals116,544833,348,006319,797,903
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	356	At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards. For medical card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income. Allowances are also made for expenses on child care, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.Currently, my Department is preparing legislation to clarify and update existing  legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services. The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework. My Department is currently examining the range of services that will be defined in legislation.  It is expected that the legislation will be published in 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 83 and 86 together.I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal reasons why it is not possible for the HSE to negotiate with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members. A detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, informed the final determination of the new reimbursement arrangements announced by the HSE. The evidence available to the HSE indicates that the impact on individual pharmacies will not be detrimental, having regard to the totality of fees and mark-ups under the GMS and community drugs schemes.In regard to the reimbursement prices for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes, the main wholesaler companies have recently confirmed to the HSE they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products.All the evidence available to the joint HSE/Department of Health and Children team dealing with this issue indicated that the State was paying a premium for this service and that the new arrangements will save the HSE about €100m in 2008.  The impact of the new arrangements on the incomes of pharmacists will depend on the extent of the discounts which individual pharmacists were getting from wholesalers under the previous arrangements. I am advised that large urban pharmacies and chains typically got discounts of up to 12% whereas small and rural pharmacies got discounts of 2-3%.A process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed. At a meeting on 11 October, the IPU maintained that it has a fundamental right as a trade union to fully represent its members on all issues. It appears, therefore, that the Union does not accept the legal position under competition law regarding negotiation on fees.In an effort to resolve the present impasse arising from the unilateral withdrawal of methadone services by some pharmacists, Mr Shipsey issued a statement on 19th October expressing confidence that the process of dialogue could be resumed, if these services could be restored. On foot of Mr. Shipsey's intervention, on 21st October the President of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union called on its members who have ceased providing this service, to resume service as soon as possible. The HSE have advised that the majority of pharmacists have now resumed dispensing methadone. The HSE contingency plan in relation to methadone dispensing will remain in operation for the present until such time as the HSE are satisfied that the necessary patient transfer controls to enable the safe return of patients to the community pharmacists, are in place. This is expected to take place within the next two days.I strongly welcome both interventions and would urge the remaining community pharmacists concerned to resume dispensing methadone as soon as possible. As soon as this is achieved it will be possible for renewed engagement to take place between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.

The Group in question is currently in receipt of staffing grant assistance under the EOCP scheme and this funding will continue in place until the end of December 2007.As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2008.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients have been invited to apply directly to the OMC under the new scheme by 2nd November 2007.  To facilitate them to adjust to the new scheme, transitional arrangements under which they will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008, will apply.As signalled when I announced the new scheme earlier this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in the coming weeks.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.

Applicants will be required to pay 80% of their assessable income towards the cost of their care. In addition, it is proposed that there will be a contribution of up to 5% against liquid and illiquid assets, capped at the cost of care.  I hope to publish the Bill for the new scheme at the end of this month. I would stress again that the scheme is a voluntary one and people who wish to meet the costs of long-term residential care themselves or on behalf of others can continue to do so.

In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.

Since then the RPA has undertaken significant detailed design work and engaged extensively with local communities and businesses.Arising from these consultations local alterations have been made to the preferred alignment.  These changes include the decision to go underground through Ballymun and to maximise the green space under which the Metro will run in the Drumcondra area.  Both of these changes arise from concerns from local interests raised in public consultations and the RPA has at all times sought to address these legitimate concerns whilst ensuring the overall integrity of the project.Clearly, these public consultations and consequential design changes already referred to have impacted on the timescale for the project.  However, I am satisfied that the approach taken by the RPA in seeking to address the concerns of local communities is the correct one.The Agency hopes to be in a position to lodge an application for a railway order to An Bord Pleanála early next year.  Subject to the grant of an enforceable railway order the RPA plans to commence construction of the project in 2009 with a target of commencing Metro operations in 2013.

I believe that many of the leaders of the UDA, and their political advisors in the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG), accept the need for change and have shown some leadership in trying to move forward and to deliver on it.  But they now need to go significantly further.Following violence in Carrickfergus and Bangor in early August, Minister Ritchie imposed a 60 day deadline for the UDA leadership to engage in a real and meaningful manner with the IICD, linking this with continued funding by her Department for the ‘Conflict Transformation Initiative' (CTI).  Her deadline having expired, Minister Ritchie last week took the difficult decision that funding of the CTI should cease, and to use the money instead for projects in disadvantaged loyalist areas.There were divergent views in the Assembly and in the Executive on how best to proceed on this issue, including differences on some legal issues.  It is important to note, however, that there was clear unanimity on the need for the UDA to continue the process of transformation, and to move away decisively from paramilitary activity and to proceed with the decommissioning of its arms.The Government firmly shares that goal, and I have made that clear, including in my public statement on this matter.The Government's core objective is that no community should be left behind as Northern Ireland moves forward to an era of genuine peace, stability and prosperity.  I would encourage, and look forward to, progressive elements within loyalism showing continued leadership and vision, including on the issue of decommissioning, in the period ahead.

Pakistan opened an Embassy in Dublin in 2001, headed by a resident Ambassador, with whom senior officials of the Department are in regular contact.Our Ambassador in Tehran is accredited to Pakistan on a non-resident basis.  He pays regular visits to Pakistan and keeps in regular contact with the authorities there, with the resident diplomatic community, with the media and with civil society.  Senior officials from the Department also visit Pakistan from time to time.As part of our ongoing contact and dialogue, we share our concerns with the Government of Pakistan regarding the struggle against terrorism in Pakistan and on its border with Afghanistan, radicalism and extremism in parts of the country, military rule, and issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In all our recent contacts we have expressed our strong hopes for successful, free and fair elections and a return to democracy and civilian rule.  The development of economic and cultural links is also discussed.  Pakistan is a country of high strategic importance and, when the country has returned to civilian rule and democracy, we would be interested in strengthening our relationship still further.  We are hoping to hold political consultations at official level in Islamabad next year to discuss this further.In addition to Ireland's bilateral relationship with Pakistan, the EU also has an important and active relationship with the country. Given Pakistan's strategic importance, the EU has recently agreed to further develop its relationship with Pakistan.As regards the political situation in Pakistan, I outlined my views on the current situation in my response to Parliamentary Questions regarding Pakistan in Dail Eireann on Tuesday, 23 October.In that statement, I expressed our strong hope that In that statement, I expressed our strong hope that Pakistan is on a course back to democracy.  The road to democracy, stability and economic and social development will not be an easy one.  A particular problem in the lead-up to parliamentary elections, expected to take place in January, is the subversion and havoc that militants and extremists can create.  We saw the appalling massacre that militants mounted on Benazir Bhutto's return to her country last week but attacks on the authorities, military, the media and civilians take place almost daily.  Although such militancy is shared by only a small percentage of Pakistan's population, the ability of the terrorists and radicals to inflict devastating damage is deeply troubling.  Other problems include restrictions on the freedom of expression and the media, widespread corruption, and near-feudal conditions, accompanying undeveloped party political traditions, in some of the more remote rural and tribal areas.But there are also some positive developments that have taken place in the country, particularly President Musharraf's recent commitment to withdraw from a military role and his nomination of a successor as Army Chief of Staff, which increases hopes that here will be an end to military rule in the coming months.  The political parties and the public are intensely engaged in what will clearly be a hotly-contested election campaign.  The Pakistan Elections Commission, with some external help, has been working to put systems in place to ensure that these elections are free and fair.  The role of the Supreme Court over recent months has also demonstrated its very clear independence.  And despite the obstacles that exist to freedom of expression, there is a vibrant and independent media in Pakistan, which speaks out very openly on all aspects of Pakistani life and politics — an enormous tribute to the commitment, professionalism and courage of those involved in the media in Pakistan and very encouraging for the future of democracy in Pakistan.

This Task Force includes experts from the sport, tourism, cultural and business sectors and is supported by staff within my Department.  One of the first pieces of work that the Task Force carried out was an audit of high quality sports facilities suitable to attract international athletes to train in the years leading up to the London 2012 Olympic Games.In parallel with this audit and to better inform the future work of the Task Force, my Department appointed Indecon International Economic Consultants to carry out an economic evaluation of the benefit to the island of Ireland of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.  This evaluation has now been completed and the Task Force is considering the findings and recommendations.  I expect to receive the recommendations of the Task Force in the near future.  The cost of the Task Force to date is €77,000.

One of the stated aims and objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2002, it was decided that only those areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CLAR areas should be treated as disadvantaged under the programme.Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways during the assessment of applications. They are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available (20% as against the normal 30%) towards their project, and extra marks are also awarded to such projects during the assessment process under the socio-economic disadvantage criterion.Successful projects under the sports capital programme in CLAR and RAPID areas may qualify to receive additional top-up funding, payable by the Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in addition to their sports capital allocation.  In the case of projects located in CLAR areas, this top-up funding can be up to 20% of the sports capital grant amount; in the case of projects located in RAPID areas which are also endorsed by their local Area Implementation Team, the top-up funding can be up to 30%.The 2007 sports capital programme was advertised in the national press in October 2006.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was 24th November 2006.  Over 1,530 applications were received for the programme and provisional allocations totalling €85 million were made to 935 projects on 5th April last.  For the Deputy's information, grants totalling €38,679,550 were allocated to 455 projects in disadvantaged areas under the 2007 sports capital programme.  To date, my colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has announced top-ups for qualifying grantees of €6,412,510.While no date has been set for the 2008 Programme, advertisements announcing the next round of the Programme will be placed in the national press and application forms will be available at that stage.  Applicants who feel that they have a project that meet the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions of the programme are free to apply at that stage. I can confirm that no discussions have been held with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform in regard to the issue mentioned by the Deputy.

It is also informed by the Agreed Programme for Government which, in addition to a series of specific provisions for Tourism, commits the Government to provide the sector with sustained support and investment in the coming years. To underpin that support, the National Development Plan provides for an investment of almost €800m in Tourism during the period of the Plan.The Government has committed to spend €335m on Tourism Marketing under the National Development Plan. This money, which will be channelled via my Department's Vote, will help Tourism Ireland to promote the island of Ireland in innovative and creative ways, though a range of media, including digital media, in our key markets.The levels of Tourism growth which we have been experiencing in 2006 and this year — 10% and 4% (Jan to August) respectively — suggest that Ireland is gaining market share.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The profile of pension members is provided by regular CSO surveys on pension coverage, which are part of the Quarterly National Household Survey. Results were published in 2006 in respect of Quarter 4 2005, and another coverage survey can be expected in 2009. Further information on the relationship between employer characteristics (detailed sector, size of employer, etc.) and pension coverage can be expected from the 2008 National Employment Survey in 2009 or 2010.While pension coverage statistics are available from various sources, information on the typical value of supplementary pensions is less well developed. Pension levels depend on the type of coverage (i.e., whether the scheme or pension plan is defined benefit or defined contribution). For defined contribution pensions, benefits can be affected by a range of risks, including investment and longevity risks. Contribution levels are a crucial determinant of final pension levels for these schemes, and research provided by CSO for the Pensions Green Paper puts average contribution rates to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts at 10.5 per cent of income. There are, of course, concerns that this level of contributions is not adequate to meet the aim in the Programme for Government to secure a retirement income from all sources of at least 50% of pre-retirement earnings. Average contribution rates to occupational defined contribution schemes are broadly similar. In addition, information on incomes of current pensioners is outlined in the Pensions Green Paper, including a breakdown of the sources of these incomes.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions. This exclusion recognises the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine employment relationship in circumstances such as when a person employed under a contract of service (i.e. as an employee) by his or her spouse is classed as an "excepted" contributor under social welfare law. As a result, farming spouses, in common with spouses of other self-employed persons, can only pay PRSI contributions if they are involved in one of three scenarios.Firstly, spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership (as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property) are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus liable to social insurance contributions. These    contributions — made under PRSI Class S — enable them to build up an insurance record in their own right and to receive accruing benefits. A partnership is commonly understood to be an association of two or more persons for the purpose of gain or of sharing in the work and profits of an enterprise. Liability for PRSI contributions is not contingent on the ownership of property but rather on the nature of the business arrangements between the couple. Co-ownership of property does not in itself create a partnership.Secondly, where a family business or farming enterprise is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a social insurance record as either employees or as self-employed contributors — depending on whether a contract of service exists.Finally, a spouse engaged in off-farm employment, will pay social insurance contributions in his or her own right. This enables farming spouses who might otherwise not be insured to develop a social insurance record on the basis of their off-farm earnings.An information leaflet is currently being developed between the Department of Social & Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It has been agreed with the farming representatives that their views and input will feed into this process to ensure the new publication meets with their information needs and is customer orientated.  It is hoped to publish the new information leaflet by end 2007.Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to improve the income limits associated with the qualified adult allowance to enable more people to qualify for it. The limits will be reviewed in the context of the budget.On a more general note, issues relating to means testing of qualified adult pension payments are discussed in the Green Paper on pensions and decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the consultation process which is now underway and the development on the framework for long-term pensions policy.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	386	It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions. In the case of contributory pensions, this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate.  The state pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system.A special pension for the self-employed was introduced in 1999 to enable people who were over age 56 at the time of the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed in 1988, and who could not therefore meet the standard qualifying conditions, to receive a contributory pension. The qualifying conditions require payment of 260 contributions. At present there are about 3,300 such pensions in payment.The arrangements introduced in 1999 are designed to give some recognition under the social welfare pensions system to a group of people who would not otherwise qualify for any payment, contributory or means tested. The pension was considered a reasonable response to the position this particular group of people found themselves in, and it represents very good value for the level of contributions paid.In the absence of a full assessment of the insurance records of those concerned, it is not possible to give an actual cost of converting this pension to a pro-rata payment related to the actual number of contributions made.  A rough estimate of the cost, including the granting of a pro-rata increase for qualified adults, would be approximately €9 million per annum. However, the true cost of such a measure could be far higher as, in equity, it would be difficult to enhance the pensions of this group of pensioners without considering the position of other people such as those receiving the special pension based on pre 1953 social insurance contributions, or possibly, other people receiving standard rate reduced pensions.As already said, when introduced, this pension was considered a reasonable response to the situation that existed at the time and, in my view, this remains the position.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding through two schemes towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities.  The second is the school meals community (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects, including breakfast clubs.The Department of Education and Science identified a total of 875 disadvantaged schools under the ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS) action plan in 2005.  Approximately 400 of these schools were already receiving school meal funding.The remaining schools were invited to apply for funding in August/September 2006.  To date, a total of 651 DEIS schools are participating in the scheme.The school meals programme has expanded significantly in recent years.  The number of meals being provided on a daily basis to disadvantaged children through the school meals local projects scheme has doubled from 89,915 in the school year 2005/2006 to 179,660 in the school year 2006/2007.  In 2006, some 1,394 schools with over 145,000 pupils benefited under the scheme.  This is expected to increases to more than 165,000 pupils in over 1,800 schools throughout the state in 2007.The school meals programme makes an important contribution to ensuring that school children receive better nutrition and contributes to improved school attendance and quality of learning.  All relevant research indicates that there is a strong link between nutritional intake and cognitive ability and that inadequate nutrition impacts negatively on a child's ability to learn and benefit from education.I am satisfied that the additional funding given to the school meals programme in recent years has enabled the programme to expand significantly and to assist schools and projects to provide healthy, nutritious food to the most disadvantaged children in our society who, by reason of lack of food, are unable to take full advantage of the educational opportunities presented to them.The focus of the school meals scheme will remain on disadvantaged children and the inclusion of eligible DEIS schools in the scheme will continue to be my Department's main priority.

The advance payment of €729.89 under the 2007 Single Payment Scheme issued to the person named on 16 October.Eligibility under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, requires, inter alia, a minimum of three forage hectares located within a designated Disadvantaged Area and a minimum stocking density for the holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, for a three-consecutive month period.  As all the land declared by the person named is designated as Arable hectares, the person named is ineligible under the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme and is, therefore, not due any payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.The particular issue referred to in this question is where a primary product can enter Ireland and processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded as an Irish product is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, Codex and EU legislation governing the EU Customs Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and have raised my concerns at EU Council level.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health & Children.  Within this submission Ireland again raised the matter of the unsatisfactory nature of the concept of substantial transformation and the possibility of it being used to disguise the origin of products from the public.  I believe that the concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem.In the meantime my Department has been involved in consultations with the Department of Health and Children on drafting new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat as is the case with beef.A public consultation on the proposed regulations took place during the past month via the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with the final date for receipt of comments being the 19th October.  These comments will now be examined and the proposed legislation will be reviewed in the light of comments received.  This process will take approximately three weeks.  Thereafter the draft legislation will have to be forwarded to the European Commission.  The commencement date for the legislation will depend on the Commission's response and possibly that of other Member States.In the proposed legislation ‘origin' will be defined as the country where the animal was reared and, if different, the country of slaughter.  This will have to be indicated on meat and meat products containing over 70% meat.  Regardless of the nature, extent or location of processing or packaging that has gone into the manufacture of the product the requirement to show actual country of rearing and slaughter of the animal will remain in place and this will not be superseded by any ‘substantial transformation'.

However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports, or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.  The person named was written to and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the number of sheep maintained on his farm. On receipt of a satisfactory response from the person named, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.With regard to the Single Payment Scheme, the governing regulations provide for a payment date of 1 December, however, following my approach to the EU Commissioner, I secured approval for the early payment of advances from 16 October, with balancing payments to be made from 1 December.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture published its report on the Early Retirement Schemes in February 2005.  The report dealt with a range of issues relating to the first Scheme of Early Retirement from Farming which was open to new entrants from 1994 to 1999 and the second Scheme which was open to new entrants from 2000 to 2006. I responded in detail to the report in September 2005.As I explained in my response, certain of the Committee's recommendations were precluded by the EU Regulations under which the Schemes were operated.  I saw some merit in other aspects of the Committee's report, however, specifically those relating to income limits.  In line with the Committee's recommendations, I increased the off-farm income limit for transferees in the 2000–2006 Scheme from €25,400 to €40,000 and abolished the income limit for transferors with effect from 1 September 2006.The Committee paid particular attention to two further issues.  One was the implication of decoupling for retired farmers who had leased out land and quota to transferees before or during the Single Payment Scheme reference period.  I believe we secured the best deal that we could for people in this situation, in spite of the reluctance of the Commission at the outset.  A specific mandatory category was included in the National Reserve arrangements under the Single Payment Scheme.  This category caters for farmers who inherited or otherwise received a holding free of charge or for a nominal amount from a farmer who retired or died before 16 May 2005 where the land in question was leased out to a third party during the reference period.  Under these arrangements, where a farm reverted to the retired farmer at the end of a lease without any entitlements, the farmer taking it over will have access to the National Reserve.  Retired farmers in the Early Retirement Scheme who farmed during part or all of the reference period and who held Single Payment entitlements could activate entitlements and lease them to their transferees.  If the transferee did not wish to use the entitlements, a transferor had until 2007 to lease the entitlements with land to another farmer.  Once at least 80% of the entitlements have been used by the lessee, the transferor had the option to sell the entitlements with or without land; otherwise, he can continue to lease the entitlements with land.The second issue the Joint Committee focused on was the levels of payment under the two Schemes.  In the course of discussions on this issue, the European Commission had pointed out that the rate in the earlier Scheme was set at the maximum amount for co-funding that the Regulation allowed, and that it would not be possible to secure co-funding for an increase in the rate of pension for existing participants in the 2000–2006 Scheme. The Commission indicated at a later stage, however, that it would not oppose increases for existing participants in both Schemes if they were funded entirely from the national exchequer as a State aid. I therefore announced substantial increases in the maximum pension rates payable under both Schemes which took effect from 1 November 2006. I increased the maximum pension rate payable under the 1994–1999 Scheme from €12,075 to €14,075 per annum and the maximum pension rate payable under the 2000–2006 Scheme from €13,515 to €15,000 per annum.  These increases will cost some €33 million extra over the remaining period of the two Schemes, and over 5,000 retired farmers will benefit from them.The maximum pension rate payable under the new Early Retirement Scheme, which was launched on 13 June 2007 and will run for the period 2007–2013 is €15,000 per annum.The Joint Committee also raised issues about a number of cases in which farmers had entered the 1994–99 Scheme under the joint management arrangement.  The three application types possible under that Scheme (sole application, joint ownership and joint management) were set down in my Department's Guidelines and the Scheme document.  The joint management option meant that the Scheme was available to some farm households which would otherwise not have been able to benefit at all, and in other cases it meant that the pension could be paid for a longer period.A number of participants who joined the Scheme under the joint management arrangement claimed to have not understood at the time that national retirement pensions payable to either or both parties in such cases would have to be deducted from the Early Retirement pension.  Some of the individuals concerned argued to the Joint Committee that they should be able to change retrospectively the basis on which they entered the Scheme.The Scheme does not allow for retrospective changes unless there are new facts or evidence that show that individual applications were wrongly classified in the first place. The requirement for the deduction of both spouses' national retirement pensions under the joint management arrangement was stated at the time in my Department's Guidelines and the Scheme document.  Applicants for the Scheme, in consultation with their agricultural and or legal advisors, had an opportunity to decide on how best to structure the application to their best advantage, having regard to their individual circumstances and the Scheme conditions.  My Department adjudicated on the eligibility of each application in accordance with the Scheme conditions.

The person named was successful under the New Entrant measure and had the years 2000 and 2001 omitted from the calculation of his Single Payment.The person named applied under Category B of the 2005 National Reserve which catered for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments included purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.The person named applied under B (I) in respect of investment in the long-term leasing of land. However, the lease submitted stated that he was also leasing in a Milk Quota with the land.  Therefore, he was deemed ineligible under this category as the investment made was regarded as not being directly linked to a farming sector for which direct payments under the Livestock and Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period.  A letter outlining this decision issued to the person named.The person named submitted an appeal against my Department's decision.  This appeal was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who upheld my Department's decision.  A letter outlining the decision of the Committee also issued to the person named.Subsequently the person named submitted additional information in which it was clarified that there was no Milk Quota being leased with the land.  His National Reserve application was reviewed and was now deemed eligible.However, as the person named also benefited under the New Entrant measure, the Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that checks must be made to ensure that an allocation from the National Reserve, to an applicant who has already benefited under other measures associated with the Single Payment Scheme, does not result in double benefit. An applicant may only benefit from the measure that is most beneficial.In this regard it has been established that the New Entrant measure was financially more beneficial and the National Reserve has been rescinded in favour of the New Entrant measure.  A letter outlining this decision has issued to the person named on 10 September 2007.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and would take an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children. Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.

The number of early intervention classes for children with autism funded by my Department is increasing. Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 ½ years to 5 who are not enrolled in early intervention classes. Up to 3 years of age, a child is funded for ten hours per week early intervention home based programme. This increases to 20 hours per week once the child is 3 years of age.The terms of School Transport Scheme may only be considered in respect of educational facilities which are recognised by my Department; therefore, the question of providing transport to private pre-schools does not arise.

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer for South Co. Tipperary and Bus Éireann have advised that the transport service in question is operating to capacity. Families who have not been allocated seats should continue to liaise with Bus Éireann regarding availability.The Programme for Government includes a commitment to review the school transport scheme, including catchment boundaries. My Department is currently considering how best to progress this task.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	409	A Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year has been developed and is currently being piloted in schools. The programme provides a structured approach towards the development of responsible attitudes towards road safety and driver education and builds on the knowledge gained from current Social Personal and Health Education programmes (SPHE). Covering areas such as seatbelt use, hazard perception and driver attitudes towards alcohol and drug use the Transition Year Road Safety Programme will also prepare students for the Driver Theory Test. The Road Safety Authority has also obtained input from the Gardaí, NCT centres and Bus Eireann in the delivery of this programme.In April 2007, the Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched covering key road safety issues. This has been piloted successfully in schools and will be available for live implementation in 07/08. In addition, the Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others, can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.  My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the Board of Management of each individual school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a child. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.An appeal under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 was heard in April 2007 in respect of a refusal by St. Canice's School to enrol the child referred to by the Deputy. The appeal was not upheld. I am informed that the National Educational Welfare Board are actively working on this case and that an assessment has been carried out on this child to ascertain an appropriate placement. The Board continues to work to find an appropriate school placement for this child. In the interim, home tuition has been sanctioned for the child pending provision of a suitable placement.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I am very aware of the concerns of parents, teachers and voluntary organisations regarding the content available to children via the internet, whether this be through PCs or mobile phones.   There is an increasing level of convergence across new communications technologies, including access to internet services through mobile phones.   This can include child pornography, racist or hate material, intimidation and bullying.  The internet however is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it. Combating illegal and harmful use of the internet requires a combination of responses at national and international level — legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, parents and guardians.  As with most jurisdictions the principle applied in the State is that what is unlawful on the ground is also unlawful on the internet.One of my first steps as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was to provide for the establishment of the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) as an executive office within my Department.  Arrangements for the staffing and headquartering of the office are well advanced, and I expect the office to be fully functioning shortly.  The new Office will continue to build on the work of the Internet Advisory Board which was set up in February, 2002 following the Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful use of the Internet.  It will oversee and further develop the self-regulatory regime for the Irish internet service providers, encourage best practice procedures; promote awareness of the internet downside issues and provide advice and facilitate research on internet related issues regarding child safety.  The OIS will also be tasked with investigating, in conjunction with the An Garda Síochána, the issue of applying blocking technology to the internet, and will consider the possibility of operating some form of symbol assignment to content as a method of rating such content as age appropriate within Ireland.The OIS will also continue to oversee the operation of the Hotline (www.hotline.ie — the system for dealing with reports of illegal content on the internet). The Hotline is funded by the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan.  It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the internet.  It plays an important part by accepting reports, providing the resources to validate them and channel those that are illegal directly to the appropriate jurisdiction and authority.  If the material is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP) to remove it, in accordance with their Code of Practice and Ethnics.  Special protocols operate between the Gardaí and the Hotline that maximise cooperation on law enforcement issues.  The Hotline provides a first port of call for parents and members of the public in general who encounter illegal material on the internet.The Hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of, the international INHOPE Association (www.inhope.org), a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world.  The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.  I recently launched two new booklets in the GET with IT! Series on behalf of the Internet Advisory Board (IAB).  The first booklet "Get with IT" A Parents Guide to new media technologies is an update on the Board's first "Get with IT" booklet which was originally published in September, 2005 and was a major success. That booklet gave an overview of new technologies for parents in an effort to address their potential worries about the dangers of the new media for their children.The second booklet  "Get with IT" A Parents' Guide to filtering technologies helps parents navigate the processes of how to use filtering technology.  One of the more effective measures a parent can use to protect children from the dangers of illegal or harmful content on the internet is through the use of filtering software.  Filtering software is a program that ‘filters' out and blocks inappropriate internet content before children can see it on the computer screen.  Experience has shown that filtering tools are capable of filtering potentially harmful content without seriously degrading the internet experience of the youngster.  In most cases, computers will already have ‘filters' that one can use for free. All a person has to do is switch them on including options for downloading additional filtering software.  This booklet should assist parents in deciding on how to choose a particular package to suit their needs.Copies of these publications were distributed widely and can be had on request through a freefone number 1800 24 25 95. They are also available on the website of my Department at <www.justice.ie>.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.The Reception & Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is principally charged with two sets of responsibility (1) accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for asylum are processed and (2) to develop, drive and coordinate integration policy across other Government departments, agencies and services for all legally resident migrants and to coordinate the Government's resettlement programme.In July 2006, the RIA placed a national advertisement seeking expressions of interest from persons who could offer suitable accommodation for asylum seekers.  The RIA continues to receive offers of accommodation on foot of this advertisement. In fulfilling its remit to provide accommodation for asylum seekers, the RIA examines all offers of accommodation for their suitability and decisions on the possible use of individual premises are taken on the basis of current needs at any particular time.In the case of the premises referred to by the Deputy, the RIA has approved its use as a direct provision accommodation centre for asylum seekers.  The centre complex comprises a series of buildings, viz., the original building described by the Deputy; twelve single storey bungalow-type chalets; and eighteen two storey duplex ‘townhouses'.  All of these units are collectively viewed by RIA as a single centre with an overall capacity of 328 persons.  The different types of accommodation elements are accessed depending on the family profile of the asylum seekers assigned to the centre at any one time.  The numbers allocated to each part of the centre will also vary in accordance with the family make-up.  The actual number accommodated at the centre on 14/10/07 was 328, i.e., its full capacity.Services at asylum seeker accommodation centres are provided to RIA on a fixed cost, flat rate basis.  All costs related to the provision of the service is borne by the contractor.  Between December 1999 and 10 April 2000 (when Direct Provision was introduced) the rates paid to providers of direct provision ranged from €200-€344 per person per week (pppw).  Since that time and despite considerable inflationary pressures, the RIA have achieved reductions in the rates paid which now fall within the normal range of €189-255 pppw.  Contracts for services at direct provision centres are not usually issued on a calendar year basis, i.e., they usually begin at some point during a year and could range in length from six months to a number of years.  The RIA is unable to provide the detailed financial information requested as its release could prejudice the competitive position of the State but can confirm that the rates are within the range stated.Separately from its function of accommodating those in the asylum process and in fulfilment of its integration function, the RIA has contracted a separate building in the same town consisting of fifteen apartments, which is being used as an Orientation Centre for programme refugees admitted under a UN resettlement programme.  Programme Refugees will spend approximately eight weeks in the centre where they will be provided with intensive cultural orientation and language training programme to prepare them for independent living in the community.  The children between the ages of six and eighteen years undergo a separate programme to prepare for entry into mainstream education.  On completion of the eight week orientation programme, the resettled refugees will transfer to other parts of the country for permanent resettlement.  This Orientation Centre is currently assisting approximately fifty two refugees from Myanmar/Burma who will move to Castlebar in mid November for permanent resettlement.

The statutory requirements for naturalisation are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  This provides that applicants for naturalisation, other than spouses of Irish citizens, must have been resident in the State for five years of the nine year period prior to the date of application.  Resident in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not granted for the purposes of study or seeking asylum.A foreign national married to an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident on the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage concerned must be recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting.

This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.The Programme makes major commitments in relation to national waste policy, including, in particular, an emphasis on moving away from a high reliance on incineration. In this regard it is intended that there will be an increased commitment to the use of alternative technologies, including mechanical and biological treatment.

Such allowances are payable with effect from the date of appointment of the member to the Advisory Council and are additional to the annual expenses allowances otherwise payable to elected members of local authorities.  Payment can be made by the appointing local authority or, with agreement of the relevant local authorities, by the Advisory Council.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Ireland has seen dramatic improvements in municipal waste recycling over the past decade.  The most recent National Waste Report, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states that the recovery rate for municipal waste in 2005 was 34.6%.  This was almost four times the equivalent figure for 1998, which was 9%.  These increases in recycling rates were achieved through a range of measures including segregated collections for dry recyclables and the provision of a nationwide network of bring facilities where materials can be deposited for recycling.  Notwithstanding these increases, high quality mechanical and biological treatment of residual municipal waste can contribute to further improvements in municipal waste recovery and recycling particularly in relation to metals and plastics.Demand for recyclable material remains strong internationally as evidenced by high prices for plastics and metals.  As outlined in successive National Waste Reports, Ireland relies significantly on foreign-based materials recycling infrastructure, which dealt with 83% of recycled waste in 2005. Europe accounts for 86% of all recyclable waste exported from Ireland.A Market Development Programme for Waste Resources 2007-2011 was published in April 2007.  The purpose of the Programme is to promote stable demand for recovered materials, including materials recovered at MBT plants, and to support the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials, as well as the need for more recycling infrastructure in Ireland to reduce reliance on overseas markets.  The Programme also seeks to identify new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products.  Implementation arrangements for the Programme will be put in place shortly.

These regulations implement Article 6(2) of Directive 2006/11/EC (which replaced Directive 76/464/EEC) on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment, which requires discharges that are liable to contain any of a range of substances to have prior authorisation by a competent authority.Compliance with the requirements of the EU Directive 91/271/EEC in relation to secondary treatment of wastewater discharges has risen from 25% at the start of 2000 to 90% at present.  All remaining schemes required to achieve full compliance are included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-25 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The position in this case is that a judgment against Ireland was made by the European Court of Justice on 14 November 2002 in relation to the quality of over 1600 public and group scheme drinking water supplies.  Since then, my Department has put in place an extensive programme of remediation measures for both the public schemes and the group water schemes cited in the judgment and has reported regularly to the Commission on progress under this programme and on the monitoring results for those schemes.An Article 228 Reasoned Opinion regarding this case was issued by the Commission in March 2007 and a response issued to the Commission in May 2007.  There is ongoing consultation between my officials and the Commission in relation to this case and it is one of the infringement cases that I discussed at my meeting with Commissioner Dimas in July, shortly after taking up office.In relation to the transposition of the Directive, the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 278 of 2007) were made on 12 June 2007.  These Regulations apply to both public drinking water supplies and group water scheme supplies.  Following formal notification to the Commission by my Department of the making of these Regulations, the Commission has indicated that it is satisfied that the Drinking Water Directive 98/83/EEC (which replaced the Drinking Water Directive 80/778/EEC) has been fully transposed into Irish law.

The Act, in this regard, prohibits a private rental tenant engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.  The Residential Tenancies Act also provides for a third party affected by anti-social behaviour to take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.  The Board can direct the landlord to ensure that tenants comply with their obligations and can enforce compliance through the Courts.The Private Residential Tenancies Board also has a role in keeping the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act under review and for the making of recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments.

Schedule 6 of the Regulations sets out the information to be contained in an EIS and specifies that it must include "a description of the aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected by the proposed development, including in particular ... material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, and the cultural heritage".As indicated in the reply to Question No. 579 of 23 October 2007, in the course of a Reasoned Opinion received in June 2007 the European Commission expressed its view that under the requirements of the EIA Directive a new environmental impact assessment was required before a decision was taken on how to proceed in relation to the newly discovered national monument at Lismullin.  Ireland responded in detail to the concerns raised by the Commission, indicating that the Irish authorities consider that the provisions of EU and Irish Law were full complied with in this case and that they are supported in that view by legal advice from the Attorney General as well as judgements from the High and Supreme courts.  The Commission has now decided to refer its infringement complaint to the European Court of Justice and it will be a matter for that Court to determine the legal issues involved in due course.There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to maximise and clarify the protection provided to our archaeological heritage.  On foot of this commitment I have initiated a comprehensive review, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, of archaeological policy and practice in Ireland.  It is my intention, following the review, to bring forward any necessary measures, including legislative proposals, to enhance the protection we afford to our archaeological heritage.

As I announced recently, I have already directed my Department to commission such a review, to commence as soon as possible and to conclude in the shortest possible timeframe.This review will involve comprehensive research on the waste sector in Ireland and will cover a wide range of issues to help identify how best to proceed with further efforts to reduce waste levels, improve recycling rates and deliver cost-effective waste management solutions for businesses and householders. Included in its scope will be an examination of the legal, institutional and infrastructure arrangements that apply to waste management.

No. 140 of 2006) gives effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the national authority with overall responsibility for implementing the Regulations.  Implementation at local level is a matter for local authorities concerned, Dublin Airport Authority, the National Roads Authority, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency.On noise from major roads, I refer to the reply to Question No. 375 of 17 October, 2007.

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level.  To date, the European Union has adopted two directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).Regulations transposing the European Communities (Access to information on the Environment) Directive 2003/4/EC were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is well advanced with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems.  The remaining work on the outstanding consent systems will be completed at the earliest possible date.Having regard to the above, I will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil as soon as possible.

Biomass in this context refers to wood pellets technology.One of the main drivers of the Greener Homes Scheme is to demonstrate to the consumer that wood fuels are a realistic alternative to oil and gas in terms of convenience and comfort.  To this end it has focused to date on ‘processed' fuels that can be fed automatically and not require regular user attendance.I am keeping the Greener Homes Scheme under regular review including the scope for encompassing other heating technologies based on advice from Sustainable Energy Ireland.
