          <p eId="para_50">This new section provides for the method by which notices in writing pursuant to sections 7 and 16 are to be served. The provision is similar to those on the same subject in other Acts. Examples are to be found in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act, the Communications Regulation Act, the Aviation Regulation Act and the Teaching Council Act 2001, among many others. It simply states a notice under section 7 or 16 shall be addressed to the person concerned by name and may be served on or given to the person in one of the following ways: by delivery; by leaving it at the address at which the person ordinarily resides or, in the case in which address for service has been furnished, at that address; or by sending it by prepaid registered post to an address where the person ordinarily resides or at an address for service, where this has been agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">This is a standard provision. Proof is not something about which we should get too worried. If someone claims he or she served or left a letter at a certain place, he or she will have to provide some proof. However, it is not like a summons in that accidental failure to serve would not be catastrophic in any particular case.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">These are all either-or provisions. If one delivers a letter directly to a person, there is no doubt about delivery. Generally there is no doubt about this in the case of a pre-paid registered letter for which a person signs. However, if it is sent to the address where a person ordinarily resides, one might have difficulty proving this. It seems paragraph (<i>b</i>) is not as watertight as either paragraph (<i>a</i>) or (<i>c</i>). Is the Minister leaving himself open?</p>

          <p eId="para_55">We live in an age in which it is usual to have motorcycle couriers make deliveries. If they make a mistake or deliver to the wrong address, there may or may not be consequences. We are dealing with an initial warning notice and, under section 17, a final offer. There will not be massive disputes about whether they were or were not served. A prudent solicitor, with whom we will be dealing in the great majority of cases, will avail of paragraph (<i>c</i>) and send it by pre-paid registered letter to the address. One of the problems we have discovered is that many people in different contexts do not collect registered letters. There was a time when there was always someone home. Now, however, the postman could be hunting around for months on end trying to effect service.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">This is one of the outstanding issues causing problems. A reduction in the period of limitation from three years to one was proposed.

In the main, this is broadly agreed to as the correct balance between the rights of claimants and those of defendants. However, there is still a strong case to be made in respect of workplace accidents where there is a view on the part of insurers that even the figure of two years is a little high.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">The main outstanding issue is in respect of medical negligence. Representations were made to me and, I have no doubt, others. From what I have read about the issue there seems to be general acceptance that medical negligence claims fall into a separate category from ordinary personal injuries claims. There is a variety of reasons for this. It is a matter of the trust a person has in his or her doctor and the fact that if problems arise, one's main concern is to work with medical personnel to find a solution rather than thinking of claims. If efforts are made to remedy a medical or surgical error, the process can take a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">People have enormous confidence in the medical profession which is mostly fully justified. While there may be complaints about the health service and public facilities, there is no doubt that those involved in the medical area have a proud record. When a problem emerges, one must go through the process of trying to find a remedy, coming to terms with it and finding an explanation. This case has been adequately made by the various organisations with an interest in this area. The organisation Patient Focus, in particular, has made its views known because of its involvement in the recent case of the Drogheda obstetrician and the position of some of his patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Does the Minister accept, as most others do, that medical negligence claims fall into a different category? If so, can we provide for a more balanced way of dealing with this area? I accept that the time limit of two years represents a balanced solution in the case of ordinary claims but if medical negligence claims fall into a different category, the fulcrum moves and the balance becomes different. This is the point of view from which I bring forward my proposal. I do not do so in the sure and certain knowledge that it is the best answer but it is an effort to present an approach that might provide a solution to one of the few remaining controversial issues arising from the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_73">Amendment No. 17 attempts to do more or less the same thing. It would provide that amendments affecting this section would not apply to actions for personal injuries arising from medical negligence or other actions falling outside the jurisdiction of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or actions for personal injuries which are so serious as to significantly impair the plaintiff's capacity to institute proceedings within two years from the date of the incident concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The Law Society has specifically requested that we mention the area of medical negligence in which the circumstances can be of enormous complexity and also in which there can be catastrophic injuries from which an individual may not have recovered sufficiently after two years to contemplate bringing proceedings. It is one area that seems not to be dealt with by the changes the Minister has introduced. Many of us agree that the change from three years to two is probably a good compromise in trying to strike a balance between the time limit sought by the insurance industry and the current time limit of three years. The insurance industry would prefer that there was a time limit of one year for everything while the legal profession would prefer a time limit of two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">There are arguments on all sides. Obviously, we should not have cases being dragged out forever — this is more expensive and takes up time. Cases should be dealt with as quickly as possible which is the intention of the legislation. However, there are instances of negligence in which there are complex medical issues involved. It is not the same as an ordinary workplace accident, for example. If one falls in the workplace and is taken to hospital straightaway, the timescale is very short in terms of initiating a case. However, for cases with clinical implications one could find oneself unable even to begin the process of initiating procedures. The medical fall-out from an injury might not even be known for a period of time. In such a case it would be reasonable to revert to the current provisions, with the Statute of Limitations continuing to operate at three years, while in all other instances it should operate on the new timescale of two years. This would probably be the most appropriate course of action. The insurance industry would like to see matters speeded up: in fact it would like to see a time limit of one year in all cases. However, that would be too crude. This degree of flexibility would benefit the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterPowerFF" eId="spk_42">
          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_76">Deputies O'Keeffe and Costello have proposed amendments dealing with the issue of the Statute of Limitations, an aspect of the Bill about which I spoke on Second Stage. I commend the Minister for taking on board the persuasive arguments made by many, not just on the professional side. I commend the Law Society for carrying out its functions as a representative body in a reasoned way. It let the arguments speak for themselves. I refer to the reduction in the time period after which the Statute of Limitations applies from three years to one.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">On Second Stage I asked that the Minister reflect on all the contributions made in the Chamber. I would be interested to hear the results of this. Subject to his opinion, I am inclined to agree with Deputy O'Keeffe's general assertion that medical negligence claims constitute a special category of claims. In ordinary claims one knows almost immediately that there has been an accident, who the prospective defendant is and the nature and type of injury sustained. However, medical negligence claims cannot be easily distinguished on these three grounds. In such cases it cannot always be determined immediately that there was negligence. If there is a car crash, everybody knows instantly that there has been an event from which a negligence case may arise and who caused the negligence immediately or within a short time. One also knows quickly that there is an injury and its extent. However, because of the nature of medical negligence incidents the claimant does not know straightaway that he or she has suffered an injury, does not know who caused it and the extent of the injury. If we accept Deputy O'Keeffe's general assertion that these claims constitute a separate category, we must consider what rules should apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">We should consider extending the limitation period or, if we do not extend it by the arbitrary time of a year, or 400 or 500 days, should we not consider devising some mechanism to address any injustice caused by the alteration of the limitation periods, or the defined period of limitation in cases of medical negligence? If that causes injustice in certain cases, there should be some mechanism to redress it.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">On Second Stage I suggested that the Judiciary be granted some discretion to permit a separate case to be brought, apart from the main action for negligence, which can deal with the Statute of Limitations alone. Medical negligence cases can be complex and long, with expert witnesses on all sides and counsel arguing fine points of law, for example, on causation, and whether, if there was negligence, it caused subsequent serious injury. Those actions can run for many weeks. The time periods in issues of justice can cause injustice. Justice is the issue we should address.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I know of a case which is not yet resolved involving a 43 year old male in Limerick who has been badly damaged through the alleged negligence of a practitioner. His spleen was removed when he was 12 years of age, but in those days when people came out of hospital, they put up with their lot. That attitude does not prevail today. For the past ten years this man's health has deteriorated seriously. When his medical history was examined the question arose of what happened and, over the course of examination, it emerged that removing his spleen may have been the wrong thing to do at the time. Medical opinion suggested in a general way that the man's serious health difficulties might have begun 30 years ago. Now he is on notice that this could have been caused by negligence and the clock started to tick just over three years ago because the Statute has expired in his case. He has no idea who to sue. He does not know what surgeon performed the operation or who advised that his spleen be removed because that might have been a different person. Many of the people are retired and the records in the hospital are almost non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">This is a difficult case and we all know the mantra that hard cases make bad law. If the law as proposed here had been enacted over a year ago, the man would have no cause of action. Do we need to cater in some other way without reference to time for such special cases of real injustice involving no fault on the part of the claimant or the plaintiff?</p>

          <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_82">This section is quite controversial. I met the Tipperary solicitors' association to hear its concerns about some aspects of the Bill. I welcome the compromise initiated by the Minister when the Bill was in the Seanad. It would not have worked with the original one year deadline where there was a five car pile-up and records of injuries had to be obtained and the various solicitors dealt with. In medical negligence cases it is difficult to access hospital records, and medical reports on the alleged negligence of an Irish practitioner must be supported by reports from an English practitioner. Communication is difficult and two years is the minimum time in which this can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">I support Deputy Power's proposal because otherwise people would have no option but to beat the deadline and would be involved in cases when it was not necessary. While we seek real justice for those who have been offended we must ensure that fair justice is provided. I welcome the Minister's comments. One can see the concerns that exist and we know that the time limit is three years. I am pleased that the Minister has changed the provision to two years and not one year as was originally proposed.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_44">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_84">I read the submission from the Law Society on this amendment. I agree with the paragraph which encapsulates the problem to the effect that in serious and complex cases, it may not be feasible to get expert reports within two years of the incident occurring. This could place a solicitor in the invidious position of having to issue proceedings to protect client interest but possibly in a way that runs counter to judicial views of best practice. To guarantee or respect the rights of his or her client, a solicitor would have to lodge proceedings and may be too early, especially in medical circumstances. One needs only look at the developing cases against Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda to see that extra time is required for them. In England there are separate rules for medical negligence claims but I do not know what the Statute of Limitations is on those cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">If a person awaiting the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions on whether to initiate criminal proceedings wanted to pursue a civil claim for personal injuries, for example, in a rape or assault case, and the DPP decided not to proceed, would the time within which the civil proceedings could be entered into be considered to have lapsed or would it be measured from the date of the DPP's decision? A problem arises if the DPP does not announce that a finding has been made.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_45" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_86">When the Bill was introduced in the Seanad, the one year limitation period proposed by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was considered too severe. In the course of the Seanad debate, the question of medical negligence was used as a battering ram to move me away from the one year proposal. The more I considered it, the more certain I was that the arguments were correct that it would be wrong to confine medical negligence cases to one year. I was subsequently confronted with introducing a differential statutory period for medical negligence and other cases involving health service provision. This area does not just cover medical negligence but other issues such as non-treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">From my experience as a legal practitioner, even if the statutory limitation period were 36 months, lawyers would still find themselves under the same pressures as under 18 months. Any cut-off point in complex litigation is always difficult to deal with due to possible difficulties in assembling a case. Many practitioners have been sued for missing the three-year period deadline because of being unable to get on top of the complexity of the case or identify the proper parties to sue.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The law in this area was liberalised only recently. I remember the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy's lectures where he preached and inveighed against the injustice of the law as it used to be; that one could lose one's right of action before one knew one had it. The law was changed to provide that the date of knowledge or the date of accrual, which ever was later, is the date from which the clock starts ticking. In medical negligence cases, it is not merely a matter of sympathy where one went into hospital, had an operation, felt dreadful for six months and knew the name of the surgeon. That does not set the clock ticking in a medical negligence suit. It is the point at which, with reasonable care, one became aware that what was done was medically negligent. There is an added ingredient that one must have knowledge that there was a departure from the standard of care that was owed. The law is objective and is not entirely subjective. A claim cannot be made ten years later because the person did not realise their grounds for action. The law now is objective in that a responsible person taking reasonable steps in the circumstances to ascertain the facts would have come to the conclusion that they had a cause for action. That is the new test.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Do we amend the law again to divide personal injuries actions into two categories? Do we have a separate category for medical negligence, using Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's wider term, arising out of the provision of any health service to a person, a medical or surgical procedure or the provision of medical advice or treatment to a person? I reflected carefully on this and it is not as easy as members might think. Frequently a single incident has several consequences. For example, where a person is knocked down and breaks a limb, he or she is brought to hospital and treated, either correctly or not. It may happen some months after the injuries have settled that he or she should have been warned that the bone had settled in the wrong position, that there should have been an X-ray follow-up and, had he or she been properly advised, a new treatment to mitigate the effects of the accident should have been given. There is a series of single incidents that lead to a multiplicity of claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">I am concerned that, if the two year limit were to be imposed but it would be extended to three years where an additional claim for medical negligence would be made, a claimant would be tempted to allege that he was badly treated. In turn, he would launch a joint action against the original motorist and the doctor, claiming that between them his injuries resulted in a limp. Mixed claims would be difficult to disentangle.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Defensive medicine is also damaging to the national interest. Claiming that the boat must be put out for victims of medical negligence because they are a special category ignores that we want doctors to treat people in an effective and efficient way. It is not a public policy aim to encourage medical negligence claims and put them into a wholly different category from ordinary negligence claims. It is never pleasant to be on the receiving end of a professional negligence claim. A doctor, in working out what went wrong, will have to recreate the situation from the patient's treatment notes to determine if care was adequate. On public policy grounds, I am not as sympathetic as most Deputies are to free range for medical negligence plaintiffs. I tend to believe that the pendulum may have swung too far in favour of liability. If one has a case in medical negligence, then bearing in mind the new law and the new time period which starts at the point of knowledge, which is quite generous in its own way, two years should be sufficient for people with claims against doctors to have those claims articulated, put in writing and commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Deputy Power mentioned the case he was familiar with in Limerick involving a person aged 43 now suffering potentially as a consequence of a procedure carried out on him when he was aged 12, which is 31 years ago. The Deputy made the point that many of the principal actors are now retired and some could be dead. Without being unduly clinical, so to speak, if the defendant dies, then that is the end of the matter in many cases. If a general practitioner mistreats a person and he or she dies subsequently, that is the end of the matter. It is too late to claim negligence a year after the death. The case is gone. There are all sorts of arbitrary aspects if one introduces arbitrary rules, but the advantage of such rules or definite rules with regard to limitation is that people know clearly when the letter arrives from the opposing side that a cast is statute-barred and cannot proceed any further.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Deputy Power makes the other point, for which I have sympathy, namely, that it would be nice to create a jurisdiction for the court to qualify the absolute periods under the Statute of Limitations where a serious injustice arose. I am not quite clear whether he is proposing that generally or with regard to medical negligence. That would defeat the purpose of a Statute of Limitations because it would mean that people would be sucked into litigation and arguing whether there were special reasons or a special injustice or whatever. If one creates that jurisdiction for the courts to circumvent the strict limits laid down in law, the defendant must argue that case, finance its argument and take on the whole business of going to court to argue the issue. I am not personally convinced that such a jurisdiction, although at one level it sounds attractive, would make for a fairer law in the long term. One must go back to the judicial, legal and claims ethos which we have. If one begins to open loopholes or create fuzzy areas on the edge of law, all our experience to date has been that this has tended to be interpreted constructively, if I can use that phrase, by the courts to aid the plaintiff rather than the defendant. That is something we should bear in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked me with regard to the general issue — I presume it was not medical negligence he was concerned about — whether the fact of a criminal proceeding being instituted or not would affect the Statute of Limitations period. That is irrelevant. If one is assaulted by a bouncer in a pub and the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to prosecute or not, under ordinary law time runs against the plaintiff from the day of the assault. What the gardaí, the DPP or anyone else chooses to do with regard to the assault is irrelevant to the time period.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Regarding the example given by Deputy Power involving a 12 year old and regarding perinatal one year olds who are frequently the subject of medical negligence cases, they have in effect 18 years to make a claim, as I know from many cases in which I was involved. It may be that in a very exceptional case, such as the one noted by Deputy Power, even though the child was presumably under the custody of parents, nobody guessed that something had gone wrong while the child was aged between 12 and 21. The upper applicable age now is 18. In our system the dice are loaded in favour of the plaintiff, particularly juvenile plaintiffs. They normally have a substantial amount of time to decide whether damage has been done to them. Regarding people whose minds have been affected or whose injuries have physically prevented them from putting forward a case for themselves, the clock also stops with regard to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The Statute of Limitations is subject to a common law rule that fraud as used in limitation, which is not the same as fraud used in general law, also applies. That means that, for example, if I as a legal or medical practitioner act negligently and do something to conceal my negligence from the plaintiff such as burning files or destroying records, or if I give misinformation, put the person on the wrong track or do anything which in effect amounts to deception of the patient, or if I in some way cause the person to be deceived or kept in ignorance as to the right of action that person might have against me, then on equitable principles I am not entitled to invoke the Statute of Limitations.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">We then come to the subject matter of the points made on radio today by Patient Focus, namely, whether I should create a second category where three years would remain the limitation period. On reflection, my view is that it would not improve the law and would in mixed cases introduce a serious complication. One would know one had a case against the driver of a car that knocked one down, but one could still be debating whether one had a case against the doctor who did not properly fix plates in one's broken leg, or whatever. As different limitation periods would apply to different parts of the same action, that would only complicate the law. Although I see the force of the arguments, I remain unconvinced that I should divide personal injuries into these two categories. The Law Reform Commission is considering all this as part of its work programme. If it comes to a persuasive view that I should create two categories, I will be happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The best thing to do is to keep the limitation period generally understood among the legal profession as being two years from the accrual of the cause of action or the date of knowledge, liberal as that may be, and that the same period of time applies to personal injuries caused by medical or ordinary negligence. Legal practitioners confronted with medical negligence claims would then know that when a client enters the office, that that is the date they must deal with and not some other date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_99">The issue is fairly clear. The Minister has considered the matter carefully and some of his arguments are quite persuasive if one looks at the issue from the point of view of public policy. Along with some of my colleagues, including Government backbenchers, I am trying to find a balance which is fair and just and will ensure that no injustice will be done to people with genuine claims. The ground rules are fairly clear. We do not want fraudulent claims but we want to ensure that genuine claims are not excluded by what in certain circumstances might amount to an arbitrary time limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">One can argue this both ways. It is fair to point out that even though the Minister is reluctant to divide medical and clinical negligence claims from other personal injuries claims, that division has already been made in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Such claims cannot be brought before it. An unusual consequence of that is that the times are frozen when one goes to the PIAB and therefore added on to the normal limitation time for an ordinary personal injury claim. It is not there for a claim for medical or clinical negligence. We end up with the unusual situation that, in practice, the time limit for those claims, which we all agree are complex and should at least be looked at carefully and separately, is shorter than for any other claim. That is an inverse argument, but it is of some relevance.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">If the Minister has not opened the back door, there is the crack of a window. He has referred to the possibility of the Law Reform Commission producing a new recommendation, and perhaps he has touched on the possible routes ultimately to deal with this. He talks about the court finding in a matter of principle that an injustice has been done for some reason. The reason he quoted was one of fraud. Perhaps that route might be pursued from the point of view of a recommendation from the Law Reform Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">If that crack were widened a little, that might resolve the kinds of concerns we have. However, at the moment, I have to assume that the Minister has weighed up the present situation. He feels that, having gone from one year to two years, that should be the limit prescribed in the Bill. As going over the course again will not change his mind, I propose to put my amendment to a voice vote.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_103">The Minister has gone into detail explaining his position. I have some sympathy with the desire not to create a second category of medical negligence. It is not necessarily along those lines that we will be looking. Medical negligence happens to be the form of personal injury with the greatest complexity and it is quoted more often. However, I see that there would be a problem in creating a separate category of medical negligence. My concern is more regarding the significance of the complexity of the injuries and that that would incapacitate a person from acting within the two-year period. Knowledge is one thing, but capacity is another. I am not sure how the Minister can respond to that if someone were so significantly affected by whatever injury he or she had received that it limited the capacity to act and institute proceedings. The term "accruing from the date of knowledge" is not very helpful in such a situation, since knowledge is not much use to a person who does not have the physical capacity to begin the process. My amendment specifically refers to that to ensure that a patient would have recovered sufficiently to have the capacity to begin the process rather than just the knowledge of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">All the information supplied to us by the Law Society and other legal bodies and patients' groups interested in this matter, as distinct from the insurance companies, has referred not to four or five years but three. What problems have been experienced in the existing situation? Are there statistics indicating that one could make a case that there are some severe problems that have been affected by the existing statute of limitations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_48">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_105">The guarantee of the highest standard of medicine and medical care is not served by our cutting the limit for medical negligence cases under the statute of limitations to two years. We should retain the current figure. The Minister spoke of slipshod and low standards of medicine. The way of guaranteeing improvement is to leave the figure at the current level so that the medical profession knows that it is open to such claims. It should also know that any fraudulent or wrongful claims will be rigorously fought and defended on its behalf. That needs to be done and this legislation is intended to tackle some of that claim culture and the fraudulent claims that have been made and have tied up the court system. That aspect is to be welcomed, but it should not be to the detriment of patients who would hope, after they discover that something is wrong, sometimes two or three years down the road, that they would not be left out because they have not managed to get their act together. They will have been too worried trying to sort out medically whatever the problem is without having recourse to the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The other point I raised was that, once the incident occurs, the clock is ticking. Most people would prefer to see the State deal with wrongdoing. The problem I see if one cuts back the statute of limitations to two years is that some of the cases will not have been completed within that period because of delays in the courts. If one depends on the DPP, it can sometimes take six months or a year for a decision to be made and court proceedings to start. By cutting back the limit to two years, one will end up with solicitors advising clients who have been assaulted, raped or whatever not to depend solely on the State to take the case but also to initiate civil proceedings against the individual to cover both ends. We will end up with two cases running concurrently, with civil and criminal proceedings, thereby adding to the workload. I do not know how that could be done, but while criminal action is being considered, the statute of limitations period should be suspended until a determination has been made, whether by the court or the DPP, allowing people to initiate civil proceedings if they felt wronged. It is not an action that people take lightly, especially against abusive people in cases of assault.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I will be very concise. Deputy Costello asked about the number of claims that fall into the various categories. The vast majority of claims are commenced within two years, with the exception of those by people such as disabled children, who can bring claims at a more leisurely pace. On Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point, I will take a typical example. Suppose that someone were beaten by a policeman and waited until his trial before commencing proceedings. If the policeman were acquitted, does that change the person's mind about whether he or she should bring a civil claim? Second, if the policeman is convicted, why should the person not have had his or her claim out there all the time, moving along, ready to be brought within the two year period? There is not much interaction between civil and criminal claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Amendment No. 11 is to remove the phrase "a cause of action accrued" and substitute "the relevant date in respect of a cause of action falls". The purpose of this amendment is to rectify a drafting oversight. The new section 5(<i>a</i>), which it is proposed in section 6(<i>d</i>) to insert in the Statute of Limitations Act 1991 begins with the phrase “where a cause of action accrued”, that means where the incident complained of happened. The limitation period runs from that date or the date of knowledge, as defined in the 1991 Act, if later. The problem with the phrase used at the beginning of section 5(<i>a</i>) at the moment is a cause of action may accrue before the commencement of the Bill, but the date of knowledge may be after the commencement. In such cases the section, as it stands, has the effect that the limitation period will be two years after the commencement, irrespective of the date of knowledge. Indeed, the limitation period could expire before the date of knowledge, which would be an unjust and unintended result. This is to liberalise the law and make it fairer.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I am again trying to provide for a little more flexibility by proposing to extend the period of time for issuing the initial letter of claim from two months to three months. Two months is certainly very short and might be unrealistic in a number of cases, particularly where the plaintiff is only recovering from his or her injuries. The problem is that if the timescale is not met penalties will also accrue. Therefore, there is encouragement for a person to go immediately to his or her lawyer or else face the danger of missing the timescale. It appears that a very tight timescale is demanded. Deputy O'Keeffe is proposing to extend the time to four months, but I am proposing the happy compromise of three months. Perhaps we will settle on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">We are talking here about the requirement to provide information. I am in favour of the proposal in the Bill that information should be provided to the defendant prior to the proceedings. It is only a question of what is reasonable and fair from the point of view of the time limit within which such information should be provided. As Deputy Costello mentioned, certain inferences may be drawn and there is some downside from not proceeding within the time provided in the Bill. I mentioned four months. I accept the view of IBEC, the employers' body, and the insurers that proper notice should be given as soon as possible, particularly as regards workplace accidents where the evidence might not be available even after a reasonable passage of time. Therefore I am in favour of the requirement to have a letter of claim. I would have preferred "as soon as practicable", but I suppose that is somewhat woolly and loose. Again, my concern is to get a fair, balanced approach. If the Minister was prepared to accept Deputy Costello's three month limit, I would be prepared to withdraw my amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_146">Whereas I see some force to the argument for a longer period, the purpose of this is to give the defendant a chance to realise that he or she is being sued and to go out and inspect the <i>locus in quo</i>, the scene of the event and the machine, to get the witnesses and begin to put together the argument for the defence. Two months is provided here, but if someone serves the notice after three months, the court will not deem that wholly inadequate and award costs accordingly or draw adverse inferences where any reasonable excuse is offered for the delay in notifying the other side of the claim. This does not have immediate self-executing effects. It does not mean the case is gone because the letter was not written. It just means that if someone comes into a solicitor and says he or she was injured on such a day, the lawyer does not let a few months go by before notifying the other side. The solicitor has a fairly tight timescale within which he or she is supposed to notify the other side of a claim. Failure to do so would have to be “without reasonable cause” before it has any consequence. The consequence then would be for inference to be drawn from such failure as appears proper. There might be no inference to be drawn, except that the solicitor went golfing instead of sending the letter. Alternatively, where the interests of justice so require, there should be a diminution or disallowance of costs. When the Judiciary starts to disallow costs on the basis that this is so required in the interests of justice, it will be a fairly serious case.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">The Minister stated that he tabled his amendment in the interests of the defendant, whereas both my amendments are in the interests of the plaintiff. The Minister is apparently punishing the plaintiff unduly. In the first instance, the Minister is limiting the time in which he or she may put forward a claim, irrespective of the impediments and obstacles present, and the person has only two months to do that. Should the plaintiff fail to make the claim within the timescale or at all, he or she may lose the costs because of the deductions made from them. That is unrealistic. There should be a compromise where the plaintiff would be at risk of losing additional costs incurred as a result of the late service of the notice or claim. It seems far too harsh to "make no order as to the payment of costs to the plaintiff," as the plaintiff could lose out entirely if he or she does not meet the time schedule. I think the Minister takes some cognisance of that in amendment No. 21. As it stands, the penalty for the plaintiff who does not meet the time schedule as laid out in the section is very harsh, and I propose a compromise that mellows the provision in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">I do not like being cast as a person who is very harsh, because what this is about is in the main casting on legal advisers a duty to make an early notification to the defendant that something is happening. The alternative is that we have a two-year Statute of Limitations period and 18 months after an accident takes place, the defendant hears about it for the first time. That is an indefensible way to proceed. I believe the best way is to deal with it on the question of costs. It is not a deduction from the damages but a deduction from costs. It is saying effectively to lawyers who are involved in personal injuries litigation to get in the notice quickly because a judge may disapprove of the failure to serve a notice in good time and may hit the lawyer personally in his pocket when it comes to recovering costs in a claim. I believe that as between the defendant and his or her solicitor, if the fault lies with the solicitor, he or she would not be in a position to recover those costs out of the plaintiff's damages. It is giving lawyers an incentive to notify the defendant that he or she is coming after him. I do not think it is unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Let me reiterate, the first line of section 8(1) states that there must be an absence of reasonable cause and only then the court may draw inferences from the failure as appears proper or where the interests of justice so require, which is a very high standard, penalise the plaintiff in relation to costs. It must be required in the interests of justice, in other words, if without any excuse whatsoever one allowed 18 months to elapse and if one replied, "It slipped my mind" when asked by the judge after the case finished why it took a period of 18 months before one notified the defendant of the case, one should know that one will not walk away from the litigation as if one had carried out one's functions properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">I can see what will happen to lawyers. The normal practice as of now is that in a straightforward case when one knows to whom the letter is to be sent, the letter is sent straight away. Two situations can arise, first, when it is not clear to whom the letter should be sent and there may be complications. I presume that will be taken into account by the court. The other situation that could arise is that the claimant might not arrive into the solicitor's office for four or five months after the accident for a variety of reasons, because of their injuries or the special relationship with an employer, for example and he or she did not initially want to raise a claim against the employer. It is clear enough from the Bill that the lawyer will have a responsibility once he is instructed to follow the procedure and I have no doubt that will happen in most cases, if the lawyer does not want to put himself in the firing line for misconduct or negligence. What is the situation when the claimant has not instructed his lawyer, as he will not know the law, yet everybody is supposed to know the law? Will he find himself in a position where he could be penalised, perhaps unfairly?.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_174">"(3) Where a plaintiff or proposed plaintiff serves a letter of claim on a defendant or proposed defendant, the defendant or proposed defendant shall, not later than two months after service of the letter of claim, serve a letter of response setting out whether the defendant or proposed defendant accepts that a wrong has been committed by him or her.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">This is tit for tat. If we are to put such a harsh deterrent on the plaintiff, likewise the same deterrent should be imposed on the defendant. If the plaintiff has two months to issue the initial letter of claim, the defendant should have two months to respond. I see nothing untoward about this. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. It would be appropriate if the legislation reflected that. If the purpose of the legislation is to expedite the business of the courts and if we are to put an onus on the plaintiffs to initiate their claim as quickly as possible, we should put a similar onus on the defendant to ensure that he or she responds in an equally quick period of time. I am happy to accept the two sections as long as my amendment is reflected in the responsibility of the defendants.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_180">I do not accept this. The purpose of the letter of claim procedure is to put the defendant on notice, as speedily as possible, that a problem has arisen that may in due course result in legal proceedings being taken against him or her. This is not a case of symmetry between the two partners. One party knows what the score is and has the onus of proof. The other party is the defendant and it is necessary to give that person some degree of notice of what is happening. It is necessary to provide for a prompt notification of the incident in question unless there is some reasonable cause that cannot happen. It does not follow that there must be a corresponding step on the part of the defendant. There is no point in such a step as no action has been launched against the defendant.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The defendant has not got a claim, which could have been referred to the PIAB. Why should the defendant be expected to admit or deny liability at that point? There is a danger of creating a false symmetry at that stage. I accept that it would be desirable that where a defendant knew full well that he or she was liable, he or she should admit it. For instance, the employer has an insurance policy and when a letter of claim comes in it is not dealt with on the managing director's desk. It goes off to the defendant's solicitors. The defendant's solicitors notify the defendant's insurers. The defendant's insurers look at the facts in the letter and decide whether they are liable, if they know the facts, and whether they can make a concession at this stage. The usual point is that the defendant does not know as much about the claim as the plaintiff and is certainly not going to admit liability promptly, unless the insurer tells the defendant that it is an open and shut case that needs to be settled straightaway. I know of one company which employs retired gardaí to settle cases quickly with cheque books because it is more effective to spend money in this way than spending it on lawyers.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">The proposal by Deputy Costello is one that I do not favour completely. At the same time, he has raised an issue that should be recorded. When we talk about a compensation culture, we have a tendency to look at the development of fraudulent claims. We look at the laws, the delays and the accumulation of costs. We forget at times that a contribution to the costs in these matters can arise from the actions of the insurance companies. When I was engaged in active practice, I found that insurance companies seemed to contribute to the accumulation of costs and expenses. They often fought ridiculous claims for open and shut cases and I could not understand why. They often delayed constructively dealing with claims until the last minute at the door of the court, when all the costs were incurred. I understand that there has been a change of approach on their part to some degree, although not to the extent where they have been sending out a cheque book after each accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The thinking behind Deputy Costello's amendment is to raise the issue that the problems with personal injury claims and associated costs can often be laid at the door of insurance companies. They have a case to answer as well. It might be going overboard to require them to serve a letter admitting liability or otherwise within two months, yet in the development of our thinking on civil liability, we should be thinking of what obligations, if any, should be put on insurance companies to have a more cost effective system.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">Deputy O'Keeffe has argued the case very well. I want to ensure that we get a balance in the legislation. The onus is always on the plaintiff. Right through this Bill, Seán Citizen is the poor devil who is being hammered as there is a presumption that the person instigating a claim is abusing the system and is at fault all along. I want to ensure in this legislation that there are other parties involved in the process. One of the parties involved is the insurance industry and another is the legal advisers. All these parties have a role to play and have responsibilities. We are imposing onerous responsibility down the line on the plaintiff, as though in some way he or she is responsible for all ills of the system. We are not imposing similar responsibilities on the defendant and the insurance industry to make sure that they respond in a meaningful fashion. That is the intent of what I am putting here. I want to ensure that the defendants come to grips with the issue at the earliest possible moment. It may not be encompassed and I heard what the Minister said about the difficulties. We need to ensure, however, that the response is forthcoming expeditiously and meaningfully. The legislation should reflect that.</p>

We specify a time limit for the defendant to respond, which is to some extent to get the balance right.

          <p eId="para_225">I do not propose to accept the amendment. There is provision in the present rules of court for particulars arising out of any pleading to be served on a party who has served that pleading. A defendant is obliged to provide particulars of any substantive matters raised in the defence. Sometimes, the plaintiff may require information from a defendant such as on their earnings. This is normally dealt with by letter and the court would expect the defendant to provide that information. I do not propose to accept the amendment as it is unnecessary and puts too much into statute form.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">This is another example of the principle that what is good for the goose is not good for the gander. In other words, all this information must be provided to the plaintiff. The whole section contains all sorts of detail about the plaintiff's circumstances whereas there is no requirement that similar information be provided for the defendant. There may well be circumstances where the manner in which an employer has operated his or her employment would be valuable and relevant. There should be a balance in regard to the particulars to be supplied. That the plaintiff has to provide personal and occupational details while the defendant does not, even though the defendant may have been the employer of the plaintiff for a considerable period, would not appear to be the best way of proceeding.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I am not accepting this amendment because such particulars can be sought under existing rules of court. It is difficult for a defendant to particularise a claim that the plaintiff was negligent. The defendant is not present frequently when the incident takes place, does not see what happened and does not know precisely why the employee was negligent. He has to infer it from the circumstances. Where somebody puts his or her hand into a machine, precisely why that person put his or her hand into a machine when nobody was looking is something the defendant rarely knows about. The defendant will allege contributory negligence from that fact alone, that he has put his hand into the machine. He cannot specify precisely what led to that. I said I would consider this matter further in the Seanad, and having considered it further I still believe it is better to leave it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">These are administrative amendments. The effect of amendment No. 27 would be to delete subsections (3), (4) and (5). The requirement in each subsection is to lodge pleadings in the relevant court offices after they are served. The case has been made to me that this will lead to unnecessary, unjustifiable expense, which we are trying to avoid, for both plaintiffs and defendants. This was the system in the old days as I recollect from my practice when I started off. The system changed in the meantime. As I understand it, the current situation is that one lodges the book of pleadings only when the case has been set down to trial. I do not know what is the justification for providing in statute that we revert to the old system. It appears to be an unnecessary expense. I gather that it would give rise to administrative difficulties also for the Courts Service. It was on that basis I tabled the amendments. If there is a particular reason for it I am prepared to listen to it but if not I ask the Minister to accept it?</p>

The grammar is a little askance and perhaps the Minister will examine it.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">No, this is a fairly important amendment. A mediation conference would be an excellent way of resolving a dispute, if that could be done without the need for all the other procedures, costs and so on. If the chairperson can put anything he or she wants in the report and given the Minister proposes the wording that the report shall include the following, that means that it could include many other matters. Many personal, private and angry scenes may take place in the course of a procedure, but there is no need to report the detail of everything that takes place. What needs to be reported is the relevant matters, namely, where a mediation conference did not take place, a statement of the reasons it did not take place, where a mediation conference did take place, a statement as to whether a settlement was reached in the personal injuries action, or where a settlement has been entered into, a statement of the terms of the settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">What is the value of giving a blow by blow account of what did or did not transpire in a mediation conference? Only the results of the proceedings of the conference need to be given. If the chairperson prepares a long drawn-out report about who said this and who said that, and attaches blame on one side or the other, that will be of no advantage. We need to be specific about what the chairperson will be required to put in the report rather than leaving it open to his or her discretion.</p>

It will not be secret and will be handed to the court. This is a derogation from the general rule that procedures that happen with a view to settling a case are covered by the without prejudice rule, which is a privilege that such material cannot be used in court afterwards. If two barristers or two solicitors are outside a courthouse and one of the solicitors or barristers says that his or her client looks guilty but there is A, B and C, the other solicitor or barrister cannot run into court and take an oath on the bible and say that the other solicitor or barrister half admitted that outside and said that he or she would give me €40,000. There is a rule against admitting such material. It is a form of privilege that without prejudice negotiations are not admissible in evidence. The general rule is that without prejudice material is not admissible. Therefore, only that which is made admissible is covered by the procedure.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_344">I wish to raise some concerns about section 16 generally. Normally in dealing with a claim, one expects the defendant or the defendant's insurers to make an offer. If they do not, in many cases they should. Here, however, we are also requiring the plaintiff to serve notice in writing of an offer of terms of settlement. Has this been thought through? Is it fair to the plaintiff? Normally, the plaintiff makes a claim. It is then up to the defendant to declare that the plaintiff does not have a claim, to tell him or her to go to the Devil, to defend or otherwise state the claim is worth a certain amount. The initiative is taken by the defendant and the plaintiff may or may not make a counter offer once negotiations start. I wonder if the Minister has thought through what will happen and when this procedure will be initiated. As he well knows, haggling often occurs in the round hall of the Four Courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I have indicated that I intend to substitute the word "formal" for "final" in a Report Stage amendment. I will not try to prevent haggling on the steps of the court. I want to introduce a provision — this is not a novel concept or unique to Ireland — whereby both sides in litigation will be told on an objective basis as a precondition prior to trial that they must set out the terms on which they are willing to settle the claim. The idea is that plaintiffs can be forced to act reasonably. They will not be able to state they want €1 million for a broken finger and not a halfpenny less. If this is his or her totally unreasonable attitude, it will be borne in mind at a later stage by the court in deciding on costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">It appears the defendant will not even have to make an offer. According to the section, the defendant may state he or she is not prepared to pay any sum of money to the plaintiff in settlement of the action. Therefore, the plaintiff will have to indicate what offer he or she will accept but the defendant will not have to make any statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">The reasonableness of that attitude is something which the court can take into account at a later stage. If one thought the case was fraudulent, it would be wrong to require a defendant to offer a sum of money to settle the claim. If one intended to blow the plaintiff out of the water, it would be wrong to tell a defendant that, nonetheless, he or she must offer to settle the claim for a sum of money other than zero. That would give the plaintiff an opportunity not to opt for making a fraudulent claim.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I accept the point in regard to fraudulent claims and emphasise that we must do everything we can to stop them. However, I am worried that this approach might run counter to the normal process, that it would give an unfair advantage to the defence in that the plaintiff will have to set out the claim in detail, that there may be a contest on liability. Therefore, there may be two issues to be resolved. Without an offer from the defendant, the plaintiff will have to state a minimum figure. I am not sure that this is a constructive approach. If it was a Circuit Court claim, the minimum would be €38,000 or whatever the limit was at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I would like to see the process reversed. I have no problem once the defence has indicated its position. Otherwise, we are imposing a requirement on the plaintiff to state whether he or she will settle for something close to the offer, or that it is one million miles away, in which case this could subsequently be used against him or her. It is wholly unfair to the plaintiff to have to nominate the first figure in the settlement stakes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_362">Because it will be mandatory on the plaintiff to nominate the figure, the problem is that it will be a ballpark figure which will bear little relation to the final settlement. Therefore, is it of any value to make it mandatory in such circumstances? As Deputy O'Keeffe said, it reverses the normal procedure whereby the defendant indicates settlement terms first and then the plaintiff responds.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">All of which will happen in any event. This provision requires a formal exchange of offers. It is highly unlikely that a case will get to this point without intensive efforts having been made. There could well be mediation. There is nothing in the provision which states the normal procedure, whereby the defendant will offer, say, €50,000 and horse trading will ensue, will not take place. This is a different system whereby the two parties will be required, as a pre-condition prior to trial at a late stage in the proceedings, to state the terms on which the plaintiff is willing to settle.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">No, I will provide for a scenario whereby final offers have not been exchanged. If the case is about to be taken and a final effort takes place at the door of the court to settle or it is settled a day and a half into proceedings, I do not want to prevent people from varying their offers to each other. However, as a precondition for setting a case for trial, both sides must address independently of the other what are the terms on which they will settle the case. For example, if a plaintiff is willing to take €30,000, under Deputy O'Keeffe's hypothesis, the defendant must outline what he is willing to offer before the plaintiff does that.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_399">"(<i>a</i>) the name and address of the solicitor for each party to a personal injuries action,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">It is strange that a section has been inserted under which the name, occupation and address of each party to a personal injury action must be identified without referring to the solicitors involved in cases. I propose that the names of the solicitors for each party should be provided. It refers to the same principle that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Personal injury claims do not take place in a total vacuum and the presumption that Seán and Mary citizen are entirely to blame for abuse in such cases should not be dealt with as lightly as this. The presumption inherent in the section is that there is something questionable about their behaviour and they will be shamed by having to register their names, addresses and occupations. If that is the case, the names of solicitors should also be provided. I have reservations about establishing a register for such private and confidential information, which can be viewed by all comers on the Internet. People may talk about it in chatrooms. It is a dangerous road to go down. I do not like the presumption inherent in the section.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">There are a number of inter-related issues. Rather than waste time, I shall refer to just one.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I have no problem with amendment No. 40 which reads: "The name and address of the solicitor for each party...". I am worried about having a register available on the Internet which, as Deputy Costello mentioned, could be open to misinterpretation. Perhaps the Minister will explain the rationale behind the section, thus allowing us to re-examine the matter. It appears to highlight the fact that someone is taking an action, or perhaps it is an action being taken against people for not paying their taxes which indicates they are being named and shamed or, alternatively, involved in a questionable activity. That is what worries me. Possibly, the approach adopted by Deputy Costello would be a neat solution. I worry that the register may be misused. That is the reason I oppose the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">An earlier section allows an insurance company to serve a notice requiring information. Perhaps it could legitimately check the register to see if a claimant had previously been involved in an accident. A register should be available to those who have a legitimate reason to use it rather than purely from the point of view of public curiosity. I shall listen to the Minister's response with interest. Deputy Costello's suggested approach is a good one.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">I do not understand the need for a register. Why is there a requirement to place it on the Internet? Imagine the amount of spam that would be sent to someone whose name, occupation and address was published on the Internet. Every legal firm in the world would promote its services and claim it could represent a person better the next time he or she took a case.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Obviously, there are certain occupations that are more dangerous than others. Some have lodged several claims. Perhaps the Courts Service could maintain a register to find out which occupation has had most claims lodged against it. Perhaps the Health and Safety Authority could also ensure the courts were not tied up with personal injury actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I hope other aspects of the legislation will prevent fraudulent and mischievous claims. However, I am concerned about the public nature of the register.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I do not propose to accept the amendment, even though I am aware of the arguments made by the Law Society of Ireland and Opposition Deputies. First, I do not believe the section could be used to breach legal professional privilege. It must be given a constitutional construction like every other section of a Bill or Act. I do not believe it could be interpreted to mean privileged matters would be discovered by reference to a direction by the board. Therefore, paragraph <i>(b)</i> of the amendment is already implicit and constitutionally mandated.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I am not happy about paragraph <i>(a)</i> which is cast too wide. If I went into Deputy O’Keeffe’s solicitors’ practice, he would be obliged to keep every last scrap of paper confidential unless there was a reason for doing otherwise. The PIAB needs to know what pleadings have or have not been exchanged between parties. It may want to get records in order to compile its book of quantum. I need to think about this aspect because it is not directed at solicitors.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">Yes, that is the point. As currently framed, it could catch solicitors within its net. The whole principle of confidentiality between solicitor and client has been a foundation stone of legal practice for hundreds of years, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Many claim it is a fundamental right under the Constitution. In that context, I would be worried about agreeing to any change in the law which could infringe on this aspect. I would be happy if the Minister re-examined the matter because it is a serious issue.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_484">‘general cash account' means the general cash account of the funds of suitors held with the financial institution in the name of the Accountant;".</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The purpose of the amendment is a new definition for the type of financial institutions which might hold the accounts of the Courts Service. This is essentially to allow the Courts Service greater flexibility in deciding which financial institutions might handle its accounts. Up to now, the Bank of Ireland has always held the account. That bank has been specifically mentioned in previous funds of suitors and in the Bill as passed by the Seanad. There is no animus or complaint against the Bank of Ireland. It is simply prudent to provide this freedom of choice to the Courts Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The second new definition concerns the indemnity to be offered should any loss occur to anyone who holds a dormant account. The proposed definition follows further consultation with the Courts Service and is designed to provide for the first time an explicit definition as to the nature and extent of the indemnity. A third new definition under the proposed amendment relates to the general cash account. It is essentially a drafting point which complements the other proposed changes.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_489">In page 22, lines 19 to 23, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_490">"(1) The Chief Justice shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Chapter, order the Accountant to realise all of the investments of the dormant account of the funds of suitors of the High Court.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_491">(2) The Chief Justice shall, not later than 3 months after—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_492">(a) the expiration of 5 years from the making of an order under subsection (1), and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_493">(b) the expiration of each subsequent period of 5 years from the date on which an order under this section is made,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_494">order the Accountant to realise all of the investments of the dormant account of the funds of suitors of the High Court.".</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The proposed new subsections (1) and (2) revise and clarify the previous provision with the regard to the Chief Justice giving an order to the accountant. The reference is now "as soon as may be after the commencement of this Chapter". It is a drafting point. The previous references in subsection (1) as passed by the Seanad to small accounts balances held solely in cash and to the non-realisation of 2.5% of the dormant funds are deleted. This section now deals only with the realisation of non-cash dormant investments. The proposed subsection (2) is a provision to permit for the future realisation of dormant investments on each fifth anniversary of the passing of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">On amendment No. 48, the general objective of that section remains the same. This provides for the transfer of dormant funds of suitors to the Exchequer with the proviso that they can be used for the benefit of the courts projects. On Committee Stage of the Bill, some Deputies highlighted this as a form of ringfencing. I want to make it clear that these dormant funds are a special case.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The previous Funds of Suitors Act, in allocating funds to certain specified cultural and legal projects, could be considered a form of ring-fencing. This Bill continues that approach but provides now that it should be used for court related projects, all likely to benefit those who need to use such facilities that will receive the funds. The Minister for Finance is agreeable that these funds can be seen as extra for that specific purpose. If he is willing to see it that way then I must do so. I am sure that Deputies will be able to put forward many suggestions to the Courts Service as to what should be done with those moneys. Nonetheless, it is a court function.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The previous reference to the Bank of Ireland, in this section, has been deleted for the reasons that I explained earlier. The proposed provision is that the Chief Justice can direct, from time to time, the amount of the dormant funds to be paid to the Exchequer, as not exceeding 97.5% of the aggregate of the moneys available, effectively providing for a small reserve and for a rolling mechanism to enable the future disposal of all realised dormant funds without recourse to new legislation. This complements the amendment under section 32 providing for the realisation, in the future, of non-cash dormant investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">With regard to amendment No. 49, the revision of the original section as passed by the Seanad is minimal and essentially of a drafting nature. As has been previously noted, the reference to the Bank of Ireland has been removed and replaced with a generic reference to the financial institution. The reference to the indemnity to be offered to suitors in the unlikely event that funds are not available to meet claims for repayment is shortened. The committee will recall that I proposed to include a definition of indemnity in the definitions section.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">On amendment No. 50, the proposed inclusion of a new section requiring the Courts Service to make a public notification of the transfer of dormant funds to the Exchequer is consistent with the provisions of the dormant assets legislation already enacted, the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003. The four previous Funds of Suitors Acts did not include such a provision. Thus subsection (1) of the new section 35 provides that within three months of the transfer of the value of the dormant funds to the Exchequer the accountant shall make a public notification to that effect in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, in newspapers circulated within the State, the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> or by any other means considered appropriate. The notification procedure will facilitate suitors to make legitimate claims for repayment. The public notification procedure for any subsequent transfers of dormant funds to the Exchequer is made conditional that the amount exceeds €100,000. This is a sensible approach as it might only concern small sums and the expense involved would not be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">In subsection (2) the accountant is required to make all reasonable efforts to write to persons with an entitlement to their own funds informing them of its transfer to the Exchequer. In reality, this is unlikely to impose a great burden on the Courts Service as due details are available for most of the dormant account holders. In subsection (3) it is provided that the expenses involved in public notification can be paid from the remaining funds not paid over to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">On amendment No. 51, the new section 36 provides that the accountant should keep a register of the key details with regard to dormant account holders. The proposed new section requiring the Courts Service to keep a register of dormant fund holders is consistent with the reform of the accounting procedures in the courts and the provisions of the dormant assets legislation already referred to. Again, the four previous Funds of Suitors Act did not include a provision for such a register.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_503">This looks to be a matter of accounting. The technical details seem to be in order. Again, it raises the question of ring-fencing. When the Minister persuaded the Minister for Finance to agree that it was extra funding, did he also make any progress on the proceeds of crime legislation? We sought to have the latter ring-fenced in the same way because it was not mainstream funding for the Exchequer. Instead it was additional and came from the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is very desirable to use the windfall funds for the Courts Service's building projects that might not otherwise have been undertaken. I hope the Minister will continue with the precedent that has now been clearly established.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_510">The purpose of the 97.5% is because experience has shown that it is unlikely that a claim will be made on the dormant accounts. We want to maximise the use of the moneys. Everybody is covered by an indemnity. Effectively, I could pitch it at 90% or lower but experience has shown that 97% should be enough. Nonetheless, there will continue to be a small amount of moneys called the dormant account. There will always be a continuous process to be triggered every five years to disburse the account.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">This amendment seeks the deletion of paragraph <i>(a)</i> of section 37. There appears to be something of an injustice here which prevents interest on costs, charges or expenses being awarded to a party or payable until the entire proceedings and the taxation process are complete. This would make it possible to drag out the procedure for a long time which is a concern also expressed by the Law Society. The concern is that if the provision was enacted, the defendants would have no incentive whatsoever to encourage the taxation process which could be dragged out over a considerable period of time. It also seems to be a serious injustice to the plaintiff that none of the interest on costs, charges or expenses would be available until the end of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">This amendment seeks to delete that section. I do not see why it should be there. It would be preferable to leave it out, especially since the Minister has been arguing that the thrust of this legislation is to expedite the business of dealing with personal injuries claims and cut down on costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I am surprised Deputy Costello has accepted the Law Society's view. That society is a wonderful institution, but on this occasion it is wrong. Currently, undetermined liabilities for costs carry interest, even while nobody knows the exact amount payable. It is clearly understood that the amount of a decree carries interest from the date of judgment. However, to give solicitors interest rates of 8%, which is what is involved here, on their costs at a point when they cannot say what their costs will amount to or have not determined them would make a bad situation significantly worse. The Government proposal is that costs should only attract interest when they are quantified and crystallised in a certain amount. That is much fairer than the current unjustified situation which provides quite a bonus, 8%, to solicitors on an undetermined liability for costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">I am not sure I agree with the Minister's reading of it. Section 37 states that interest on the amount of costs and charges shall not be payable, etc. That means that the interest accumulates until it is paid and will not be payable until the amount is agreed by all the parties — a delayed process — or in default of agreement, until a date on which certificate of taxation etc. is provided. Therefore, the payment of interest will, potentially, be dragged out which will create the very problem the provision is intended to prevent. If there is an 8% interest provision——</p>

          <p eId="para_581">The truth is that if costs are awarded to one party, there is a phase during which they can either sit down and agree the costs or one party may bring it to taxation and force the other party to pay at the end of a taxation process. If a person is on the losing side in these cases and must pay costs, taxation is not an attractive option because the taxation costs must also be paid.

The essential new element for the appointment of deputy masters of the High Court is that this can now be done, not only when the master's office is vacant or he is incapacitated, but also when the Courts Service considers it desirable to do so.</p>

We will have a centralised electronic issuance of summonses as part of a routine process and whoever is running the points system will be able to apply for summonses against people who have not paid on the spot fines etc.</p>

The appointment of these additional judges will speed up the hearing of cases in each of the courts concerned and will reduce delays in the delivery of judgments. The additional judicial resources being provided will greatly enhance the capability of the courts to deal with an ever increasing work load, both in terms of civil and criminal business. The provision of additional High Court judges in particular, will, I hope, assist in further reducing delays in the Central Criminal Court which deals with murders and rapes. It will make it possible to expedite trial in the Special Criminal Court and will speed up judicial reviews which are in arrears at present.</p>
