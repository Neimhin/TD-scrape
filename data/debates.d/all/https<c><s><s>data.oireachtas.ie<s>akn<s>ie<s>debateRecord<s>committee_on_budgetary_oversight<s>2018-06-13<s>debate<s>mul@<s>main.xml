          <from> Mr. Seamus Coffey<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">On behalf of the council, I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss our recent fiscal assessment report. As the Chair mentioned, joining me today are Dr. Martina Lawless, Mr. Michael Tutty, Mr. Sebastian Barnes and Dr. Íde Kearney. Members of the council secretariat are also present, namely, Mr. Eddie Casey, our chief economist and head of the secretariat, Ms Kate Ivory and Mr. Niall Conroy. The council’s work is enriched by its interactions with the committee and we continue to value these engagements. We hope we can continue to interact meaningfully with elected representatives and I also wish to acknowledge the ongoing interaction between the secretariat and Oireachtas staff in support of these meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The council published its 14th fiscal assessment report on 5 June. The report covers all aspects of the council’s mandate, as set out in the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 and the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2013, including assessing the Government’s fiscal stance, assessing the Government’s budgetary and macroeconomic forecasts, including the endorsement function, and monitoring compliance with Irish and EU fiscal rules. The council notes that the Irish economy has experienced a rapid cyclical recovery since at least 2014, which is continuing at a strong pace. Estimates suggest that the economy is producing close to its potential in 2018 and will move beyond it next year and thereafter. In the near term, burgeoning pressures in the housing sector could yield a sharper than expected recovery in housing construction. Although the immediate outlook is favourable, negative shocks will inevitably occur in future. There are clear downside risks over the medium term, including Brexit, US trade policy and the international tax environment to name but a few. Recognising this, the council notes a current window of opportunity that should be used to return debt to safer levels and make the economy more resilient to shocks. Ireland’s debt burden is still among the highest in the OECD and the burden is understated by standard gross domestic product, GDP, comparisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The council observes that improvements on the budgetary front have stalled since 2015 despite the strong cyclical recovery reinforced by a number of favourable tailwinds. Although the economy has experienced a strong recovery, that has not translated into any notable improvement in the underlying budget balance, taking into account improvements driven by the cycle. Non-interest spending has risen at essentially the same pace as buoyant cyclical tax revenue since 2015. Allowing for the estimated effects of the cycle, the structural position appears to have deteriorated since 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> It is in that context that the council welcomes the fiscal stance adopted by the Government in the stability programme update, SPU, 2018, but the council notes that the Government should at least stick to its existing budgetary plans for 2019. The council assesses that there is no case for additional fiscal stimulus in 2019 beyond those plans and that anything more expansionary is not likely to be appropriate. In its assessment, the council defines an appropriate policy for next year as one in which spending is increased in line with the sustainable long-term growth rate of the economy. That would imply an approximate limit for spending increases or tax cuts of up to €3.5 billion, that is, the gross fiscal space, as the starting point for any budgetary plans for 2019. The calculation is based on forecast price inflation and potential growth rate estimates for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The council considers a number of estimates of medium-term potential output growth, namely, the Department’s preferred estimates of real potential output growth, which average close to 3% per annum over the forecast period 2019-21, the council’s own estimates of 3.25% and recent estimates produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, of approximately 3.3%. Allowing for inflation, which is forecast to be a little over 1% for 2019, this implies a growth rate of up to 4.5%. Applying this to an adjusted measure of expenditure - the corrected expenditure aggregate in the expenditure benchmark - implies a nominal limit of up to €3.5 billion. The cost of previously announced measures, including sharp increases in public investment, means that the Government’s scope for new initiatives in budget 2019 will be limited. Departmental estimates provided to this committee note that spending pre-commitments of €2.6 billion already have been made for 2019. That is not necessarily the correct estimate to compare against the approximate limit of up to €3.5 billion but it highlights that there is limited scope in the next budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> A point that is often missed is that the objective of the rules is to ensure overall sustainability, not to prevent government spending. Tax policies that increase revenue in a sustainable manner, that is, in a way that can be expected to last over the long run, allow a government to grow spending at a faster pace than the initial limits set by the rules. Similarly, real efficiency gains in public spending that can be sustained allow a government to provide more services.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> It would be desirable for the Government to improve the budget balance by more than planned, especially given the risks of overheating and the opportunity provided by favourable times. Unexpected increases in tax revenues or lower interest costs should not be used to fund further budgetary measures, as has happened in recent years. The window of opportunity should be used to return debt to safer levels and to make the economy and public finances more resilient to shocks. Revenues arising from a faster than expected recovery in housing construction should be used to build buffers either through additional contributions to the rainy day fund or through faster debt reduction. Moreover, spending should not be allowed to continue to drift up as unexpected and likely cyclical or transitory revenues arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Looking forward, the council assesses that the Government needs a credible plan for the medium term. As we show in our report, relying solely on the fiscal rules would not have guaranteed sustainability in the public finances during the 2000s and is not likely to fully mitigate future crises. Focusing on the right budgetary stance and being prepared to be more cautious than the fiscal rules allow is the correct approach for the Government to follow. However, there are a number of challenges and no scope for complacency. There is a danger that the current policy framework is insufficiently equipped to prevent a return to pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Sensible policy tools such as the rainy day fund and a medium-term debt target, which were set up to help with medium-term budgeting, are only half-formed and need more development if they are to be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> There are a number of solutions which should be pursued. The Government should make an explicit commitment to adhere to what it sees as a sensible medium-term path for spending growth net of tax measures. This could be operationalised on the basis of, at a minimum, following the spending rule, also known as the expenditure benchmark, even when that is not formally required. This should be informed by the Department’s own medium-term estimates of potential output growth and of the natural rate of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The proposed design of the rainy day fund should be strengthened. The rainy day fund should be foremost a truly countercyclical fund, one that dampens swings in the cycle and alleviates pro-cyclicality in the rules rather than just allocating fixed contributions regardless of that. A recent IFAC working paper outlines how relatively modest changes in the fiscal rules would help to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> The Government’s forecast horizon should return to five years ahead. The shortening of the horizon in the most recent projections from five to three years ahead is not compatible with the aim of achieving medium-term fiscal stability. For context, budget 2016, released in October 2015, was forecasting as far ahead as 2021, which is the same endpoint as that of current plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">This risks complacency seeping into medium-term planning and future publications should extend the horizon back to a five-year-ahead basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The Government's medium-term debt target, which aims for a debt level of 55% of GDP over an unspecified timeframe, would be better specified if it were clearly time bound, set against a more appropriate denominator than GDP, set as a ceiling rather than as a target, committed to in a credible manner and actually set at a low or prudent level.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> An important area in which the Department has made progress, which the council welcomes, is its publication of alternative estimates of the output gap. Understanding the economic cycle is an essential part of assessing the appropriate fiscal stance. It can help us to understand whether current levels of tax receipts or unemployment benefits are temporarily high or low compared with when the economy is in a steady state. A failure to do so can mean that deteriorations in the underlying budgetary position are not adequately recognised and another painful correction of the public finances might ultimately be required. The economy's potential growth rate is also a critical determinant of how fast taxes will sustainably grow and how sustainable levels of spending and the public debt burden will prove to be. The council believes these alternative measures should feature more prominently in future departmental publications and future endorsements.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I thank the committee for again providing us with the opportunity to attend today. We look forward to taking questions and hearing the views of members.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I will have to leave after I ask my questions as I have a meeting with a Minister to attend. I will return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Is what the Minister proposed for the rainy day fund sufficient? Will it be truly countercyclical or more of a contingency fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> On the macroeconomic risk matrix, the council stated in its report that there is a medium likelihood of overheating in the economy, which would have a medium impact. How important is broadening the tax base in preventing overheating of the economy? What can the Government do to broaden the tax base? Is it fiscally prudent to be looking at tax cuts? Would tax cuts contribute to the possibility of the economy overheating in the next several years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Michael Tutty<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">We certainly support the rainy day fund. However, we have put forward our own proposals as to how it should work and would prefer our methodology to what the Minister has proposed. We would prefer it to be a countercyclical fund rather than just a contingency fund for exceptional circumstances. We would see it working not by putting in a fixed amount every year for a few years and then stopping. Instead, we would base it on growing our expenditure in line with the long-term growth in the economy, while any more space beyond that would be put into the rainy day fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> We should also be looking for mechanisms which will allow the fund to be used in a way that will be in line with the fiscal rules. Currently, the fiscal rules are not designed for a rainy day fund. There need to be tweaks to allow moneys going into the rainy day fund to be classed in some way as expenditure and then not classed as such when they come out the other end.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There are differences between what we see the rainy day fund being and what the Minister and the Department see it as being. We would certainly prefer to see a rainy day fund, even on the Minister's basis, than no such fund. We have let ourselves walk into spending more and more money at various stages in our cycles over the past 20 and 30 years. This is because we think the economy will continue to grow strongly and we keep spending all the money which comes in, as opposed to limiting the expenditure in the good times in order that more is available in the bad times to avoid having cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We have published a paper on our website with our proposals as to how the rainy day fund should work. We would certainly like our proposals to be talked about with the other member states to see a change in the fiscal rules which would allow a rainy day fund to operate properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">One of the reasons that the council and the Government have proposed a rainy day fund is to prevent the economy from overheating in the medium term. Are there any other measures which could be taken to prevent the economy from overheating?</p>

          <p eId="para_42">The real way to prevent overheating is to avoid spending too much or giving too many tax reliefs at a time when the economy is growing strongly. Extra expenditure and extra tax reliefs just add to the demand in the economy, which is what leads to overheating at a time when the economy and employment are growing well and unemployment is falling. Overheating would be avoided by not spending the money and reducing the debt level, as well as by putting money into a rainy day fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The fiscal rules and the overall demand in the economy are not affected if expenditure is financed by extra taxation. It is the balance between the expenditure growth and the tax revenue which determines whether the economy is going to be overheating. It is by expanding expenditure at a fast rate without doing anything on the tax side or without cutting other expenditure. It is the overall level of demand that the Government is introducing into the economy that we should be looking at. That should be more modest when the economy is growing fast and when we are reaching full employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">On overheating, the main emphasis we are trying to bring out in this report is the issue about medium-term sustainability. That is related to broadening the tax base. At the point where the economy is at now, it is important the Government does not add to the stimulus. If there is a tax cut, then there should be a complementary expenditure cut. We do not take a view on taxation versus expenditure in terms of the budgetary measures which are taken. However, it is important that on a position like this, we look at the medium-term sustainability of any measures which are taken and to ensure there is no additional stimulus.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">On the macroeconomic risk matrix, the council referred to corporation tax. It gave the example that if one large foreign direct investment, FDI, company were to leave, the Government's revenues would be reduced by approximately €330 million. What advice would the council give to the Government to ensure that, if that did happen, we would not be left with such a massive hole in our revenues? Given that corporation tax receipts have been so volatile over the past 20-odd years, there seems to be a warning there to the Government about over-relying on corporation tax receipts.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">The purpose of the exercise was to give a stylised example of the potential impacts, were one of the large FDI companies to leave. We focused on those companies that are also large payers of corporation tax. There are foreign companies in Ireland, say, in the retail sector serving the domestic economy, which would have a much larger impact on employment if they left. The exit of one of those is likely to be followed by a replacement. We will need the domestic retail sector to continue to be serviced. However, in the FDI sector there is a possibility for a company to leave and simply not be replaced at all. We wanted to assess what would happen if a sample company within that group were to leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The biggest relative impact would be on corporation tax, given the large payments made by a small group of companies. There would also be an impact on earnings and employment in the economy. Perhaps 4% of corporation tax receipts would leave the country if such a company was to leave, whereas the impact on employment would be approximately 0.1%, representing a much smaller overall impact. </p>
          <p eId="para_49"> In terms of mitigation, we have warned in previous reports that corporation tax receipts are at an elevated level and have almost doubled in the past number of years, particularly in 2015 when it increased by two thirds. Receipts from corporation tax are now close to record levels in terms of contribution to the Exchequer. We feel the economy is going through a strong upward recovery, but public finances have been benefitting from tailwinds, whether through additional corporation tax receipts or lower debt interest costs. These are all contributing to a strong position at present. However, we are warning that we cannot expect that to continue indefinitely. We could face a downturn in the economy for a variety of reasons, or we might experience losses of either revenue or employment in the foreign direct investment, FDI, sector. While the economy is performing strongly now, we should not commit all those resources to permanent increases in spending or tax cuts when we may need to use them in future to offset the impact of some of these potential problems. We should keep some of the benefits in reserve while we are getting them. We would like to have fiscal capacity to deal with an inevitable downturn, whether in the domestic economy or in the international FDI sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The issue with many of the risks we are raising is that the policy advice is the same - some of the resources should be kept in reserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">The risk matrix diagram on page 54 refers to the housing supply pressures. They are deemed to have a high likelihood of having a medium impact on the economy. Can the witnesses expand on the harm this could cause to competitiveness within the economy? There is huge demand for housing, which has to be met.

          <from> Dr. Martina Lawless<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">There is a strong argument in favour of increasing housing activity and supply in the country. The risk we are talking about is primarily that this individual sector is likely to grow strongly - and there are many arguments in favour of such growth - but that it should not distort the overall balance of the economy in the way it did leading up to 2007, where the economy became concentrated and tax revenues became concentrated in revenues from a single sector. Increased activity in the housing sector, once it picks up - we are not saying that it should not pick up - should be counterbalanced by a dampening down in other sectors in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> With regard to immediate risks to competitiveness in the absence of an increase in housing supply, if increases in housing costs, both in house prices and in the rental sector, continue, there will be risks to the overall competitiveness of the economy in that these might feed into price pressures and wage pressures. We have not seen much evidence of wage pressures in the economy, but there is a risk that continued increases in the cost of housing will feed into wage demands and a loss of broader competitiveness. All of this can further reinforce the social argument for increasing housing activity and the building up of housing supply. I emphasise that increasing housing supply and the extra activity taking place in that sector should be offset a little bit by dampening down activity in other sectors. A previous estimate a number of years ago by the ESRI suggested that an increase of approximately 10,000 housing units generally added 1% to GDP growth. That gives a sense of the scale of how increased activity in the housing sector will feed into overall economic activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">We have endorsed the macroeconomic forecast from the Department of Finance which shows reasonably strong growth over the medium term, including growth this year of more than 5.5% and between 3.5% and 4% over coming years. That is on the basis of a 4,000 unit increase in housing output each year. We are trying to identify in the risk matrix the Deputy has referred to factors which might change those growth forecasts. Housing output could rise by more than 4,000 units. That estimate is reasonably modest and, as Dr. Lawless has said, an issue with housing output is that it is a labour intensive sector, which might lead to distortions in the allocations of resources in the economy. Given current forecasts, with the unemployment rate dropping down near to 5%, if there is a large increase in housing output, where will the workers come from? Will they come from other sectors within the economy, which might lead to wage pressures and competition between sectors, or will they be brought in from abroad as we have done previously?</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> We would like an increase in housing output from the point of view of the competitive concerns that Dr. Lawless raised, but the issue is how we fit that activity, in a sustainable way, into an economy that is operating close to its potential.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I welcome the witnesses. On corporation tax, everybody knows that the largest company, which will announce its results at the end of June, is Microsoft, which is probably what Mr. Coffey was indicating. It is suggested that it must have had an additional €3 billion in sales and output in Ireland to generate the additional corporation tax that the figures indicate. Are the witnesses satisfied with the mechanisms for measuring our output? Will they have enormous implications for the payments we have to make to Brussels in respect of the recognised growth in the size of the economy? How will we deal with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The witnesses referenced the demographic pressures, which are evident throughout the country, particularly in the eastern region and all the major cities.

          <p eId="para_59">Demographics is a major issue in many of the ways the Deputy has described, and IFAC examines this carefully. We looked at it in our standstill scenarios. When we refer to the medium-term, which show how much the Government needs to spend to stand still and maintain the same level of services. That reflects assumptions about the changing population and about healthcare. It was encouraging that in the stability programme the Government provided much more information about the long term, in part drawing on the European work. That is important because it is an issue that will rise up the agenda. It is partly demographics, but the bigger effect is healthcare costs and long-term care costs. IFAC plans to do further work in this area. We have seen that the exercises done by Europe and domestically are serious and well thought through, but we want to return to the assumptions because it is important to get them right and this is a subject we will prioritise over the next year.</p>

In net terms, we will benefit quite strongly. There are instances where, given how the national income measures used for EU contributions are based on gross measures and tax is paid on a net profit basis, there can be large increases in gross profits that do not translate through to tax receipts. These are leading our EU contributions to be higher. It is an issue relating to the Irish economy. We are well aware of the problems that arise with measures such as gross domestic product. These have now translated into problems with gross national product, and the CSO has tried to step aside some of these issues with its modified measures of national income. When it comes to EU contributions, they are still based on official measures as set out in the internationally agreed standards. If these are distorted, it can lead to distortions in our payments.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">Is there a calculation? The additional expected EU contributions the country has to make have been calculated. Alongside a distortion or expansion in corporation tax for the reasons we understand, does Mr. Coffey agree that, in the comparison with this corporation tax figure, the VAT figures are underperforming? I do not know whether he has commissioned a study from Revenue. There is something inconsistent about the VAT figures. Perhaps Revenue knows the answers in this regard. In the context of the corporation tax figures, the VAT figures should indicate and be consistent with lot more activity in the economy. The PRSI and PAYE figures seem to be more in line with growth. Perhaps it is a time lag - I do not know - but does Mr. Coffey have any sense as to why the VAT figures seem to be out of line?</p>

          <p eId="para_64">Estimates regarding corporation tax are outside the remit of the council. In the context of VAT, we have noticed is the system is going through some changes at present. There were changes at EU level on where VAT should be paid and whether it should be the location where the sale is made or where the customer is. There have been moves to locate more VAT payments where the customer is, and Revenue has set up, as have most countries, a mini one-stop shop to try to balance payments for sales made in one country to customers in another. Perhaps there is a rebalancing to happen as these changes work through. It is not something we have considered in any great detail. The PRSI and PAYE figures are showing the growth in the economy, particularly the PRSI figures, which are growing at 7% or 8% because they have not been subject to policy measures in recent years. In general, looking at the overall receipts we see strength in corporation tax. We do see volatility in VAT. With the bimonthly returns, there are some months when the figures up and others when they are down. Part of this can be due to the way the system is changing. The strength in the economy is being reflected in labour-related taxes and receipts.</p>

Ten years ago, many of Mr. Coffey's counterparts from the Department of Finance were in telling us everything was fine, particularly in the summer and before the recess in 2008. I worry about the rainy day fund. Mr. Tutty gave a very good explanation of its purpose. Would it be beyond our capacity, or would it be outside of the European rules, for example, to find a way to put it into social rented or social purchased housing whereby there would be an absolute calculated rate of return, on the low side probably because it would be through rents and interest payments on socially affordable mortgages? Going back to the demographics, the rent increases, particularly in the areas I represent, are not sustainable. In my constituency, many US multinational companies - even where they pay a lot of money - are certainly rethinking whether they can really afford to have people here in light of the extraordinary levels at which rents are being charged. These companies can no longer rent houses for staff who come to Ireland in the same way they had been for the past two decades. The availability-----</p>

          <p eId="para_67">We link the rainy day fund to the overall budgetary stance rather than to individual areas or pressure points we might see in the economy based on individual markets. If there are priorities that it is felt should be addressed, and the political system feels additional resources should be used to address them, that can be done while having a rainy day fund. They are not exclusive. We can do both. We can increase spending by even more than the rules allow by increasing taxes and still have the appropriate fiscal stance to try to manage the economy. It is not a very easy thing to do. If countercyclical management was something that could be easily achieved, countries would not go through the boom-bust cycle we have seen over decades. It is something we should at least be trying. If there are additional areas where it is felt more resources are required the decision should be made to allocate the resources. They can be separate decisions and both can be achieved at the same time.</p>

At least we know what we have to do. What do we have to do to protect against the possible dangers of a downturn? From where are those dangers likely to come? To me, where we should gear ourselves up and where we should invest is dependent on where those risks are most likely to come. There is no doubt about demand for property and housing. We have a demand and we have got to meet that demand, and there are no two ways about it. Is Mr. Coffey worried about another speculative property bubble here and the fact that we are actually repeating the madness of the previous downturn, which largely resulted from property speculation? What is actually happening is that there is an awful lot of speculation and not a lot of building. That is a recipe for a repeat of the previous circumstances, particularly when one considers that the level of demand is objectively big but that, in effective terms, it is weak. People do not have the money to buy property. Are we facing into a possible property slowdown again?</p>

          <p eId="para_72">The first three of these questions are clearly within our mandate. I am not sure about the final one regarding whether a speculative property bubble is on the horizon. In the context of where we are in the economic cycle, most indications point to the economy being close to its potential. The unemployment rate is falling towards 6% and is set to fall just below it and the recovery we have seen in recent years is something that happened back in the early 2000s. People who look at the Irish economy, which had grown strongly in the 1990s when the unemployment rate had fallen, asked what was in store for the Celtic tiger in 2001 and 2002. The suggestion at the time was that we would return to our long-run potential growth rate of 3% or 3.5%, that we would not see an imbalance one way or the other, and that it was something the economy could maintain as the population grew, as we had moderate inward investment and as credit expanded at a moderate pace.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Of course, what we know is that the economy did not return to growth rates of 3% to 3.5%. It stayed at 6% to 7% to 8% right through to the end of 2007. That was achieved by two means - first, by large inward migration that facilitated that increase in output and, second, much of that increase was funded by credit expansion. While the forecasts seemed reasonable at the time, what could not have been, and was not, foreseen was the huge increase in credit and the huge inward migration which allowed the economy to grow above its potential for a period of time. It could not go on forever. If something cannot go on forever it will stop, and it stopped in 2008. We are in a somewhat similar position now. The economy has grown strongly for a number of years, the unemployment rate has fallen and most forecasts are that the economy will grow between 3% to 3.5% over the medium term. That is what the Department of Finance is forecasting, and that is what we have endorsed. Overheating is a potential risk but it may not happen. If the growth rates stay at 3% to 3.5%, the economy can sustainably do that for period of time. The thing is the Irish economy does not do moderation. We have looked at it over a 60 year period. If one takes that 3% to 3.5% as one's middle point and if one reduces it down to 2% and increases it to 5%, and says that that is within the ballpark, over a 60 year period, the Irish economy is within that range of 2% to 5% less than a third of the time. It has either been growing much more quickly than 5% or lower than 2%. While the central forecast is for nice moderate growth of 3.5% and for an economy that is in a stable position, that is not something that tends to happen very regularly in the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The issue is about the direction in which it will go. In the near term, we see some potential upside risk, as has been stated with housing. As one moves out into the medium term, there are more negative risks that could lead to a downturn. How much of a buffer would one need to deal with some of those? The buffer does not need to be huge. The impact of the previous crisis was quite large. One simply wants to avoid getting into a position where one has to have forced austerity at a time when one's economy needs to be stimulated. The average increase in budget deficits around the euro area in 2008 was six percentage points of GDP. The issue was that overall budget deficits across the euro area were either in a small deficit or close to balance. One went from being in a balanced position all the way down to an annual deficit of minus 6% of GDP. One simply cannot keep borrowing 6% of GDP, particularly when growth is anaemic, which in a sense led to the debt crisis, as debts ballooned.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> The buffer itself does not have to be very large. If one had a one or two percentage points of a GDP surplus in the other direction, then one is only dropping, when the crisis comes, to 3% or 4%. We know that the EU rules have what might be considered an arbitrary point of three percentage points of GDP for the annual deficit limit. However, if one is just one or two percentage points in terms of running a surplus, one has sufficient space to deal with a reasonably-sized downturn. With a downturn like we had in 2008, it is hard to know what buffer would have been appropriate to deal with that. It does not have to be very large. What one is doing is giving oneself the capacity to absorb whatever downturn is coming, in that one is not adding to the problems by having to cut back spending. Just even cutting back spending growth can lead to problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> If we believe the economy is growing at 5% or 6% and we are growing spending at 3.5%, that in itself is countercyclical. Where the economy is growing faster, government spending in real terms is growing at a lower rate. If we hit a downturn, and the economy slows to 1% or 2%, and if we keep spending growing at 3.5%, that is an injection. That again is countercyclical. The economy has slowed down but spending is now above it. If we have this stable and steady increase in spending, to which Mr. Tutty referred, that can offer that countercyclical buffer that we are looking for.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Where will the downturn come from? It does not matter where it comes from. By and large, the impact of many of the risks we have identified will be the same. This will be a reduction in economic activity, whether it is as a result of Brexit, trade with our nearest neighbour, US trade policy, trade with one of our largest trading partners or the international tax environment and our key policy plank of attracting foreign direct investment. If one or all of them hit us, the impact would, by and large, be the same. I do not think it necessarily matters which one affects us, as long as we identify there are potential risks out there. Using the Mr. Donald Rumsfeld quotation, there are things there that we might not be seeing there at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">In a way Mr. Coffey has hit the nail on the head. He is asking for a rational central scenario-type approach. The evidence is that is not actually how things work in this economy. Frankly, I think that it is fairly dramatic irrational movements of capital that decide when a downturn comes. We should behave rationally, but we know that capital does not behave rationally. What can we do to buffer ourselves against this? To my mind, the obvious thing to do is for us to be less vulnerable to sudden movements in capital, whether it is one foreign multinational pulling out or the property sector being completely controlled by a small number of players speculating and then deciding to flip the property. Should we not be spending our resources shifting things in that direction, rather than sticking it in a piggy bank, in the context of the areas where those dangers are likely to come from? Should we not ramp up investment to create a more sustainable economy as a buffer, rather putting resources in a piggy bank, which is like Peter and the dyke when a-----</p>

          <p eId="para_81">The size of the rainy day fund itself is something we would see as being more flexible. It should respond to economic changes. Should we be ramping up investment? That is exactly what we are doing. In our previous reports, we would have analysed the planned increases in capital spending, which was set to double from 2015 to 2021, going from relatively low in EU terms to relatively high. We are ramping up investment. This year alone, the figures in the stability programme update show that public capital investment is going to increase by 23.5%. There is quite a rapid increase in public capital spending and it is within the fiscal rules. Looking at the growth forecast of the economy, these are built into the growth and the employment forecasts. That rapid increase is happening. Perhaps we are not seeing the visible signs of it yet because some of these projects take time to go from their initial formulation right through to delivery at the end. That ramping up of capital spending is there, and it has been there with additional elements added to it since we assessed it last year through the various development plans that have been announced. The investment is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">I have a few questions. One question is on the forecast horizon. As was correctly pointed out, until relatively recently the forecast horizon was five years. It is now three years on the fiscal side. I would have a concern that we have not got a proper handle on the costs that are coming down the line, when one looks at what is happening in healthcare with the cost of drugs, the ageing population, conditions such as Alzheimer's, etc., that are growing very significantly; pension costs; and costs in the education sector. To what extent would the witnesses have a concern that we are projecting our revenue, some of which is volatile, for the next three years, including corporation tax receipts? We are building up permanent expenditure commitments and we do not have medium-term to long-term estimates of the costs that we are going to be facing as a country. On that question of three years versus five years, is five years enough? How quickly do we need to start publishing five year forecasts?</p>

          <p eId="para_83">The Deputy is absolutely right. The commitment to medium-term economic stability implies that one has at least five year forecasts. That is a good practical medium-term horizon. One also needs those long-term exercises. The EU goes out to 2050 or 2060, but that those two exercises go in parallel.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> One thing that is of concern is that even within the horizon out to 2021, if one looks at what is implied for spending in the later years, spending growth slows quite a lot. That is going to be very hard to reconcile if the Government's forecasts turn out to be right and the economy is still doing well, employment is high and wages are going up. It is going to very hard to meet that. That shows the relevance of these medium-term forecasts. People need to look across the whole thing and ask whether it makes sense. There is a concern about spending growth in those later years.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">As regards changes in the bond markets and the cost of borrowing, we know that the ECB is going to start unwinding its quantitative easing, QE, programme. We know that we have €57 billion of government debt that has to be refinanced over the next five years. We must be at the bottom of the cycle in terms of interest rates. They cannot go any lower. It has to be real risk for the country. The cost of sovereign debt is going to increase, perhaps significantly. There will be implications for consumers if interest rates rise. Looking at the risk matrix, the stability programme update, SPU, puts it as a low risk - bond market conditions with a medium impact - and the IFAC commentary broadly concurs with that. It is staring us in the face that the era of zero interest rates cannot continue. History tells us that.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Interest rates are going to go up sooner or later and that is going to have an impact. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recently said that a few years ago we projected that by now we would be paying €10 billion per annum to service the national debt, whereas now it is closer to €5 billion. That is a huge swing. Where is this going to go and what will the impact be? </p>

          <p eId="para_87">There is no doubt that interest rates will change and are likely to increase. Most forecasts for interest rate increases are relatively moderate over the time period referred to, when this large amount of debt is due to be refinanced. The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is a better place to address questions on that. It has built up significant cash reserves at the historically low interest rates to put itself in a position to deal with those redemptions as they fall due over the next couple of years. I think there is close to €20 billion available, with further debt offerings planned for this year. After 2021 there will be a bit of a gap until 2023 or 2024, before the next bonds roll around again. Even if there are interest rate increases, there is no doubt that the debt we have will be refinanced at lower rates. Some of the bonds that are due to mature this year were issued 10 years ago, when interest rates were 4% or 4.5%. Some of them were issued when interest rates were lower, but of course Ireland faced a higher borrowing cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> I think the bonds will be rolled over at a lower interest cost than the current one, and we are likely to see continued savings on the interest on the national debt. The issue is that over a longer term this will eventually begin to edge upwards. It might be a decade or more before the €10 billion figure which was forecast comes into view, but it is a potential reality. There is no doubt that it is good to identify it as a risk but I think that the low probability estimate is correct, because it is one that will take a while to materialise. The estimation of the medium impact is also correct, because it is not going to happen very rapidly. We have seen the benefits of the low interest rate build up over a number of years, and equally the cost of higher rates of interest will take a few years to build up. </p>

          <p eId="para_89">Finally I wish to raise the issue of corporation tax. Today's report of the Committee of Public Accounts describes our dependence as an unacceptable risk. Some 15% or 16% of our tax revenue is corporation tax. Should we be seeking to rebalance the economy somewhat by focusing on the indigenous economy, such as SMEs, and looking at the taxation environment within which they operate? The Tax Institute will talk to us about that later. How concerned is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council about the growing dependence on corporation tax, which has doubled over about four years, and the concentration within that envelope of money? To reduce that dependence, should we be looking to rebalance the economy and introduce some changes to our overall industrial policy?</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I think the key issue is just to identify it as a risk. There is no doubt that it is better to be receiving this money than not receiving it. If corporation tax had stayed at around €4 billion or €5 billion we might not be identifying it as a risk factor. It is more than €8 billion and projected to hit €10 billion by the, albeit shortened, forecast horizon of 2021. It has moved in the reverse direction to interest. It has gone from €5 billion to €10 billion, whereas interest has gone from €10 billion to €5 billion. These are some of the huge tailwinds being referred to in relation to the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> On the risk, I am not sure I consider it an unacceptable risk. I have not seen the report published today, but I think it is something we have identified as being a potential issue, that is, the volatility which has been referred to and the dependence on a small number of firms, with the top ten accounting for 40%. Within that top ten, there is significant volatility and change in the amounts being paid. To go back to an earlier point about things not being mutually exclusive, I think we can focus on the indigenous economy and also have an FDI strategy. It is not one or the other. Our key point on corporation tax is to avoid building up and building in permanent increases in spending and permanent reduction in tax revenue on the basis that these revenues will be here forever. I do not think that would be an appropriate approach for fiscal policy to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> We have seen various proposals for how some corporation tax can or could be set aside. Some of those might have been worth following through but over the last number of years, as the corporation tax has increased, much of it has been used to fund budgetary measures. We have seen limited improvement in the budgetary position where the annual balance is concerned, even with these tailwinds. An economy growing strongly, surging corporation tax and falling interest costs are not feeding through into improvements in the public balance. These benefits are being used. The issue is that if one or more of these turns against us, underlying weaknesses in the public finances may be revealed that might not be apparent at the moment but to which these indicators. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I do not think it is something that we have to address. It is good to be collecting €8 billion in corporation tax. It is just a matter of identifying it as a potential risk or a potential source of uncertainty. </p>

          <p eId="para_96">I will not even comment on that. I remember that, and I remember the feeling and the sense of desperation as to what we had to do. For that reason, I support the rainy day fund. It makes sense, whatever the scale. The bigger the better, in some ways. I listened with interest to what Deputy Lawless said. It was said that because of the potential overheating of the economy, particularly as we ramp up housing, which we have to do, we need to look at other sectors or investment areas that we might scale back to avoid overheating. I do not know how deeply the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council goes into specific projects, but I can suggest one project that might be a perfect candidate for such a contraction. I refer to the motorway programme, where at the moment we are spending massively on upgrading the N11, the N2, the N3 and the N7, all on the approach to Dublin. This will add to our traffic problems. There will be more cars coming into a city where we are taking people's front gardens away because there are so many cars coming in. This would be a double win. It might help us to get some workers off these mad projects widening motorways into Dublin and deploy them to house-building in the centre of the city. It would be a win-win-win situation. They would not have to drive from the far reaches of the N2, N3, N7, N11 and so on. I do not know if the witnesses have any comment on that. It would be a perfect counterbalancing, defeating the construction sector to allow us to build housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> On that same issue, I was very taken with what a witness said about the interesting statistic that for every 10,000 units there is gross domestic product, GDP, growth of roughly 1%. Again, we are discussing the details of economic strategy. It seems to me that one of the key initiatives we are examining at the moment is the use of the cost-rental model for housing construction and public housing ownership. It has a fantastic advantage in my mind in that I believe it could be done off-balance sheet, as it is done in other European countries. It is the perfect counter-cyclical tool, because it is very much long-term investment, particularly over time, as an asset base is built up. It creates a revenue stream and public housing construction which is not dependent on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of the day handing out a big wad of cash, which is the worst form of matching long-term investment requirements with long-term financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> It makes sense to borrow for housing. Cost-rental is the perfect public borrowing, and indeed housing association and local authority mechanism. We are doing none of it. I think we have got 50 houses in Enniskerry, but nothing compared to where we should be. I do not know if the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is concerned with these matters. We should change the nature of the housing scheme so that we avoid this boom-bust housing model. When the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment does not have the cash he cannot build it and therefore there is an accentuation of the cyclical nature of the Irish economy, where housing contracts rapidly in bad times and then expands massively in boom times. Cost-rental irons that out. Do the witnesses think that would be a good economic response? I will leave it at that. </p>

          <p eId="para_99">I will take the Deputy's first point on the rainy day fund. I am delighted that he thinks it is a great idea. I do too, but it depends on how it is designed. One thing that we noticed recently when we did a lot of work on Ireland's cycle and its output gap was that it actually looked almost exactly the same as the pattern we have seen in investment spending as a share of GDP. During bad times it has crashed really heavily, in line with the overall economy crashing, and in good times it has risen to heights that have also been aligned with the economic cycle. That pro-cyclical pattern in investment spending by Government is a really terrible thing. There is good international research showing that construction companies find it very difficult to plan ahead on the basis of having projects for a long time-frame if they are taking on Government contracts. It means that long-term productivity in that sector is impaired.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">When we need to get projects off the ground, many of those businesses are not ready to do the project work we might desire. Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned motorway projects. We are agnostic as to the types of projects but if we continue those at a steady pace and ignore the heights and troughs of the cycle, we should be better equipped to provide them as the need arises. The planning around them would be better also.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">Housing is an area we looked at recently. Our mandate relates to the fiscal side of things and not necessarily on the appropriate model for the provision of housing in Ireland. However, we have looked at some of the changes that have happened and rather than seeing increased housing provision moving what we might call off balance sheet, with the reclassification of the approved housing bodies we have seen more of it come within the general Government sector, primarily because they are almost entirely funded from Government sources, whether they are capital projects with grants from local authorities or borrowing through the Housing Finance Agency. Their current receipts for providing the properties come from the availability payments they get from local authorities, which top up the rent they receive to 90% of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> We compare it to other countries in terms of where their capital spending on public housing appears and if it shows up in their general government accounts, and it does not. It is clear, therefore, that there is a different model out there and one of those might be cost rental housing where non-profit agencies charge possibly controlled rents but rents based on the cost. In that way they do not have to be fully funded from Government sources and more of their income is coming through the rent they are charging the tenants rather than on subsidies coming through the Government sector that have been on balance sheet. The current moves in Ireland are the opposite of what the Deputy is suggesting. More activity is coming on balance sheet and it would require a change in the approach to have it move in the direction he suggests but that is possibly a question for the Housing Finance Agency, which deals with many of the approved housing bodies. A change in the way the rental situation is addressed might move it in that direction but, unfortunately from the Deputy's perspective, the move is in the other direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">I am new to this committee so I will start by asking a general question on fiscal advisory councils, which are relatively new in the process since 2011. To what degree do the Government or Opposition parties listen to the witnesses in terms of their advice? Second, on the issue of costing proposals, we hear Deputies making requests and suggesting proposals daily in the Dáil. They say they want to see improvements in areas and increases in various sectors and there is criticism about how much those will cost. Do the witnesses listen to those proposals and requests? Unlike Deputy Eamon Ryan and Deputy Burton, I was not at the centre of the economic crash but I was listening to what was happening at a political level coming into 2011. While my party was being blamed for the crash, many more promises were being made going into that election in terms of increasing spending. To what degree have fiscal advisory councils in other countries been successful in keeping governments and opposition parties on the straight and narrow and making sure we do not get some of the things to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred? I know that as sure as there is an up in the economy it will be followed by a down but how do we ensure the success of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the ESRI or any of the other independent advice the Government or parties get?</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> I compliment the secretariat on the types of questions it has indicated, although I am sure we will not get to deal with half of them. Is it important that the questions are dealt with now or are they given to the IFAC for its response if they are not reached?</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I will start with the last question indicated, which relates to commercial stamp duty. What are the witnesses' views on the commercial stamp duty increases introduced in the 2018 budget? As part of that, on the issue of tax reliefs being provided for research and development, do they believe there are more effective ways of doing that?</p>

          <p eId="para_106">On the effectiveness of councils and whether we are listened to, those of us on this side of the table are the worst people to judge that but I will allow the Deputy to form his own views and perhaps ask his colleagues as to whether they are listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> More seriously, there are two points. I have been on the council since the beginning and the reason I am still on it is because I believe it does have an impact. Having an independent expert body that does a huge amount of work looking over all these kinds of issues very carefully is of service to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I would point out also that for one of the budgets, which I cannot recall now, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said that his decision had been influenced by the council and that had it not been for the council's advice, he would have done something different. That is reassuring to me that we are having a useful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Internationally, a huge number of councils have been set up in recent years, most of which are very new so it is a little too early to say if they have been successful. However, there is a longer history of councils such as in the United States and Sweden. The Office for Budget Responsibility, OBR, has been going a bit longer in the United Kingdom. One of the determining factors in the success of those councils has been the political commitment around them. In countries where people were not committed to sound public finances or listening to the council's advice, they were not very effective. In systems where people were serious minded and concerned about medium-term stability, they found councils a very useful instrument to make that happen. It is a bit like the rainy day fund. It can be set up but if money is not put into it, it will not be of any help. If a country is committed to making the hard choices not to spend money, it may work. I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">On the commercial stamp duty, I commented on that at our last visit here and I found myself being quoted at another Oireachtas committee a few months later and appearing in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which surprised me. At the time, we were looking at the level of increase the Department of Finance was projecting from the stamp duty increase and it seemed to be assuming that the boom in commercial property would continue. We were worried that we would use money from boom time commercial stamp duty to fund long-term expenditures once again. We were querying whether it would bring in that sort of revenue over time. The receipts so far this year have been behind what the Department of Finance was estimating so we may find that all the money is not coming in, even in the first year, not to mind that it will come in in later years. Like corporation tax, we should not be making our long-term expenditure dependent on receipts from a cyclical type of revenue. That commercial building will not last forever at the sort of rate it was taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The Deputy spoke about the proposals that continue to be put forward by Deputies. We do not have a remit to determine where our money should be spent. We have a remit to examine the overall balance between expenditure and revenue. We would not be concerned about more expenditure as long as it is being funded from extra revenue. We do not have to start looking at individual proposals in different areas and say we believe that is good or it is not good. That is a matter for the politicians to look at and determine what the balance is between different expenditures.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">The research and development tax credit is a large tax expenditure. The annual cost now is approaching €1 billion so clearly it is something worthy of consideration again. As Mr. Tutty said, we do not focus on individual measures but something which has a tax cost of €1 billion is worthy of consideration by various bodies. If we look at the broader environment, research and development is a cost. Companies will be looking at the benefit they get from incurring that cost and that will be a reduction in their tax bill. In Ireland, it will reduce the tax bill by 12.5% or whatever cost they incur. In the United States, until recently, it would have reduced their tax bill by 35% of whatever cost they would incur because of the tax rate that applied in the US at that time. That is the environment in which our research and development tax credit was established, given the nature of the companies here and trying to attract activity that might take place in other countries. Given the change in the US tax rates, it might be worthy of analysis to see whether the research and development tax credit itself should be subject to changes. However, given the size of it, it is worthy of scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> On the proposals made, I agree with Mr. Tutty that that is not within our mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">However, there are newly established institutions within the Oireachtas itself that can look at some of these proposals. Perhaps they could move towards costing them and providing the aggregated figures the Deputy has looked for in which the proposals of various parties would be put together. On the Deputy's point on the degree to which Governments listen, I would add that our audience is broader than the Minister, for whom we write the formal report to which he, in turn, writes a response. We engage with the committee to express our views and, equally, the audience is the general public. The reason a fiscal account would be set up is to have that independent analysis and to have an institution that builds up a reputation and offers a view to the public it might not otherwise hear. It might not necessarily just be about changing policy. It can be about getting clear views out there.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maria Bailey<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_115">I have a couple of specific questions and some general ones. If the rainy day fund was to be strengthened and used as a countercyclical fund, what level of funding do the witnesses think should be diverted to it? Are we currently putting enough aside? On the rules at EU level which would need to be changed in order for Ireland to have enough flexibility to access a rainy day fund, what is required and needed to do that?</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> Getting back to some general things about the construction industry, it currently makes up 7% or 8% of GDP. At the time of boom and bust it made up 20%. What level do the witnesses think is a dangerous level to be at? I ask that because a number of questions were asked around property speculators and all the bad words that developers are called which go under that umbrella. We had a very interesting meeting yesterday at which we heard that 86% of landlords in our rental market own one or two properties. In my estimation they are either accidental landlords or it is their retirement fund. It is definitely not for profit, so to speak. A very small percentage of our rental sector is made up of those bigger commercial landlords. Some of the rent legislation we have put through in the last year or so has really helped to steady that market. I refer to the rent pressure zones and further measures. My fear is that some of the legislation coming at us again will push things too far and will affect that 86% heavily, meaning that they might pull out of the market, rather than affecting that very small 3% or 5% that have a greater number of units on the rental market. I fear that will create a problem in the property market.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> The other thing is around sustainability in construction, which we talk about all the time, and the skills shortage we have. While we are improving the apprenticeship courses and trying to incentivise people to get back into these trades, one of the problems we have in terms of skill shortages is deciding how to incentivise and encourage people to go into these courses, to incentivise and encourage people who emigrated to come back, and to incentivise and encourage people who stayed, who retrained and who might be ten years in another career to get back into the construction industry with the vast experience and knowledge they would have had. My view, and I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses, is that they will only come back in when they see sustainability in the construction industry and when they do not see another cycle of boom and bust. At the construction levels we have projected, will the national development plan help sustainability? It gives a roadmap to the 500,000 additional homes that will be required in the next 20 years, to the 660,000 jobs that will need to be filled and to the infrastructure that will be required. For the first time in a long time we have a statutory road map for the next 20 years so that people can actually see the sectors in which they will see growth and will be able to plan their futures in a far more cohesive manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_118"> A number of questions were asked already. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned cost rental. He mentioned the pilot project in Enniskerry we are talking about. While cost rental is just one measure of a general stock that will be required within the market, other areas at which I am interested in looking are projects such as rent-to-buy. I know we do not want to get into specific projects or policies but, in simple terms, rent-to-buy, which we piloted years ago, means that local authorities develop schemes of, for example, 50 units. People pay rent at a lower rate, for example €1,000 a month. After four or five years that rent is used as their deposit. Do the witnesses see it as sustainable for the Government to introduce a policy such as that? They may not want to answer that here but I can give them the information around it.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I will start with the rainy day fund. We would not set a figure for the size of the rainy day fund because we see it as being a countercyclical item. As long as the economy is growing, money would be put into it and, when the economy is not growing so well, money would be taken out, as opposed to us saying €500 million or €1 billion should be put in every year. In the paper we published on our website, we set a certain rate for economic growth - whatever would be viewed as the long-term growth rate of the economy - and then any extra money available would be put into the rainy day fund when the economy is growing quickly. The fund would then build up and when the economy is growing slowly the money could be taken out. We would not set a figure. We would not say that it should be a certain sum and that we should stop there.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> In terms of money coming out, the present fiscal rules do not really allow for a rainy day fund to operate. We have put forward proposals in our paper, that would have to be negotiated with the European Commission and with the other member states, as to how this could happen in a way which would regard the money going into the rainy day fund as expenditure at the time we have the fiscal space available to put it in. This would not be the case at the moment as the money is staying in the general government sector. These proposals do not regard the money as expenditure which might breach the expenditure benchmark when it is going out and being spent. I do not want to get into the technicalities here but we think there is an easy way of doing this which we are pretty happy could be negotiated with the Commission and which could also be of interest to the other member states. As I have said, we would not set a figure for it. As long as the boom continues anything above a certain growth level should be put in to be used on the way out.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I will take on the property questions. The Deputy asked whether we had some idea of what a sustainable level for the property sector is. In terms of when the sector gets too big, we could say that it is when it starts to negatively impact on other sectors and we see obvious pressures on prices and wages. A common theme throughout our comments on all aspects of the public finances, the overall balance of the economy and, probably, the construction sector in particular is very much an emphasis on long-term sustainability and avoiding the pattern of booms and busts such as we have seen in both public finances and individual sectors. There should be a formulation in which there is a medium to long-term plan of investment both on the public and private sides that is facilitated by the smooth running of access to finance and the rules in terms of how the property sector gets planning permission and how infrastructure is put in place. The overall objective would be to have investment in infrastructure and residential building proceed at a steady pace that grows in line with demographics and demand for housing and which avoids this boom and bust cycle. We are not able to put a precise figure on what that means for the percentage of employment or amount of activity in the sector. It is really about drawing a smooth path forward with a focus on the medium-term projections both within the sector and within the economy as a whole.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_124">I welcome the delegation from IFAC. I want to ask about the report released today which asserts that we are the biggest tax haven in the world. The figures quoted suggested that there is something like the size of the whole UK economy or twice the size of the Russian economy in funds based here. Following on from that, Yanis Varoufakis and others have been saying that we are riding on the back of European taxation policy and that we can raise funds in a different way from everybody else. Do the witnesses see these claims and this kind of discussion outside our country as a significant risk factor for Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Linked to that are the proposals Emmanuel Macron makes in his book <i>Révolution</i> in respect of, for example, the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, becoming the bedrock of future financing of European budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> Are there significant external threats from the way people perceive the way we manage our economy and, also, the European changes? Reference was made to spending drift. What is spending drift? Is it spend on much needed additional beds and the consultants that go with them, orphan drugs for rare diseases, budgets for social housing and pay equality in the public service? On the figures in regard to fiscal space, are we down now to €2.6 billion or €1.8 billion in terms of manoeuvre? It was stated that it is up to us as politicians to decide whether in terms of additional taxation yield we opt for sustainable growth of our expenditures, but the witnesses have been very coy about how we might balance an increased expenditure budget, such as is needed for the crisis in housing. I do not agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan. He was a senior member of the Green Party-Fianna Fáil Government that drove the country off the cliff. It is annoying to hear comments about connections to rural areas like the north west or my ancestral county of Wexford and that we will never have a proper road network linking all parts of this island. As I said, the witnesses are being very coy about how we would balance an enhanced budget. Research and development credits was mentioned. Would there be any scope, for example, for additional personal taxation for the 300,000 tax units who earn more than €100,000? The Taoiseach tells us that people who earn more than €100,000 are not necessarily rich or better off. </p>
          <p eId="para_127"> On the rainy day fund, why do we need it in 2019? We already have the strategic investment fund, such that we would be only taking money from one fund and putting into another. Why would we handicap ourselves in 2019 given the many areas, including health, housing, education and so on, we need to address for our burgeoning population and our younger population? I agree with a sovereign wealth fund. We did have one but the Government of which Deputy Eamon Ryan was a member, the last Government and this Government raided a chunk of it and blew it or, as the late Peter Mathews would say, tore it up. Why 2019 and why not return to an enhanced sovereign fund at a future date?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_56">
          <from> Mr. Sebastian Barnes<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_128">I will answer two of the questions and leave the others to my colleagues. Deputy Broughan asked about spending and the term "spending drift". The fact that spending is increasing is a good thing, in most cases. The economy is growing and that is good news because that generates resources which, in turn, pay for increased spending in some of the areas mentioned. Spending is not necessarily a bad thing. We believe that spending in the good times should grow at a steady pace and in the bad times should grow at that same steady pace, such that we do not have a boom and bust in public spending for some of the reasons outlined by my colleagues. A rainy day fund allows us to smooth this out. As tax revenue goes up and down we want spending to grow slowly and sustainably to build the type of economy which I am sure members want.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> Spending drift, however, is a different concept. Spending drift is about money that comes in unexpectedly and how it is managed. Over the past couple of years we have had favourable tail winds, some on the tax side, some on the corporation tax side and some in the form of lower interest payments, but this money has been spent. Money that comes in that was unexpected is usually money that is less likely to be sustainable. It is sensible to be prudent about this money and to save and ensure that it is available for the future. The concern is around spending drift in regard to new money that comes in unexpectedly, over and above the fact that it was anticipated that the economy would grow. This is very relevant in the context of budget decisions. If by the autumn unexpected additional tax revenues over and above the strong growth that is already factored into the Government's forecasts appear this yield should be saved because there is a big chance it will be a transitory and unsustainable. That that spending is rising in general is encouraging. We are arguing for decisions to be made that will help to sustain that but the spending drift of spending money just because it is there is bad economically and it is risky as well.</p>

          <from> Dr. Martina Lawless<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_130">I will take up the Deputy's questions on the research which received some coverage in this morning's paper on Ireland's status as a tax haven. There are number of international definitions of "tax haven", including an OECD definition. In those definitions the focus is on whether there is a zero or nominal rate of taxation on multinationals; they are treated differently from domestic firms; whether there is tax secrecy laws or restrictions on sharing of tax information with other countries and whether there is no substantive activity associated with the multinational activity within the country. It is pretty widely agreed across all of the international organisations that buy this set of criteria that Ireland is not a tax haven. The research that was published this morning took a list of tax havens that had been put together by some academics in the early 1990s, drawing on data from the 1980s. The issue is that it took Ireland's export tax relief, which was 0% in the 1980s, as special treatment of multinationals. It was not particularly evidence of special treatment of multinationals in that it applied also to sales by domestically owned exporters. In any event, this tax relief has long since been phased out over more than 20 years. To the extent that there was initially a rationale in 1993 for Ireland's position on this list of tax havens, I do not think anybody would agree now that Ireland is a tax haven. Ireland is a big base for FDI but that is not in and of itself evidence that the country is a tax haven.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> The Deputy is correct that in terms of the perception that Ireland may be unfairly competing for activities where activities are being booked, particularly digital activities where it is hard to distinguish the source of the sales versus where the value is being created, is a concern for Ireland's international image. In terms of discussions at European level on how corporate tax could be differently allocated across countries - the common consolidated corporate tax base proposals - we have raised on a regular basis in our fiscal assessment reports that changes to the corporate tax environment across Europe could be a significant risk for Ireland. If the proposals suggest that the tax revenues be allocated on the basis of where the sales take place rather than where the company is headquartered or the employment is, this would work against a small economy like Ireland that is exporting a lot of these services. We pointed to this as a significant risk going forward for Ireland's economic structure.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">On the rainy day fund, our rationale for a rainy day fund is to avoid the booms and busts in the economy. We believe that when the economy is growing strongly and starting to overheat, possibly, we should put funds away rather than add to expenditure in the economy such that we then have those funds available when the economy has slowed down.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">The rationale for 2019 is that the economy is growing in line with its potential and, possibly, starting to overheat. We are not suggesting a figure of €500 million. Rather, we are saying that growth in the economy should be monitored and an amount for next year determined on that basis. The council has not put a figure on the amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The rationale is there of trying to smooth out the booms and busts. If we did not spend the money on reduced debt we would not have a fund that could be taken out and we might not be able to borrow the money under the fiscal rules. We see the need for a slight amendment to the fiscal rules to allow a countercyclical rainy day fund to operate in a way whereby we can put the money away and use it in the downturn.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee. I am the director of the institute and I am joined by my colleagues Professor McQuinn and Dr. Wren.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> This opening statement will be broken up into three sections. We will discuss the macroeconomy and housing, and in this context we will probably go over some of the material covered with IFAC. We will then turn to health, which will be a bit different, and we will end with some brief remarks on a number of areas that we see as being particularly important. We will cover short-term and longer-term issues, and we will do so based on the view that a budget in any single year should be framed in the context of short-term and longer-term challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> The domestic economy looks set to register strong growth again in 2018 and into 2019. Since 2014, Ireland has experienced the largest growth each year across the European Union and the euro area. Initially, the recovery in economic activity was primarily export driven. However, over the past number of years growth, due to investment and consumption, has been more prominent. The ongoing resurgence of the economy serves as an important backdrop to the formulation of the budget. The recent publication of the stability programme update provides the outline of the Government’s fiscal strategy for the coming years. This comes at a time when the discretion available to the Government in terms of fiscal space has increased considerably relative to previous years. This greater discretion applies at a time when the foremost policy challenge is transitioning the economy from elevated growth rates as the economy experiences a rapid recovery to more sustainable growth rates over the medium-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> It is clear that there are growing demands on the public purse. The Government launched the national development plan, NDP, earlier in the year, whereby significant increases in capital expenditure are envisaged over the medium-term. Also, the significant hardship experienced by many in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis has resulted in calls for reductions in rates of personal taxation. Given the very strong economic performance at present, it is imperative that fiscal policy does not risk overheating the economy. Given the clear need for increases in capital expenditure, as articulated in the NDP, and ongoing pressures on current spending, it is difficult to see scope for significant tax cuts without adding to the risk of overheating.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> It is generally understood that the current high price of housing reflects a substantial shortage of housing units. Although prices are still below their 2007 peak, the sustained increases pose significant affordability issues, particularly for low income earners in the Dublin market. Rising house prices are more likely to affect those at the bottom of the income distribution, for whom it is harder to obtain a mortgage and for whom housing costs have a much larger weight in the household budget. Importantly, recent data from the Property Services Regulatory Authority indicates that the sharper growth rate in house prices is at the lower end of the price distribution. Underpinned by strong housing demand, we expect housing completions to grow strongly this year. We expect housing completions, as measured by electricity connections, to increase by 25,000 units in 2018, growing again to 31,000 in 2019. However, this figure is still lower than the estimated structural demand for housing, which is approximately 35,000 units per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> In an Irish context, it is important to examine the interrelationship between fiscal sustainability and the financial cycle. At present, given developments in the property market, mortgage credit levels are growing significantly. While overall stocks of credit are still somewhat below the 2008 peak, it is evident that increasing house prices, coupled with growing levels of disposable income, are likely to bring about further increases in the extension of credit. This likely increase in future household credit levels is a further reason for the Government to exercise caution in the formulation of fiscal policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> At present, while overheating in the economy is a significant internal risk, there are also a number of external risks to Ireland's economic outlook. Continued uncertainty as to the future of the European Union, whether through Brexit or issues in other member states, serves to remind us of the exposed nature of the Irish economy to external trade. This exposure is further accentuated given the present volatile trade relations which were evident at the recent G7 meeting. It has been established in a variety of research carried out by economists in the ESRI and elsewhere that any reduction in global trade and in global economic activity have direct negative impacts on the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> We will now turn to our discussion of health, and in so doing we will take a longer-term perspective. However, in order to meet the longer-term challenges that we will discuss, policy reactions in the near-term are needed. Our remarks on health are based on our programme of research with the Department of Health, particularly the Projections of Demand for Healthcare in Ireland, 2015-2030 report published last October. This report provides annual projections of demand for public and private health and social care services for the years 2015 to 2030. I will list a certain amount of the main findings and I hope committee members can stay with me. The population of Ireland is projected to grow by between 14% to 23%, adding 640,000 to 1.1 million people. The share of population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from one in eight to one in six. The number of people aged over 85 is projected to almost double. Demand for health and social care is projected to increase across all sectors, with the greatest increases for services for older people. Demand for home help hours is projected to increase by between 38% to 54%. Demand for residential and intermediate care places in nursing homes and other settings is projected to increase by between 40% to 54%. Demand for public hospital services is projected to increase by between 32% to 37% for inpatient bed days and between 24% to 30% for inpatient cases. Demand for GP visits is projected to increase by between 20% to 27%, while demand for practice nurse visits is projected to increase by between 26% to 32%.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> The report assumes no change in models of care. However, further research is examining the potential effects of policy developments that could reduce projected demand in some sectors but which could increase projected demand in others.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The report also provides projections of demand for inpatient and day cases in public and private hospitals, maternity services, public hospital emergency department and outpatient services, pharmaceuticals, pharmacy consultations, home care packages, public health nursing and public community therapy services. The report also includes the effect of unmet need and demand where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> There are important policy implications from the report’s findings, many of which mirror and complement the implications of the Sláintecare report. The projected increases in the demand for health services, arising from increases in the population generally and in the older population in particular, come after two decades of rapid population growth, a decade of cutbacks in public provision of care and a consequent build-up of unmet need and demand for care. </p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The additional demand projected in the report for the years to 2030 will give rise to demands for additional expenditure, capital investment and expanded staffing. This will have major implications for capacity planning, workforce planning and training. Additional investment will be required in most forms of care to meet the needs of a rapidly growing and ageing population. </p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Before concluding, we wanted to touch on some additional issues that are enormously important and so should not be overlooked. Each issue is part of a global trend and yet domestic policy has a key role to play. Population ageing is one of these issues but has been discussed already in the context of health spending. The other three issues are climate change, inequality and the productivity slowdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> On climate change, the latest information from the EPA is that Ireland is likely to miss its 2020 target for greenhouse gas emissions and that emissions are projected to continue growing. As it has been suggested that the bill for missing our 2020 targets could be in the region of €500 million, there is a clear budgetary implication for inaction. Apart from fines, Ireland needs to make more progress on our climate commitments if we are to be seen as responsible partners in this global effort. Policy announcements such as the climate elements in the national development plan and the national mitigation plan are to be welcomed but the scale of the challenge may not have reached a wide audience yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The issue of rising inequality across many OECD countries has been discussed extensively. Within Ireland, it strikes us that much of the debate in recent times has centred on how income is distributed across households and whether we see increases or decreases in measures of inequality from year to year. According to this analysis, we know that Ireland is a relatively unequal country when judged by the distribution of market income. However, we also know that Ireland’s income tax and social welfare system is highly redistributive and so Ireland achieves a middle ranking in terms of inequality when household disposable income is considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> With the greater availability of longitudinal datasets, through which the same individuals are tracked over time, we are able to get better insights into the following critical question: to what extent do the same people remain in poorer situations? This question is not answered by the research I have described. We will provide two examples from ESRI research which show the importance of tracking people over time. First, in a study published in January, colleagues show how lone parents and the children of lone parents are much more likely to remain in poverty when compared with other groups. Second, research published by colleagues in October 2017 and May 2018 shows how children differ by socioeconomic group as they transition into primary school and secondary school. These results serve as a reminder that we should think about equality over the life cycle and design policy accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> As a final note in this section, we will touch on the issue of the productivity slowdown, which is evident in many western economies. While there is much debate internationally about the nature and causes of this slowdown, we will focus here on the challenge in Ireland. Research from the OECD, the Department of Finance and others has shown that productivity rates in Irish-owned companies are low. ESRI research has shown that Ireland’s SMEs tend to be investing less than might be expected and this is not accounted for by restrictions on lending. Hence, there is an ongoing challenge in developing the indigenous sector and this is all the more urgent in the context of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> We have moved across a range of issues and topics and have only touched on many of the complexities involved. However, we hope to develop some of the themes in response to questions from Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I will chair the national economic dialogue, NED, again on 27 and 28 June. Members of the committee have been invited and I take this opportunity to encourage their attendance. While many representatives of different groups will be present, it strikes me each year at the NED that the broader public is only represented if public representatives such as committee members attend and participate actively.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">When thinking about overheating, people tend to think about fiscal policy, tax and Government expenditure and that is central to any discussion of overheating. Based on our experience in this country, and in many other OECD countries over the past ten years, it is very important that we focus both on fiscal policy and on what we call the financial cycle and in particular on how much credit is being extended in the real economy. What we have been struck by over the last period, and we are not the only ones, is there has been a very significant pick-up in credit. This is understandable in the context of the housing market picking up, more people buying properties and greater activity in the market. We need to heed the lessons of the past. The real difficulty we got into back in 2007 and 2008 was not all necessarily down to the fiscal policy side of things. It was down to the combination of fiscal policy and credit policy. It is certainly something we need to keep an eye on. The committee has just heard from representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Their assessment is the economy is very near potential. It is worth putting in context that the economy has been growing very rapidly. The challenge, as we said in our comments, is to see how we can ensure we go from an economy that is growing very rapidly because we are recovering from a very pronounced downturn and to try to transition that to more sustainable rates of growth over the medium term. Most other commentators, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Service and the Central Bank, would not say the economy is overheating but they would flag it as a concern. We need to broaden our understanding of it in terms of looking at it from both the fiscal and financial side of things.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I can buy into that analysis. We made a freedom of information request for some of the Minister's briefing documents on the issue of overheating. One of the rationales for the rainy day fund is to prevent overheating. It is almost being put up as the only solution. When the EU Commission made a number of recommendations, particularly on how to prevent overheating, it mentioned investment, reduction of debt, broadening the tax base and preparing for the demographic pressures, which Professor Barrett touched on in terms of health. It focused particularly on our childcare system and the investment in it, the investment in adult education, as well as dealing with the mortgage arrears issue. It did not mention a rainy day fund. We heard the spending drift mentioned and that when we get unexpected income, we should not spend it but should put it into a rainy day fund. Is it not true that it depends on what it is spent on? If it is spent on social welfare payments there is an impact on that when the economy takes a dip but what if we spend it on trying to avoid issues that may overheat the economy, such as plugging the skills gap? We are talking about employment being around 4% but we still have a youth unemployment rate of approximately 12%. We still have issues around the lack of investment in childcare and in certain sectors in the economy. Is it not fair to say there are plenty of other options available to prevent the overheating of the economy and it does not always have to be that when we get the additional income or reach the balance targets, whatever the balance is, that anything in excess should be squirrelled away? Is it not also fair to say that we could put things into capital investment and that in itself would prevent overheating?</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I will deal with a number of the points. We will focus on this in our next economic commentary, which will be out early next week. We will look at and trace the impacts of increased investment in the economy versus the implications of cutting taxes and the related impacts of that on a variety of different economic indicators. Our starting point would be the plans outlined by the Government as far as the national development plan is concerned, which signifies and indicates there will be a significant increase in investment over the medium term. Some of that is already beginning, which can be seen from the figures. Most people would agree that we need increased investment in a variety of different areas. Many infrastructural deficits, to give it the technical term, have arisen in the past ten years, not least in areas such as housing, because of the cutback we observed. What we were trying to do is to highlight the dangers that could arise from increasing investment that does not focus on productive areas and could cause overheating in the economy. Similarly, we also wanted to look at the impact of cutting taxes on overheating of the economy and to look at the combined package of the two. We think it is important to do this at this point in time. The economy is growing very strongly and we are coming back to the potential level so it is very important how we handle the impact of investment on overheating in the next couple of years. I do not think the rainy day fund in itself is purely about preventing overheating. I think it is probably complex. I am not here to support it or propose it. I think it is about more prudent fiscal policy, the idea that one has a fund to which one can divert funds that one does not believe are ongoing current funds that are likely to there on an ongoing basis and then one can use those funds when there is an economic downturn. For instance, some people have suggested as an example that if we had had the funds available in 2008 to 2009, which we did not, it would have been an opportunity to spend money in areas such as social housing. It would have helped to counterbalance the fact that the economy was going into a very sharp downturn and we could have offset some of the impacts by putting money into the economy. If we had had the fund at that stage, that would have been a good practical use of it. Obviously the funds that we had at that stage had to go into plugging holes in the balance sheets of the banks. That is my understanding of what the rainy day fund is. I would not necessarily focus on it as a means of solely preventing overheating. It is more for prudent fiscal policy over the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I will outline one other area. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned various measures to tackle overheating in the economy. I think one crucial difference this time round from the last time - again it goes back to the idea of incorporating developments in financial markets - is the new macro prudential policy framework, which I think is very important because if properly implemented it will hopefully ensure that we do not see the unsustainable levels in credit growth emerging, which we clearly did up to 2007 and 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I welcome the delegation. I have looked at the ESRI Review of Research 2017, which is a very impressive document covering all the areas they have worked on during that year and across a range of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I have some questions arising from Dr. McQuinn's introductory remarks. On the figures for housing completions, which were based on the number of ESB connection installations, do the housing statistics on completions stand up? One of my key objectives would be to build up the number of house completions to 35,000 to 40,000 units per annum. I understand that during the boom we built 90,000 houses in one specific year, which is the level of houses that would be built in the UK. What is the overall implication of that in terms of capital investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> On health spending, I am looking at the predictions up to 2030, which are based on demographics. The demographics can show a significant range, as we could have an additional 40,000 to 60,000 people arising from migration flows. There is an all-party commitment to Sláintecare; is it possible to start putting real figures on health spending? What does it mean for future budgets? We are spending €15 billion at present yet we have significant waiting lists in acute health care, for example in cataract surgery, early childhood assessment and so on.<b>
						</b>Could the witnesses give us a firmer figure for the level of spending we would need to do across the health sector? Professor Barrett mentioned productivity and this is a point of concern because in economics, productivity is everything, is it not? What should we do about that? The committee has been heavily involved and produced a report on the issue of gender equality and the very modest programme in that area the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has undertaken and I note that Professor Barrett highlights in his own report and research the very small percentage of higher positions in the Civil Service that are held by women. Generally speaking, is increasing the involvement of women at all levels in the workforce linked to higher productivity?</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I commend the witnesses on the outstanding work they have been doing across a range of areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I will kick off on the Deputy's final point and then will hand over to Dr. Maev-Ann Wren and Dr. Kieran McQuinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> On the issue of productivity, Deputy Broughan is correct. Mr. Martin Wolf has an article in <i>The Financial Times</i> this morning and he makes the point that productivity is everything. When one is talking about medium-term growth projections, there is an assumption that there will be productivity growth over time and that is what delivers living standard increases over the medium term. We are observing this productivity slowdown internationally which often comes as quite a surprise to people as everybody assumes that in the digital age with so much happening that productivity should be blasting ahead but it is not. If one brings that into Ireland the situation gets a little bit more complicated because we have this twin track economy. We have some incredibly productive companies, at least on paper, which are typically foreign-owned and in contrast our core of domestic companies have much lower productivity levels. This is well understood and well discussed. There were two strands of ESRI research that tried to look at this recently; I referred in my introductory remarks to the fact that for quite a while we have been worried about under-investment in Irish SMEs. For quite a long time coming out of the recession the assumption, for which there was good evidence, was that this was about a restricted credit supply to these companies, given the difficulties with the banks. However, the most recent research would suggest that the under-investment in Irish SMEs is not related substantially to credit flows but is about something to do with risk appetite among Irish SMEs. That is clearly a concern. The second issue we have looked at recently goes to the following question and I will give 15 seconds to economic history. When Whitaker proposed models of foreign direct investment and the opening up of Ireland, the theory was always that the foreign direct investment companies would come into Ireland, that the domestic population would gain entrepreneurial management experience and over time there would be spillovers from the international sector to the domestic sector. In a sense this should have been a transition path. I have argued this on a number of occasions. I think that if TK Whitaker were still alive - perhaps he thought it in the later part of his life - he would have been surprised that 50 years to 60 years after his innovation we still had a relatively surprising dependence on foreign direct investment and what we increasingly see is that the sort of spillovers that were envisaged have not happened to the extent that we would have thought. Again the ESRI research on this has tried to identify which companies achieve these spillovers.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">There needs to be a sufficient level of human capital within the company to be able to absorb the spillovers. We know something about the types of companies that do well here. Again - and I referred to this in the opening statement in the context of Brexit - we need to look at the domestic industrial sector and issues surrounding investment, human capital, managerial training and a range of other things, and a programme of work could then be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> To come to the second point the Deputy raised, one of the most interesting studies we did within the institute last year was on the question why there are so few women in the upper echelons of the Civil Service. Both qualitative and quantitative research was carried out. One of the key findings of this was that men and women are as likely to be promoted when they apply but that the big difference between men and women across the Irish Civil Service is that men are much more likely to apply for promotion than women are. One of the qualitative pieces of research that came out of this made a point that I think everyone at one level knows, but it was interesting to see it written down. If a man satisfies two of five criteria specified for a job promotion, he applies; if a woman satisfies four out of the five, she tends not to apply. Again, there are a great many sociological reasons why this might apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Moving on, we have learned these barriers in the Civil Service. Again, there has been research that shows there are barriers elsewhere. There is broad international evidence that shows that the most productive workplaces are the most diversified. The first time I came across this literature was in the context of migration. It shows that diversified workforces tend internationally to be more productive. It is similar if there is an age distribution, the theory being that whatever problem one is confronting, the diversity of views tends to generate a more innovative approach to it. There could well be links between gender and productivity in Irish workplaces, but perhaps that is pushing it a little.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I will hand over to Dr. Wren, who will address the issue of health.</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Dr. Maev-Ann Wren<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_178">I thank Deputy Broughan for his questions. To address first of all his question about the wide range in the demographic projections, they reflect varying assumptions on three factors, namely, life expectancy, fertility or births and, most importantly, migration. The higher figure, 1.1 million, above all reflects assumed much greater inward migration. This would be predominantly in the middle-age cohorts, that is, between about 15 and 44. What we can say we know with some certainty, however, is that the people who will be 80 and 85 in 2030 are in the country now. Therefore, between those two projections there is actually very little difference. It is in and around 90% for 80 years and over and nearly 100%, nearly a doubling, for 85 years and over. This rapid ageing that we project is in a sense a certainty. One could say that the higher demographic growth overall projection is an optimistic one because it implies that we would have the younger people to staff the services, join the labour force and pay taxes and so on to support the needs of the older population. Given our ageing, therefore, we need to hope for greater population growth in a sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> In answer to the Deputy's question about what this means for future budgets, we are not in a position to answer that yet. What I can say to him is that regarding the projections of demand we have done, which in the opening statement were expressed from 2015 to 2030, annual average increases are about 1% to 3% per annum across services. In fact, for those services used more by older people, such as long-term care and home care, the figure is 2% to 3%. For other services it is 1% to 2%. When one considers increases in budgets overall, this probably sounds like a sustainable path but of course that is volume and the other component of expenditure is price. We are currently working on developing our model to be able to project expenditures. This will involve looking at issues such as potential pathways for public sector pay, for skill mix and for pharmaceutical prices. We hope to be in a position in a year's time or two years' time to come back and to talk about these.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> To make a further point on this, do we have a sense of where we are building from? This work has not been done before in Ireland. When the EU ageing reports, which project the effects on expenditure out to 2050 and which were referenced earlier by IFAC, were published, Ireland was one of three countries that could not supply an age cost profile - in other words, how much was being spent on health services by age within the population. Ireland, Greece and Romania were the three countries that could not supply this because our data have been so poor. Part of the big project in which we have been involved with the support of the Department of Health and with a great deal of involvement with stakeholders such as the HSE involves trying to improve the data sources in order that we can project with some certainty. For instance, were one to use those EU ageing reports, the Irish projections are based on the assumption that Ireland's expenditure profile by age is the same as the EU average, which is a big reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Finally, regarding the Deputy's question about waiting lists, we have done our level best with the data available to include in our projections of demand what it would take to meet not only the effects of demographic growth and ageing but also current unmet demand. We have used waiting lists where those data have been available and, where available, survey evidence on unmet need expressed by people who return the surveys.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">On the housing side of things, as the committee is probably aware, there has been quite a lot of discussion about the accuracy or otherwise of the housing supply figures released by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. They are now officially called the connections to the ESB. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has done quite a lot of work on looking into the figures and coming up with alternative sets of figures to reflect more accurately the current degree of activity. My understanding is that the CSO will publish figures fairly soon as to the actual level of supply in the market or the level of activity in a given year. Part of the problem is that there were more than likely close to 25,000 or 20,000 housing units built last year. The issue is when these houses were actually built. Were they half-built in 2007 and then finished last year etc.? I think there will be greater clarity on this from the CSO fairly soon. What we are looking at is the trend in respect of the level of activity, and one can clearly see there is an upward trend. Perhaps the level is off in respect of the figures we are talking about but the trend is clearly upwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The second question the Deputy asked, if I understood it, concerned the implications in terms of capital expenditure and for the capital plan if we radically increase housing supply figures in the economy. There was an earlier question in the previous session about when we will know that the housing market is beginning to unduly influence the level of economic activity. The answer is when one sees housing supply levels significantly in excess of the structural demand estimates, which at present are in the region of 30,000 to 35,000 units. If we go back to building double that, as we were doing back in 2005 to 2008 - I think on average we were building 85,000 units per annum over those three years - we will know that the housing market is beginning to unduly influence the level of economic activity. Clearly, that is one metric that would show that things are getting out of control. Regarding the overall capital expenditure, obviously, the vast majority of those housing units will be privately built, so I am not so sure what the implications will be purely on the capital budget but it is again a matter of the extent to which the overall activity levels would start to unduly influence activity in the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I thank Professor Barrett for his presentation. I do not so much have any questions except to say I agree with a lot of what was in it. A question asked of the previous panel is whether the witnesses think the Government listens to them. One actually sees much of what is in the opening statement translated into Government policy. I was delighted to hear Dr. McQuinn talk about 2008 and 2009. If we had had that rainy day fund then, we could have invested it in social housing. As someone who was on a local authority back then and saw the withdrawal from central government funding and the knock-on effect of that, I believe it is very prudent that Government has a rainy day fund and it is broadened for adverse weather effects. People of my generation and the Chairman's generation always grew up being told to put aside a certain amount of one's wage if possible for a rainy day. This should be carried through in any policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I was delighted to hear Professor Barrett talk about gender in the workplace and some of the barriers women face to which he alluded, confidence, childcare and cost being the main ones. We are doing a lot to address that but we could probably go much further. He is right: men will apply for promotion if they reach two out of five criteria. Women like to finish a job before they go on to the next one. That is a given.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Regarding the data sources and the ESB connections, I am looking forward to the CSO figures coming out at the end of the week or next week, I think. Regardless of whether a house was built in part in 2010 and not completed until last year or this year, it is still a new house. People can argue over that whatever way they want; it still will put a properly built and sustainable roof over the head of someone who needs it.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Regarding Rebuilding Ireland, I think people forget where we have come from. I hate going back to this all the time, but it is important to put it in context.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Rebuilding Ireland is a five-year plan, and we always said it would be the middle of year two or three before we start to see that impact. The number of planning permissions being granted and planning applications going through, as well as commencement orders are increasing at a quicker rate than the last year or two, although they are not yet where we need them to be, that is, putting some confidence and viability back into the sector. It is going in a positive rather than negative direction. Members in other parties do not want to accept that and, instead, bash us on the ESB connections or other figures. When we drill down into them, progress is evident, and this does not come about on the back of a card; it has come about with proper policy, investment and communications with people who know this field.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I do not know even where to start with health. I spent yesterday and last night in an accident and emergency department with a family member and I have every respect for people who work in the emergency services given the pressure they are under. The Sláintecare report has been completed for a good while but it was a policy document that had to be handed to the Department of Health to produce a financing roadmap on where to invest over the next ten years. It is not something that can happen quickly. Proper policy and planning take time and doing something in haste sometimes brings poor results. I would rather take time where possible and get the results we want. I am a member of the housing committee, which is currently working on a policy for assisted and independent living for older people because of the projected demographics and because there are not enough options for people. We are feeding into the projected figures for people over 65. People want to stay within their community and even within a kilometre of where they currently live, if possible. We must consider such housing models to free up other houses with a knock-on effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> There is much in this and I enjoy reading these kinds of documents. I thank the witnesses for the presentation. I was going to ask about higher education as well but they are pressed for time.</p>

In more recent years, the ESRI funding model has shifted a little. Most people think we get a block of money from the Government and go off and do our own thing. It is not quite like that. Increasingly, the ESRI works on the basis of bilateral research relationships with Departments and agencies. The health worker mentioned earlier is a case in point, as we have direct bilateral discussions with policymakers on an ongoing basis, trying to work out the big policy matters and how research can inform the issues being grappled with. There is direct communication and the chance, in a sense, of being at least heard improves, whatever about being listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I will also pick up the issue of childcare, as it relates to a number of topics that have been raised. It is partly an issue relating to the gender pay gap. Many people will understand this and believe that one of the big reasons for the gender pay gap is the extent to which women are much more likely to have gaps in their career. With such a gap, it is not just that the wages will just be low but they will be lower than they otherwise would have been for a long time. Anything that can be done to facilitate more continuous work profiles would do much for the gender wage gap. I can link this to something else that I said. I mentioned in the presentation an observation about lone parent families. It is not just if we look at a point in time that lone parents and their children are more likely to be in poverty. They are more likely to be stuck in that position, and that relates to childcare. Before this committee and others, we have made the case that investment in childcare gives a sort of win-win-win across a variety of points.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> One of the worst research experiences of my life was writing on the issue of older people's housing. The ESRI wrote a paper where we tried to assess the policy proposal of moving old people from their houses to smaller houses-----</p>

          <p eId="para_195">I will be careful about this in general after the experience. The question we tried to answer in the research was whether there are hundreds of thousands of old-older people and if much housing space could be freed up. The evidence was a little mixed. Rather than the paper being reported as the ESRI investigating this policy, it was reported that the ESRI proposed this policy, and we got into serious trouble with many people. One of the crucial elements of the policy, as we mentioned in the paper, was ensuring older people can move within neighbourhoods. It is a terribly bad idea for older people to move away from their neighbourhoods. We know from increasing amounts of evidence that loneliness can be as big a killer as many of standard health issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">It is a crucial policy as there will be 1.3 million people aged over 65 in the coming years. I would like to focus on the benefits. I feel Professor Barrett's pain in describing the reaction he got. I saw a programme recently where this was discussed and it was portrayed as older people being shoved from their homes. It is purely a choice that people do not currently have at the level that we should have. It is about independence, security and the financial burden of running a house when that person might only live in three rooms of a three-bedroom or four-bedroom house. It is not that we want the house but we want to give people security and offset the loneliness factor as well. If we can centralise it there may be some way to help with home help hours and the knock-on effect of medical care that will be required. It relates to independent or assisted living within a kilometre of a person's home or community. That is where we are going with this and I welcome Professor Barrett's comments.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">The Deputy made the point about the rainy day fund being of use in 2008 and 2009. We have a housing conference next Thursday morning and we will delve into these issues in great detail. One policy lesson from the Irish experience over the past ten years especially is that whatever way we do it - that is another conversation - we must ensure a certain number of social housing units are built every year. That is a clear message. Having attended a conference in the UK recently, adding to the housing stock every year is very much felt to be required in British housing policy. If that does not happen, problems accumulate significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I will finish by tying up two themes in the debate. The first is the ageing demographic structure and the second is productivity slowdown. I recently did some work with a colleague in UCD where we looked at the long-term implications of this for growth in Europe. It has very significant implications. Our population structure is ageing but we can consider the degree to which the population structure across Europe is ageing, particularly in Germany, and the long-term forecast is staggering. When the elements are put together, it demonstrates that we seem to be on the precipice of facing a significant reduction in the growth in living standards over the next 30 or 40 years throughout Europe.</p>

It is important to note it is not wholly negative.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">My colleague and I will share a slightly shorter version the opening statement in the interests of time efficiency. We thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on budget 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> In the context of budget planning, the tax base is central to the committee’s discussion. As much as 80% of corporate tax receipts come from foreign multinationals and out of the top 100 largest corporate tax paying companies, only ten are Irish. Many domestic and international bodies have warned repeatedly and consistently of the risks to our tax base because of the concentrated nature of our corporate tax receipts. The Central Bank, IFAC, IMF, OECD and European Commission have all chimed on the matter in recent months. The consistency of the warnings on the volatility in our corporate tax receipts is matched only by the consistency of the warnings on the need to focus on Irish-owned businesses. While much work has been done on enterprise policy, the need to address the productivity of Irish companies cannot be ignored. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> The OECD has warned that the resilience of the economy hinges on unblocking the productivity potential of Irish-owned businesses, while at the same time highlighted that most of them have experienced a decline in productivity over the past decade. Several issues must be tackled if they are to succeed in challenging these and tax policy or tax administration issues will be central to making that happen. The OECD says that we need to give entrepreneurs what they need to grow their businesses and get rid of what is stunting that growth, and that, in some cases, access to finance holds individuals back from taking the step into entrepreneurialism. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The European Commission has also highlighted productivity issues. The IMF has also stressed the need for the productivity growth of Irish companies, including through greater support for innovation, and enhancing partnerships of SMEs with research institutions that would help improve productivity. Our tax policy on collaborative research and development has fundamental limitations in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_216"> A step change is needed if we are to build on the brilliance and ability of Ireland's innovators, entrepreneurs and start-up businesses. We must seek to unlock our potential. Other countries have done so with strategic intent, and so can we. Irish businesses need access to finance, and they also need help and expertise to make the right and the best strategic decisions. They need finance for capital investment, human capital, innovation and research and development that will determine their future success. The impact of policies such as the employment and investment incentive, EII, entrepreneur relief, our capital gains tax rates, the workability of the research and development regime for SMEs, and the effectiveness of our new share options regime are central to the strategic gear shift we need. </p>
          <p eId="para_217"> My colleague, Ms Gunnell, will outline in detail the issues within most of our critical business policies and tax policies. Some research findings have given us the context for why they are so critical.<b>
						</b>ESRI research on SMEs show that their investment is below what is expected. The investment gap was more than 30% in 2016 and, therefore, Irish businesses have fallen short. In addition, Irish companies remain heavily reliant on internal funds and on bank financing. Close to 75% of their investment is financed using their own funds, which is substantially above the EU average of 60%. This is relevant when one considers recent CSO reports on innovation, which highlight that a lack of internal finance is the main factor in hampering innovation activities by Irish companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The share of SMEs applying for a banking product has decreased since 2015. The interest rates being charged are well above the eurozone average. There is a need to consider alternative financing options such as venture capital and angel investment. These involve people who are willing to undertake riskier investments. It is not just about their money but about smart money. They come with the crucial ingredients that Irish businesses need and that other countries have availed of such as mentoring, global experience, international business contacts and a hands-on advisory role. While the tax system of other countries embraces angel investors, Ireland locks them out. </p>
          <p eId="para_219"> In light of Brexit, the financing constraints for SMEs are relevant. Research shows that it is likely to deter Irish companies from exporting. It also shows that companies reporting to have experienced financing difficulties are less likely to engage in exporting activities. The reasons Irish SMEs borrow give us an even deeper insight into Irish companies. According to the Central Bank, they borrow for working capital above any other reason. They are below the EU average for borrowing for fixed investment. On the other hand, German SMEs more frequently report using financing for the development of new products, hiring of employees and refinancing of obligations. It is no surprise then that among the German Mittelstand class, more than 42% of SMEs brought a product or process innovation on to the market in 2014. The OECD has warned that Irish companies need to invest more in their own research and development activities, which will drive productivity. </p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The OECD has also stressed the need for human capital. Ireland needs to think of ways to raise the capacity of businesses to implement new ideas and technologies. We know from research that managerial skills in many Irish companies are too weak to allow businesses to identify and exploit the opportunities offered by global companies and global trade on their doorstep. Wages in multinationals are 64% higher than in domestic companies and the difference is 74% in multinationals of non-EU origin. Under these circumstances, Irish SMEs have difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled workers, thereby hindering their growth and exporting potential, and, therefore, our share option regime becomes critical.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_93">
          <from> Ms Anne Gunnell<recordedTime time="2018-06-13T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_221">Against that backdrop, we cannot allow our tax regime to block what is good. We have dedicated agencies, educated talent, the ability of our people and an expanded global footprint within our diplomatic service. We must have tax policies to match that. Given the severity of access to finance for Irish business, I will first address the existing tax measures that promote investment. We have two major schemes, namely, the targeted capital gains tax, CGT, relief for entrepreneurs and the income tax incentive for individuals who invest in Irish business, known as the employment and investment incentive, EII. The backdrop to Ireland's high CGT rate makes analysis of the measures even more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> CGT is a key determining factor for investment in businesses. It can help or hinder the process. It is unquestionably the tax that matters most to investors and influences their behaviour. When we addressed the committee last year, Ireland had the fourth highest CGT rate in the OECD at 33%. France was at the top of the table. This year, President Macron, in his determined effort to attract more investment into French start-ups and tech companies, slashed the French rate to 30%, pushing Ireland into third place, 13 percentage points above the OECD median rate, a stark position considering what we are trying to do for Irish companies. Our targeted revised entrepreneur relief is important in that, to a limited extent, it helps reduce the CGT burden on the sale of a business. However, this tax measure is uncompetitive. It compares poorly with the UK, which makes London a more attractive location for the investors we badly need. The relief applies to a £10 million gain in the UK but in Ireland the gain is limited to €1 million. From the point of view of an investor, there is no competition between the two offerings. As Ms Buckley mentioned, the relief also locks out the important angel investors who invest not only money but also experience and industry expertise, which are vital factors when we consider the deficit of managerial capability in Irish business, as highlighted by the OECD. While cities such as Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and Tokyo embrace angel investors, Ireland's tax regime excludes them. The impact of this is that business angel investment in Ireland is low compared with that in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> The second financing tax measure of Irish businesses is the EII. It encourages investors to place finance in early stage and small businesses that have limited funding options. Such businesses must very often rely on finance from family and friends. The EII plays a vital role in scaling start-ups and small businesses to the next level of growth. While the scheme is welcome, there are now many blockages within it. Several design features of the scheme are barriers to investment, such as splitting the tax relief into two tranches, the annual investment limit of €150,000 and the revised connected party rules following the Finance Act 2017. The EU state aid general block exemption regulation, GBER, under which the EII operates, also has a significant impact on the scheme and adds to the cost and complexity of claiming EII. It is particularly difficult for businesses seeking to raise a second tranche of EII funding and those wishing to raise EII after having been in operation for seven years. A restrictive administrative process is stifling the use of the relief. The GBER provisions are applied retrospectively to business plans prepared before its introduction. The institute recommends that a full economic analysis of the impact of the GBER on the EII be undertaken and welcomes the consultation currently being undertaken in that regard by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> As Ms Buckley mentioned, Irish companies need the best human capital and talent to increase managerial skills, innovation and research and development capability. Given the high personal tax rates in Ireland, a workable share option scheme that can help Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, to attract talent to grow their businesses is essential. We welcome the introduction of the new key employee engagement programme, KEEP, which provides an opportunity for SMEs to compete with listed companies to attract and retain such talent. However, the scheme has limitations which could significantly impact its feasibility and, ultimately, its success in achieving its policy aim. Issues surrounding the qualifying criteria for individuals, the design of the remuneration limits and the narrow definition of a qualifying holding company under the scheme rules are creating difficulties for many SMEs in qualifying for KEEP.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Innovation is a central ingredient in the strategic plans for other countries when it comes to growing their SMEs. The link between innovation and productivity has been highlighted by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission. Ireland has an attractive research and development tax credit regime but administrative blockers are weighing heavily on its success in terms of the low take-up among SMEs. Research undertaken by the institute in 2017 found that only 35% of companies surveyed intended to use the research and development tax credit over the next 18 months, although that would rise to 62% if there were more clarity on the criteria for qualification. Of significant concern is the fact that the research and development tax credit regime restricts outsourcing and collaboration, a condition that is at odds with best practice by international standards, which actively promote outsourcing and collaboration with the university sector. In Germany, the incentives are aimed at collaboration and partnership with universities is key.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> From our submission in 2016, members will be aware that one of the key challenges in our current tax policy making process is the insufficient time available to scrutinise legislation announced in the budget. Apart from key income tax changes and other sensitive measures, we believe that tax legislation should be published for consultation in advance of the finance Bill. This could be done on an issue-by-issue basis throughout the year in the same way that consultation takes place on important policy matters such as controlled foreign company rules, share options and the tax treatment of entrepreneurs. In their 2017 report on tax certainty, the IMF and the OECD stated, "Legislative and tax policy design issues are a major source of tax uncertainty, mainly through complex and poorly drafted tax legislation and the frequency of legislative changes." Given the importance of all the anticipated complex changes to the Irish tax code over the next two years arising from the EU anti-tax avoidance directives, the mandatory disclosure directive and the Coffey review recommendations, it is imperative that we address this problem. I thank the members and we welcome their questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">On the EII, the additional documentation provided by the institute states that the cap of €150,000 is not working. The cap of £1 million on the equivalent scheme in the United Kingdom is mentioned. The institute is calling for the cap in Ireland to be raised to a similar amount. The documentation also mentions its extension in terms of the universal social charge, USC, and pay-related social insurance, PRSI. What impact would that have? There are other issues to be considered in terms of the backlog in processing the incentive. Must all elements come together for it to work effectively or should some recommendations be fast-tracked?</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> On the importance of human capital, as mentioned by Ms Gunnell, I acknowledge that the Government has spoken on the issue. The witnesses' written submission states, "The Government’s National Planning Framework also acknowledges the role of human capital, seeing it as “central to Ireland’s success and our economic and social development"." The employee share option scheme brought in by budget 2018 is one of the measures implemented by the Government to try to recognise the importance of that human capita. What impact has that had or is it too early to say?</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> A question I have asked all witnesses today regards whether we have a broad enough tax base in this country and, if not, where is the potential for us to broaden it?</p>

I ask Ms Gunnell to further tease out the criticisms she highlighted in regard to the KEEP in terms of why she thinks it is not working and what changes are needed to deliver a more satisfactory programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">On the EII, the first and foremost thing we would ask for is an economic analysis of the impact of the GBER on the EII. That is critical. The EII was brought within the regulation in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">It is causing a lot of the administrative difficulties and the backlog, because people are uncertain as to the qualifying criteria. One may have prepared a business plan five, six or seven years ago but one would have needed to see one's future investment needs at that time. The prescriptive approach and the detail required are causing some of the administrative blockers. We welcome the consultation being undertaken by Indecon on behalf of the Minister at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Deputy Jonathan O'Brien referred to the limit of €150,000. We have received feedback on this. We have a small pool of investors and some might find it difficult to get up to the level of funding required.

          <p eId="para_238">No. It is his limit. We welcomed KEEP when it came in but it has some limitations. The remuneration limits are causing difficulty, particularly the share option arm of the scheme where a share option cannot exceed 50% of annual emoluments. In the high-tech sector, companies with high potential which are in the start-up phase are cash strapped and have cashflow issues so they incentivise employees by offering a higher proportion of pay in share options with a lower proportion in salary. They will not qualify for KEEP. Also, under KEEP, an individual has to work full-time for a single company. An employee may, however, devote substantial time to KEEP company but if there is a holding company he or she may have some duties to carry out there, meaning they do not meet the test. The legislation also states that a holding company must wholly own the shares in a KEEP company and not be doing anything else. However, a holding company may have a bank account to meet expenses or to receive dividends and that causes difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Some SMEs will not have an exit or a third party sale and they may not list so they may need to create liquidity in their own shares by another employee buying the shares or the company buying back its shares but none of that is provided for in the legislation and only new shares qualify for KEEP. The scheme only started this year but this is what we are hearing at this stage about the difficulties people are encountering as they see whether they qualify.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">In our research and our analysis of what is happening in Ireland and other countries, we have seen a lot of good work and good foundations for getting our start-ups and entrepreneurs established. I refer to local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland, which give companies a lot of support, especially those that are export-ready or export-focused. We have a very well educated workforce and graduates who are the brightest and the best and, as a country, we are putting a lot of energy and effort into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> This week we are using our diplomatic embassies for expansion and trade and to reach out to the world. However, we find that key areas of our tax policy are holding us back. We do not have many tax measures. We have the EII, entrepreneurs' relief and relief for research and development, as well as the share option regime, but we must make all these work if we are to have any chance of fulfilling our potential and that of the entrepreneurs around the country who want to be a success but need financing and human capital to make it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> There was a question on the tax base. When we have a debate on a budget, it is hard to know where to get extra money from because there are many issues regarding all the taxes. We want to be fair in a very squeezed and rising property market and we do not want to punish people whose incomes may not match the valuation of their property. We are already getting a huge and disproportionate amount of money from corporate tax and personal taxation accounts for a very high percentage of our overall tax base, at around 40%. A lot of people with low to middle incomes have very low tax bills by the standards of other countries. We do a study every year of eight competitor countries and we know that we have a very low contribution but there has been much discussion about the pain people have gone through in recent years and the fact that the cost of living is very high in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Over many years of engaging with this committee and the finance committee, we have focused on the fact that we can only grow our tax base by growing the activity of our Irish enterprise. All the international agencies and bodies tell us that we cannot afford not to have the necessary resilience and not to fulfil our potential. We have a 30% investment gap so while our economy is growing, Irish SMEs are not matching it with investment and innovation and with managerial capacity building. The best way to grow our tax base is to give support to the indigenous Irish sector. The German economy does this very well, although it has been doing it for many decades. It is a very good model - if not to adopt then to adapt - and we could certainly learn a few things about expanding our tax base.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I thank the witnesses for coming before us today. We have had three different groups and they have all given us guidance. Ms Buckley echoed a point made by somebody from IFAC earlier, which was that the original idea of bringing multinationals into Ireland was to create an overspill and grow indigenous companies. We have been successful in the international sector but our indigenous SME sector still needs some work. The contribution of witnesses today will feed into our work.</p>
