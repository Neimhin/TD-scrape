#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Given the botched way in which the Government has dealt with the Immigration Bill and the way in which it has been rammed through both Houses of the Oireachtas in a short period of time, particularly given the concerns of the courts about these matters, we will oppose the Order of Business. We ask the Government to remove Nos. 2 and 3 from the Order Paper to allow more time. Yesterday evening an organisation made its concerns known to me about the wording of the Bill which was debated in the other House. As the Leader is aware, all these amendments will be grouped today so we will only be able to have discussions on grouped amendments. The matter has been badly handled by the Government. I do not blame the Leader or the Deputy Leader, but this matter has been badly handled by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the Government. We oppose the manner in which the Bill is being rammed through the House today.I thank the Leader for putting No. 4 on the Order Paper. I welcome a debate on electronic voting. Will she confirm to the House that the Minister will be here today to take questions from all Members of the House on the veracity of the electronic voting procedure? We need questions and answers, not statements. I would be interested to hear the Leader's reply in that regard. We need detailed answers to the questions we and Members on the other side of the House have about this issue because this is a cross-party matter. Will the Leader give a firm commitment to the House that an order under our Constitution is not necessary to allow electronic voting on 11 June, but that primary legislation is required? When the matter was first debated some years ago it was with a view to implementing it for a trial period. Legal advice to this side of the House and to the Government is absolutely clear in indicating that primary legislation will have to be introduced if we are to have electronic voting by 11 June. When is that legislation due to come before the House? I ask the Leader to ensure we have a question and answer session today on the important debate she has wisely placed on the Order of Business.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I raised objections to the Immigration Bill when it was first taken in the House because, as I said at the time, it is very bad to rush such important legislation. The Bill has come back to this House from the Dáil from a medical point of view in a worse state than when it left this House. Some of the recommendations in the First Schedule are contrary to international best practice and others, based on what the Minister said in the House on Committee Stage, are contrary to the recommendations of the National Disease Surveillance Centre. I strongly support the objections of Schizophrenia Ireland to the description in section 6 of the First Schedule, which looks like a description of a florid attack of schizophrenia. I second what the Leader of Fine Gael has said. We should give more time to this important legislation.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I support my colleagues. As the spouse of a psychiatrist, from nothing other than listening I am aware of how difficult it is to make a diagnosis in the area of psychiatric illness. The suggestion that immigration officers at our ports would suddenly discover a competence that professional psychiatrists do not have to diagnose psychiatric illness is a commentary on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and on the Government. This Bill gets worse as it proceeds, as often happens when a Government introduces legislation hastily, discovers what a mess it has made and tries to amend it equally hastily. The Bill cries out for a proper hearing by an Oireachtas committee which would listen to the views of everybody. Instead we are getting hasty legislation written by a Department, which as I have said often in this House believes it should not be subject to the nuisance of parliamentary scrutiny and that its job is far too important to be under the gaze of two Houses of the Oireachtas, which it believes do not understand the importance of the Department's job. We will oppose the Order of Business.No. 6 is an earlier signature motion for the Civil Registration Bill. Is this an error? I have never seen an earlier signature motion on the Order Paper for a Bill that was on Second Stage.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It will be moved when the Bill has completed all Stages here.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	How can we have an earlier signature motion for a Bill whose precise date of passing we do not yet know? I understood earlier signature motions were taken where there was genuine urgency. We do not know when this Bill will be passed and yet we already have an earlier signature motion. Are we to take it that earlier signature is becoming the routine practice of this House?

Why is an earlier signature motion on the Order Paper when we do not know when the Bill to which it refers will be passed? Who is playing games with us?Níl fhios agam cén fáth nach mbeidh ráiteasaí sa Tigh faoin Choimisinéir Teanga. Duine ana thábhachtach é i gcursaí riaracháin na tíre.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	14	For the benefit of Senators from Trinity College who have a problem with our first language, I said that we should have brief statements on the appointment of the Language Commissioner.Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the Revenue Commissioners? Twice in the past ten days, they have announced they will not prosecute anybody for breaches of the tax amnesty because they cannot get enough evidence. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that approximately 140,000 people opened illegal off-shore accounts, the commissioners cannot find any evidence that any bank encouraged them to do so. If the Revenue Commissioners are so bad at finding that sort of evidence, clearly someone else should do that part of the job for them and I would like the House to debate the issue.Will the Leader confirm that the Government press secretary has not been indemnified by the State for yesterday's libel action?
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I am interested in the response of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the fact that 2,000 tonnes of household waste, involving nine local authorities and private contractors, was found in 80 containers in Belgium. Given the degree of privatisation and semi-privatisation which is taking place in local authorities, what controls exist in respect of this activity? This waste was shipped out of the country in containers to Belgium for transhipment to India and Singapore. It was destined for recycling and described as "paper". However, when the containers were opened, smelly, rotten household waste was found. In this context, it is hypocrisy when we talk about recycling. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come before the House to clarify what controls exist in this regard?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I imagine the House would like to congratulate the Government on the success of its negotiations on EU funding. It is a very important development which also indicates that we must now proceed with major infrastructural projects like the metro. Therefore, we must first congratulate the Government and then act on the development.I am surprised nobody has raised the nasty item on the front page of The Star newspaper. A young woman who is employed as the Government press secretary took a libel action — to which she is perfectly entitled, although perhaps she was foolish to do so — and the court found against her. The whole front page of the newspaper has a headline which reads: “Oh Mandy”, the words of a pop song — “They sent you away and now you must pay” — and a photograph of a cheque which reads “Mandy's bank — pay The Star loads of money”.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I am indicating a context forsomething I really want to say. A number of editors were asked a series of questions on the wireless today and not only did they continue to gloat in a most obscene manner, they went on to demand that this House and the Lower House pass Bills further weakening the position of individuals. It is not enough that the whole newspaper empire should crucify one individual, it now wants the libel laws weakened. I warn this House against such a thing.This is the "sensitive" newspaper whichtelephoned me at home ten or 15 years ago to find out if I could confirm that I was dying of AIDS. Those are the kinds of people we are dealing with. I strongly advise this House to consider and reflect upon whether it should weaken the rights of the individual, including those in public life. An individual may have to take his or her chance in court, but he or she should not be bullied and crucified in this obscene manner when he or she is already distressed. It is absolutely outrageous.Regarding the Immigration Bill, we as working politicians and representatives of the people should be aware of the kinds of things with which Irish citizens married to people from abroad have to put up. I received a letter from a woman in Kildare who, with her husband, has to report every so often, even though she is heavily pregnant and she faces abuse. In the same post I received a letter from somebody who signed it just "Mags" — in the usual courageous way — drawing my attention to a letter in The Irish Times which was anti immigration and saying: “Don't go pushing your opinions on everyone, we are all tired and sick of these people. Send home the freeloaders.”

We should have been given a proper opportunity to discuss these kinds of important issues in this House because, in the absence of a proper ventilated debate, this is the type of ignorant behaviour that is going on in this country.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to the House for a debate on the most recent report on driving test delays? As Members will be aware, the average waiting time throughout the State is 32 weeks. In some centres, people have to wait more than 12 months for a driving test.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I support Members who expressed dismay at the way in which the Immigration Bill is being dealt with in this and the other House. It is reprehensible of the Minister and the Government to deal with the Oireachtas in such a shoddy fashion on such important legislation, given that the previous legislation was before the courts on a couple of occasions. I guarantee that this will go before the courts again. Shame on us and on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if that happens.The Cathaoirleach has advised Members on a number of occasions to raise issues on the Adjournment. I did so last week but the Minister of State's speech in reply was the very same as the reply to a Deputy last December. That is absolutely disgraceful.

I say this not just as a parliamentarian in this House, but as the general rapporteur regarding the media for the Council of Europe, in which theCathaoirleach had a very distinguished role. There is genuine concern in Europe about what are mainly inventions or interpretations of what is supposedly coming out of Government. It would help to clarify the issue if the Minister came to the House to debate the libel laws, an area with which he said he intends to deal. It is important that he should do it in this House, notwithstanding the right of any Minister to explore various aspects of proposed legislation outside the House.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I join with Senator Finucane in highlighting today's reports on the export of domestic waste. The time has come for us to discuss waste management and I ask the Leader to arrange for such a debate. There are many myths surrounding this matter, so a debate in the House would be useful to outline clearly the overall policy on waste management.I also join with Senator Norris in congratulating the Government on the anticipated changes to the Stability and Growth Pact. It is certainly music to my ears, given that this has been the impediment to progress on the school of music project in Cork.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I thought the Senator was against Government expenditure.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Another so-called puppy farm was discovered last week in the midlands, where dogs were found in absolutely appalling conditions. Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government when he intends to introduce proper legislation to regulate the size of cages that dogs are kept in, and the minimum hygiene and environmental conditions that dog breeders should be required to provide? What we saw on our television screens in recent weeks was appalling. Sizeable fines, if not terms of imprisonment, should be included under the provisions of new legislation governing the keeping of dogs.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House for a debate on radiotherapy services? In the past, support has come from all sides of the House for a radiotherapy unit in Limerick to cater for the mid-west region in general. I understand the Minister met a deputation last week and it has been reported widely in the press that it received a positive response. At a time when there is surplus funding for health board staff, it is only right and proper for the Minister to clarify the situation in this House.

It is important for us to recognise the great work undertaken by such people who have taken up 47,000 visas to come here. They have assisted us by working in many sectors, including tourism and agriculture, particularly in beef processing and mushroom cultivation. At a time when intemperate remarks have been made by the Opposition about the Immigration Bill, we should recognise the contribution that many migrant workers are making to our society.

The earlier signature motion regarding the Civil Registration Bill should not have appeared on today's Order Paper. It was included in error. I do not draw up the Order Paper but I wish to explain that is why I did not include the motion in what I said earlier. The Member is quite right to have noticed that.Senator Brian Hayes said the Immigration Bill 2004 was rushed. It finished in the Dáil on Thursday evening, and despite being importuned to take it earlier this week, we left it until today on the basis that would leave three working days and a weekend for further consideration. None of us is happy about the matter, but that is the situation. We can provide more time, however. I notice that it runs into the sos, and for once I believe that it would do no harm to stagger it so that people can go out or come in as they wish. The Leader of the Opposition has every right to request a vote on the matter. If more time is sought, I can offer that. Perhaps the leaders will let me know if they wish to take that up.Regarding electronic voting, I am assured that Deputy Gallagher, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will deal with questions on the floor of the House if required. The Senator also said that a ministerial order was not sufficient and requested primary legislation, as well as questions and answers. If I have deciphered matters correctly, the Minister will be prepared to take questions and answers, and the issue in question can form the subject matter of some of those.Senator Henry also raised the Immigration Bill 2004, particularly the interpretation of diseases, which she understands not to be correct. I bow to her medical knowledge on that matter. Senator Ryan said more time was needed for the Immigration Bill 2004. I have offered the sos, and I wait to hear from the leaders on that.I answered the question on civil registration, and I regret that it was on the Order Paper when not required.We are all delighted that the Language Commissioner has been appointed as laid out in the legislation. We recently had a very good debate in the House as Gaeilge agus as Béarla on the all-party motion regarding recognition of Irish in the European Union. I have no difficulty, if the Senator wishes, perhaps for a short period tomorrow or early next week — again, the leaders might let me know what would suit them — with having a debate on the appointment of the Coimisinéir Teanga. Senator Ryan praised him in his statement and also called for a debate on the Revenue Commissioners. I do not know if the Government indemnified the press secretary; I very much doubt if it did.Senator Finucane raised the question of the container in Belgium, which was supposed to have contained paper but turned out not to. I feel rather bad that our dirty waste is going all over the world when we have to come to some business arrangement for dealing with our own. The waste was dirty and smelly, but we created it. The sooner we implement full-scale arrangements for the disposal of our waste — as the Minister is endeavouring to do — the better. Clearly, shunting it all over the world is not a good idea. We now realise that tip heads, as we call them, are not a good idea either, certainly from a health point of view.Senator Norris raised the EU decision; I was waiting for someone to do so. It is marvellous, since it means that major infrastructural works can be carried out without impinging on the Stability and Growth Pact. Senator Minihan is clearly ready to blow the trumpet, and he is right. For a long time, he has been pressing about Cork School of Music, as has Senator Norris about the metro. It takes that barrier away. Senator Norris also spoke about gloating in a certain newspaper. I hate gloating about anything. If one is right, one should feel a sense of satisfaction, and if one is wrong, one hangs one's head for a while. However, I hate gloating, which is an awful characteristic in anyone. The Cathaoirleach has ruled that we are not to talk about a certain newspaper.The Senator spoke about the Immigration Bill as well. He mentioned getting anonymous letters. If a letter is anonymous, I just tear it up and do not read it. I have saved myself a huge amount of annoyance over the years. If a person does not see fit to put their name to a letter, it would give one a headache for a half an hour if one was to read it. My late father told me never to read anonymous letters and that if someone has something to say, he or she will put their name to it and that if he or she does not, it is not worth reading. I offer that advice to budding, upcoming politicians — throw such letters away.Senator Bannon called on the Minister for Transport to deal with the driving test delays. The Cathaoirleach was wise when he said that could be taken as an Adjournment debate or in Private Members' time. It is tailor-made for such debates. Senator Terry spoke about the Immigration Bill and complained about the Adjournment debates. The Cathaoirleach said he has no control over who is put forward to respond to those debates. Senator Mooney spoke about the statutory press council but, apparently, that is not wanted either. It would be a good idea if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, came to the House to outline his thinking on libel laws as this matter is evolving.Senator Coghlan painted a picture of me going from hotel to hotel throughout the country, but I do not do so. I go to Kerry.

The Senator called for a debate on the Aer Rianta hotel chain and I will endeavour to organise one. Senator Minihan spoke about waste management and the school of music. He should rush in now with renewed proposals. Senator Cummins spoke about the provisions for the size of cages for dogs. I think that is already covered by legislation, but I will inquire about it.Senator Brennan continually raises the issue of the radiotherapy unit for the mid-west, as does Senator Finucane because it is his area. I am sure the Cathaoirleach would raise it if he could speak up. Of course, he can talk; I am not saying he cannot. We will give him permission to raise it.

There is a large mushroom enterprise outside Athlone where over 100 Latvians are employed. They are doing great work for a good employer who is paying good money and they are giving a good return. A debate on that issue would be good.

This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated a list of the proposed groupings. Senators may speak only once on each group. I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	76	This group of amendments comprises amendments Nos. 2, 9, 16 and 26. It addresses an issue which generated a considerable amount of debate in the Seanad when it last considered this Bill. It is now proposed to take a technically different approach to the question of a health-related basis for refusing leave to land. Amendment No. 26 provided for a new Schedule to the Bill. In the intervening period since the time the Bill was last before the House, the opportunity has been taken to reflect again on the best approach to this question. I trust Senators will agree that the outcome is a rational solution.To place this in its historical perspective, the Aliens Order 1946 sets out health criteria for the refusal of leave to land which include references such as "lunatic", "idiot" and "mentally deficient" — terminology that now sounds horribly stigmatising and is thoroughly unacceptable. In 1972, following our accession to the EEC, provisions in respect of our obligations regarding free movement of persons and regulations were duly made under the European Communities Act 1972. In 1975 an amending Aliens Order made extensive changes to the 1946 order, including the adaptation of some provisions relating to the free movement of persons regime for general application. The old and now offensive-sounding provision was replaced with one that drew on the annex to Council Directive 64/221/EEC, which deals with limitations on the right to free movement between member states.The effect was to insert into the Aliens Order a new schedule of what were described asdiseases and disabilities, reflecting theterminology of the directive and mirroringprecisely the list of conditions set out in the annex to that directive. The directive, made in 1964, is still in effect. Thus, since 1975 there has been a uniform basis for determining if, on health grounds, a non-national should be admitted to the State, whether that person is a national of an EU state or otherwise. The simplest and fairest option is to have the same criteria for both. That is the combined effect of Governmentamendments Nos. 9 and 26. They also do so in a manner that does not use inappropriate terminology.Arguments have been made in some quarters, including in the other House, that there should be no optional power for an immigration officer to refuse a person on health grounds where that is appropriate. However, refusal on health grounds has in the past been rarely employed and I see no reason for any great change in that pattern in the future. We cannot have a situation where, were there to be an outbreak of a disease identified by the World Health Organisation as a danger to the public, immigration officers could not keep this disease out of Ireland. We would be failing in our duty to society if we were to go down that road. It would not be in the public interest to leave Ireland, alone among countries in the world, defenceless against such an outbreak. Nor do I think it is wise for us to have a more restrictive regime in place curtailing the free movement of EEA nationals, who have rights backed up by the treaties, than is the case for non-EEA nationals, whose position is that of a person seeking a concession rather than asserting a right. These amendments represent the fairest and simplest option.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	77	As the Minister of State knows, I objected to this part of the Bill from the start. This is not because I want him or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to fail in their duty to the State. There is a public health issue involved. All countries must be in a position to close their borders to certain people whom they think may be carrying a communicable disease which could result in a serious public health problem. However, we should try to bring these regulations in line with what is currently considered best practice in medicine. While it is commendable that we have got rid of the language in the Aliens Order, it would be a good idea to try to ensure we are right up to date with medical teaching on these issues.In general, if there is a communicable disease in some part of the world which is causing great worry about its spread to this country — which can be rapid, thanks to international air transport — best practice is usually to decide that nobody from that country can come here until the outbreak is under control. If there is an outbreak of smallpox in Outer Mongolia, nobody from Outer Mongolia will be allowed into Ireland until the outbreak is under control and Irish people are advised that if they go to Outer Mongolia they will have a great deal of difficulty in returning. None of the changes that have been made to the First Schedule of the Bill address the issue this way. For example, the First Schedule refers to "diseases subject to International Health Regulations for the time being adopted by the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organisation". These diseases are plague, cholera and yellow fever. Whatever about plague and cholera, yellow fever is most unlikely to become a problem in Ireland because there is no suitable vector to spread the disease. The international health regulations are currently being assessed by the WHO in terms of being updated and will be reported on in 2005. We are introducing legislation that is of little practical use to us.The next disease referred to is "tuberculosis of the respiratory system in an active state or showing a tendency to develop". I do not know how, without an X-ray, somebody can diagnose this at ports or airports. The Minister of State will say that it happens rarely. However, why put such a provision into the legislation when it is internationally recognised as being of little value? In this week's British Medical Journal, there is an article from a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on this topic. The article states that one cannot rely on the fact that one will exclude people if one specifically pinpoints countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis. This is a complex problem. I understand from the Minister's speech in the Dáil that he is relying on a person to give medical details — which should be confidential — over the telephone to him that an individual travelling to Ireland has tuberculosis. The person should be stopped at the port of origin. The chance of spreading the disease on the aeroplane is much more likely than when the person gets to this country. It is a dereliction of duty to the Irish people if one waits till the person has landed.The next disease is syphilis. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a chivalrous and gracious speech in the Dáil about how he wanted to protect Irish women from being infected by promiscuous carriers. He said:The carrier of such a condition could be somebody one would not want to come to Ireland because of his irresponsible attitude and the fact that he had infected five, ten or 15 women in a particular place.However, the latest information on syphilis in this country was published on 14 January 2004 in Medicine Weekly. It was a synopsis of the National Disease Surveillance Centre's report on syphilis in this country. The article pointed out that between January 2000 and December 2001, 595 new cases of syphilis in this country were notified to the centre. More than three quarters were male and 60% were men who had sex with men. One fifth of those had contracted the disease abroad. These were Irish nationals bringing the disease in from London, Manchester and Amsterdam where there were epidemics of the disease. I wonder how helpful it will be to the nation to be screening non-nationals for this disease at the point of entry. It seems that this is being written into the legislation for the sake of it. The association between syphilis and HIV infection is well-known, but it is left out. It seems to be on the same level as the infectious and contagious parasitic diseases, in respect of which special provisions are in operation to prevent their spread from abroad. What are the special provisions? The most likely disease is giardia and I do not know if there are any special provisions relating to it. I cannot help but wonder if the Minister took any advice from the Department of Health and Children or the National Disease Surveillance Centre.In the Dáil, the Minister spoke about SARS, which caused a great deal of trouble last year when we nearly had to bar people coming to the Special Olympics. Personally, I was glad they were all able to attend. He said:Likewise in cases of communicable diseases, such as SARS and other types of conditions, if the situation arises that we have to deal with these types of infections, somebody will have to make decisions and the Bill provides for medical inspectors to be appointed in addition to back up the immigration officers in certain cases. I am very clear in my mind that it is responsible to provide protection of this kind and it would be irresponsible to tear it down in a hallucinatory moment [which comes into the last bit of the Schedule] in Parliament in the belief that by doing so we were being somehow compassionate. There is nothing compassionate about exposing people to SARS if one can avoid it.What the Minister is doing is in contradiction of what the National Disease Surveillance Centre has suggested if there is a problem with SARS entering the country. Although the Bill does not specify, I presume the medical officer will be a public health medical practitioner. Currently, there is an outcry over the lack of 24 hour cover by public health specialists. These are the very people who would be expected to assist theimmigration officer. The Minister for Health and Children is attempting to establish an all-European body to look at these issues in a much more comprehensive way. The public health doctors have said that they welcome the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. David Byrne's advocacy that each member state should have a 24 hour, seven day a week cover for threats from infectious diseases. It is extraordinary that this legislation requires such cover, yet we do not have it. It strikes me as being half mad.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes that an immigration officer will have the back-up of a public health medical officer, if he can get one. However, the following are the guidelines outlined in the interim guidance for aircraft cabin staff on management of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome:In-flight care of suspected case of SARS: If a passenger on a flight from an affected area becomes noticeably ill with a fever and respiratory symptoms, the following action is recommended for cabin crew:1. The passenger should be, as far as possible, isolated from other passengers and crew.2. The passenger should be asked to wear a protective (surgical) mask and those caring for the ill passenger should follow the infection control measures recommended for cases of SARS.3. A toilet should be identified and made available for the exclusive use of the ill passenger.4. The captain should radio ahead to the airport of destination so that the local director of public health can be alerted to the arrival of a suspected case of SARS.5. On arrival, the ill passenger should be placed in isolation and medically assessed.The guidelines continue on the management of contact with the ill passenger:If the immediate medical assessment of the ill passenger excludes SARS as a possible cause of his or her illness, the passenger should be referred to local health care facilities for any necessary follow up. If however, the initial medical assessment conducted in the airport concludes that the passenger is a suspect or probable case of SARS the following action should be taken:1. All contacts of the ill passenger should have already been identified during the flight. For the purposes of air travel a contact is defined as:Passengers sitting in the same seat row or within at least 2 rows in front or behind the ill passenger.All flight attendants on board.Anyone having intimate contact, providing care or otherwise having contact with respiratory secretions of the ill passenger.Anyone on the flight living in the same household as the ill passenger.If it is a flight attendant who is considered to be a suspect or probable SARS case all the passengers are considered to be contacts.The guidelines continue to give more information as to what cabin staff should do about other passengers. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to refuse them entry and put infected persons back on a return flight. There is nothing in the legislation that says otherwise that they are to be refused entry. An immigration officer will be there at the point of entry and that is what he will have to look at.Drug addiction is another criteria. We have as much in the way of drug addiction as any other country, so why we are deciding to refuse people entry on these grounds is beyond me.Those working in psychiatric medicine to whom I have spoken have objected strongly to the last part of the Schedule. The Department did not contact anyone in that field to whom I spoke, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, about including this section in the Bill. Schizophrenia Ireland is dismayed because this is virtually a description of someone in a florid attack of schizophrenia. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking and disorganised behaviour. This is exactly the type of person who is to be excluded from entry here rather than being taken into care and given proper treatment. This is such a retrograde way of looking at disease, mental and physical, that I cannot support its inclusion in the Bill.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I expressed the view on Second Stage that I could not understand how the word "disability" had appeared in the Bill as initiated and, as a result, that I would not be able to support it. There was a generally negative reaction to the use of the word in the Bill. The legislation was amended in this House, for those of us who were here, and a narrower definition was inserted, under the Mental Health Acts. That too was reviewed in the Dáil and has been further refined and changed. We need to be aware that this is a justice Bill, not a health Bill. While technical medical dimensions arise, the reason for the Bill is a High Court judgment concerning documents.The explanatory memorandum stated that the changes were minimal. I do not see how the operation of the Bill will change. There was only one reason for bringing it before us and it has had to be amended. I said that the amendment made in the Dáil in respect of section 4 and the inclusion of the Schedule, as brought before this House, was a reasonable way of dealing with the matter. It is curious that there is a desire to regulate people leaving their countries, but not coming into this country; different standards apply. The Government has a duty of care to its citizens. Everybody agrees there must be some level of protection, including Schizophrenia Ireland which recognises the critical need for such legislation. It acknowledges the Minister's hard work in a letter to him of 9 February 2004, which was also circulated to Members.The need for the legislation is accepted but the question arises of how to define the limited circumstances under which someone might be refused entry. Major infectious diseases regulated by the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organisation must be dealt with globally, not just within this country. These might include SARS, avian flu and so on. HIV is the cause of a serious communicable disease but are we going to say that everyone should have a blood test at the airport? I doubt that is the Government's intention. There must be some basic measure to protect the health of our citizens. Senator Henry has not suggested otherwise. She has suggested that all those infectious diseases must be dealt with.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	79	That is a practical point.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Yes. The changes are minimal which leads us to the contentious area, paragraph 6 of the First Schedule:Profound mental disturbance, that is to say, manifest conditions of psychotic disturbance with agitation, delirium, hallucinations or confusion.There must be a provision that allows people at the ports to deal with those who are violent or pose a threat to themselves or others by virtue of severe disturbance. Those words strike a reasonable balance. They are not, and will not be used as, an arbitrary device to keep people out of the country. The general line of all the arguments against this Bill seems to have been that its provisions will be used as an arbitrary system for keeping people out of the country. I cannot see how the practice will change from last week, or the week before or several weeks before that. If the Minister of State tells me it will change I would be interested, but I do not expect him to say it.Thankfully, we are a considerable distance from the time flags flew on the masts of ships indicating "Plague — keep away". I have a certain sympathy for the point of view of Schizophrenia Ireland, which is not appalled but makes some reasonable points. It refers to the common position adopted by the European Union with regard to the removal of a reference to disabilities as being logical because only diseases may justify a measure restricting freedom of movement. "Disabilities" has been removed. One cannot have a situation where one exempts everybody who comes into the country, including some who may be violent and may pose a threat to himself or herself, or to other people. This cannot be omitted from the Bill and we have to trust the discretion and good judgment of the people who are at the ports to ensure that they will act humanely and properly, as they always do.I am sure that like me many Members have visited Ellis Island in New York and seen the humiliation and fear that people, many of them Irish, had to endure when they entered the United States in the early part of the 20th century. We should never return to a system like that and modern society would not tolerate it if we tried. What has been done in the Dáil is sensible, balanced, right and should be supported.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	81	This morning's debate reveals that there is much expertise available in the Oireachtas, and particularly on Senator Henry's part, that the Minister could have used in putting this Bill through the Houses. Unfortunately, in the Seanad, that opportunity was missed because we cannot have much effect here. The Bill will go through with no changes. We have mentioned the correspondence from Schizophrenia Ireland which I received a couple of days ago. We needed the opportunity to consider that and to make a real input. We can raise points from that correspondence, but that is only going through the motions because we do not have the power to change the amendments.Schizophrenia Ireland makes the point that a new EU common position has been adopted but that the legislation is based on Directive 64/221/EEC which apparently is four decades old. The common position reflects new thinking in our society and we could have shown the lead by adopting that new position in our legislation. The Minister should consider that soon. Senator Dardis said that we must protect ourselves from people who are violent. I would have thought it much more likely that the people who might be violent or about whom we might have to worry would not display the symptoms mentioned in the legislation. Most of the violent incidents on aeroplanes or at airports, which we read about in the newspapers, are air rage incidents or involve people who have been drinking. The type of violent acts from which we must protect ourselves as a society do not involve people who are covered by the definition in the Bill. I disagree with Senator Dardis on that point.I hope the Minister will take on board what has been said here today and reconsider the definition. I welcome the fact that an amendment was made in the other House. The current legislation is better than what was originally drafted, which is welcome. However, this area must be re-examined in the near future.

I thank all Senators for their eloquent and learned contributions to this important debate. There is a fair degree of consensus on the matter. Senator Dardis summed it up well. As I stated in my initial response, a person's health status has been rarely used to refuse someone permission to land. As Senator Henry said, it will make little difference in practice. However, it is necessary in principle when drafting legislation. As regards the point that because it comes up little in practice, it is of little value, to say that something is of little value is different from saying something is of no value. There is value to it and it is necessary in principle.Senator Dardis and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, explained the background to this issue. I concede that what we are doing is introducing emergency legislation to deal with an immediate problem. As a result of the amendments we have accepted, we are putting in place the law as it was understood to be up to 22 January when the High Court made its ruling. As the Minister explained to both Houses, we are doing that on a temporary basis. We are looking at developing a more coherent, forward thinking and comprehensive immigration policy. Work on that legislation is proceeding in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Unfortunately, we have had to divert people's time, energy and resources to put this emergency legislation in place. That is regrettable because some of those people will put the more advanced legislation in place.I accept Senator Henry's point about syphilis, SARS and other communicable diseases. It is unlikely that an immigration officer would be able to conclude that someone coming in through the port of Dún Laoghaire, who is suffering from syphilis, had that disease.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The mind boggles as to how an immigration officer would find that out.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	85	On the other hand, that person may have behaved notoriously badly in another country and the notification may have been sent forward to the Irish authorities. That has happened. It is a matter of discretion for the immigration officer. The immigration provision in the United Kingdom states that an immigration officer must refuse leave to land to a person on confirmation from a medical inspector that for medical reasons it is undesirable to admit a person seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom. That covers a multitude. The immigration officer must only conclude that it is undesirable to allow a person to land. It is at his or her discretion and he or she cannot be questioned. The United Kingdom is not worried about SARS, syphilis or communicable or non-communicable diseases. It is not going into the same detail as we are. The immigration officer has total discretion to refuse a person leave to land. Even with this emergency legislation we are putting through today, our regime is infinitely more liberal.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	It is totally impractical.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	87	If we adopted the United Kingdom's approach, which no one could argue is impractical, I am sure the Senator would have something to say about that. We cannot have it both ways.The law is now exactly as it was understood to be up to 22 January. We have adopted the same regulations for both EEA and non-EEA nationals. We are working hard in the Department to update the legislation. I think Sinn Féin tabled an amendment in the other House to the effect that there should be a 270 day time limit on this legislation. The Minister did not accept it. We were not opposed to it in principle, but we could not guarantee that the other legislation would be ready within 270 days. It might take slightly longer than that, but we hope to have it before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the middle of next year at the latest.As regards the point made about the letter from Schizophrenia Ireland, I am aware there is an EU directive in gestation. However, it has not yet seen the light of day. If it becomes an EU directive, which we would welcome, we will be obliged to transpose that into our domestic law. It relates to the psychiatric element of the issue. However, because it is an EU directive, it will only cover EEA nationals. If we introduce that law for EEA nationals, we will apply the same regulations and law to non-EEA nationals. In view of the correspondence from Schizophrenia Ireland, there is a note from the Department which I will read into the record. It states:I am aware that there is a Common Position arrived at by the EU Council of Ministers, the effect of which is that there should be a new Directive covering all aspects of the Treaty right of free movement for EU citizens, and that as part of that proposed Directive, the present Annex to Directive no. 221/64/EEC should be replaced with a considerably more succinct expression of the health restrictions on the right of free movement. I am aware that the proposed restrictions will not include reference either to drug addiction or to profound mental disturbance.I am also aware that the proposed Directive is not yet an actual Directive, and will not be unless and until the European Parliament concludes its current consideration of the matter and does so in a manner that clears the way for the making of the proposed Directive. This Bill deals with the position as it is now: it puts in place for non-EEA nationals exactly the same regime as regards health-based restrictions as at present exists for EEA nationals, restoring the position as it has been under the Aliens Order 1946 as amended by the Aliens Order 1975. This Bill makes no change to what was thought to be the law in this regard until 22 January last, when the High Court declared its statutory basis to be unconstitutional — no more and no less.If and when the Common Position develops into an actual EU Directive (which I would welcome, and hope that it will be sooner rather than later), I can assure the House that the necessary steps will be taken, as they must be, to implement that Directive in Irish domestic law. The opportunity will be taken at that stage to review the position regarding health restrictions on the entry of non-EEA nationals to the State.As I have said, the fairest arrangement, and in practical terms the simplest to operate, is that the same criteria should apply to both categories of persons; and that is the most likely outcome of that review.I would finally like to reiterate that the conditions in section 4(3)(c) are, like all of the other conditions listed in that subsection, merely a basis on which the immigration officer may exercise a discretion on the Minister's behalf to refuse leave to land. The existence of one or more of the conditions listed at paragraphs (a) to (k) is not a compulsion to refuse leave to land, merely the basis for a discretion — a discretion being exercised as a matter of daily practice frequently in favour of the incoming non-national.

The Parliamentary Counsel has had the opportunity to consider the appropriate updating of the material in the Bill regarding the privileges and immunities of diplomats, consular officers and the staff of international bodies with similar privileges and immunities. The original material in the Bill as published was drawn from section 5(4) of the Aliens Act 1935. While it would have been adequate to the purpose, it is preferable to use the modern language of amendment No. 3 making reference to the more recent statutory provisions. I thank Senators for their support in updating this.

The immigration officers will henceforth be appointed under this Bill when enacted. There are references in earlier statutes which create duties, functions and obligations on immigration officers "appointed under the Aliens Order 1946". For example the Refugee Act imposes obligations on immigration officers referred to in this way regarding the admission of persons seeking asylum into the State. This amendment puts beyond doubt that those obligations fall on all immigration officers even though they will now be appointed under this Act.

While the courts could as a matter of course read that requirement into the section, it is no harm to spell it out plainly. Section 9(4) of the Bill forms part of the mechanism for the control of non-nationals in the State. It has been the law since 1946 and complements the remaining provisions of section 9 regarding registration.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	101	We are amending the Immigration Act following a High Court decision. Why are we taking the opportunity to make other changes? Will this improve the Bill? A keeper is defined as somebody who owns a hotel or other accommodation where non-nationals are staying. How is such a person expected to keep a register of those people? Will they have to keep a register of everybody? Will the non-nationals be picked out, which could lead to confusion and embarrassment in many cases?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We have been under considerable pressure to do something far more radical than we are doing. The Senator has asked why I am taking the opportunity to make some changes. This is emergency legislation. We are considering introducing more comprehensive legislation next year. Even though it is emergency legislation, we are now incorporating the changes we can to make it more modern pending the introduction of the more comprehensive legislation next year. During the debate on this legislation various speakers in both Houses of the Oireachtas made the point that this section imposes somewhat onerous requirements particularly on those in Gaeltacht areas, or those in Tralee making a few bob by accommodating people overnight during the Rose of Tralee festival. We are trying to accommodate such people in the section. This amendment improves the Bill.People are already obliged by law to keep a register of all those staying in guesthouses, hotels or other commercial accommodation. We are changing that slightly. The practice is to register everybody including nationals and non-nationals. Now we are saying that if it transpires that they have both nationals and non-nationals and they do not register the nationals — the local people — that will no longer be an offence. I will read into the record the note from the Department, which explains the provenance of the changes.Amendment No. 19 distinguishes between lodging or accommodation being provided on a commercial basis, i.e. by a hotel or guesthouse on the one hand and that of the case of an individual sometimes perhaps an older person who would maintain a lodger and where, say, only a single room in the house would be in question. This is in order to ensure that section 10 of the Bill will not create too onerous a burden on the bean an tí in the Gaeltacht or the farmer who lets out a few rooms for the Rose of Tralee festival or the householder who keeps a lodger, but who cannot be said to be engaged on a commercial scale in the business of providing accommodation for gain.Amendment No. 19 replaces subsection 5 of the section and redefines the classes ofpremises encompassed by the section to include the concept of engaging in the business of providing accommodation on a commercial basis.Amendment No 20 ensures that the offence of failure to keep a register of non-national in accordance with section 10 will no longer be subject to arrest without warrant.

I do not dispute the need to upgrade our immigration laws. We need to protect our citizens and those coming into the country and ensure their rights are upheld and I doubt anyone on this side of the House would dispute that. However, I have reason to question the Minister's good faith on this issue.The Bill goes further than placing existing practice on a statutory footing. It introduces new concepts into Irish law which have been outlined many times to the Minister. However, I find the way in which this Bill has been rammed through the Houses most reprehensible. I think the Minister of State was present when this side of the House objected to the way in which the Bill was dealt with last week and walked out.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Perhaps it was Deputy Brian Lenihan. The Bill was dealt with in a shoddy manner in this House and in too hasty a manner in the Dáil also, which marked a low point in my time in this House. It is indicative of this Government's increasing disregard for the Seanad and it does not bode well for the future of democracy under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition. It is not so long ago that Deputy Michael McDowell was running up every lamp-post in Dublin South-East alerting all the minions to the dangers of single party Government. It seems we now have single party Government. The party which was to be the Government watchdog is indistinguishable from Fianna Fáil. Like Fianna Fáil, its purpose is to stay in power at whatever cost, as stated by the Taoiseach on Tuesday, 9 December 2003.Not so long ago in this House, the Opposition was afforded the courtesy of consultation and matters would be guillotined only with the agreement of the Opposition. There is an air of arrogance about the Government which is epitomised by the attitude of this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On his appointment, I had some hope in this Minister but he has let himself down badly. In so many ways he has failed the people. He has failed to deal adequately with gangland crime, to establish a Garda ombudsman, to establish night courts, to deliver 2,000 extra gardaí and he has failed to reform the libel laws. Instead, his answer to every problem seems to be to introduce new legislation. In doing so, he is unrelenting in his efforts to compromise the legislative process, flout Standing Orders and depart from the long-standing practice of affording some degree of courtesy to the Opposition.I propose to explain the basics of legislation because this Minister, more than any other, needs to be reminded how this democracy used to function in the days when he wrote articles for the Sunday Independent and presided in the Office of the Attorney General.Article 15° 2.1 of the Constitution provides:The sole and exclusive power for making laws in the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The Oireachtas consists of three organs, namely, the Dáil, the Seanad and the President. In order to be valid, primary legislation must be examined and considered by all three. The rationale behind this requirement is to ensure that the democratically elected representatives of the people are afforded a sufficient amount of time to give detailed consideration to every provision of every Bill. The application of the guillotine defeats this intention. The late introduction of voluminous Government amendments defeats this intention. The very actions of this Government have defeated and continue to defeat the intention of Article 15° 2.1 of the Constitution.When a Bill is forced through these Houses, it is contrary to the spirit of Article 15° 2.1. The Bill is put through each Stage in name only. A Bill which has been pushed through with the force we have seen on the Immigration Bill 2004 would be vulnerable and likely to succumb to constitutional challenge.A number of features distinguish primary legislation from secondary legislation. The main distinction between primary legislation and secondary legislation lies in the level of parliamentary scrutiny which these enactments receive. Scrutiny by the three organs of the Oireachtas is fundamental to primary legislation. Substituting secondary legislation where primary legislation is really what is required has been frowned upon by the courts.In the Liu Chang case, the courts were severely critical of the Government for purporting to give statutory weight to secondary legislation. It seems this Government is about to make the same mistake again by making an order amending primary legislation by secondary legislation in a desperate attempt to introduce electronic voting. There is little in my mind to distinguish the Immigration Bill 2004 from a piece of secondary legislation. The level of scrutiny it has received denigrates its status as primary legislation. It may become an Act, but in title only.The Laurentiu case first highlighted flaws in our immigration laws in 1999. The then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government sought to rectify those problems through section 2(1) of the Immigration Act 1999. That section was struck down in recent weeks by the High Court in the Liu Chang case. However, five years after the High Court first highlighted the problems in this area, the Minister is on his third attempt to fix the problem. Will this legislation be a case of third time lucky for the Minister? History has a habit of repeating itself. Rushed legislation makes for poor legislation. It is an abuse of the legislative process which does not solve problems but creates many more.The volume and frequency of Government amendments to this Bill is symptomatic of a greater problem. This Bill was drafted at speed with the result that every day the Bill lay in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, more errors and flaws were spotted. In the case of the controversial disability provision, one version appeared in the proof of the Bill, which was circulated to us, then the Bill initiated in the Seanad contained an entirely different disability provision and the Bill before us today contains yet another version of the disability provision. In a few days, one provision has been changed three times. This is not an isolated occurrence — many other mistakes in the Bill have been rectified and amended by the Minister. How many more mistakes will be identified when this Bill is enacted? If we were afforded proper time to consider the Bill, I have no doubt that a considered debate and constructive amendments would have ensured that it was stronger and better. I watched the Minister in the Dáil reject Opposition amendments one after another in a style more appropriate to the Four Courts. Amendments are proposed by the Opposition with the intention of improving the Bill. The Opposition is eager to ensure that the Minister gets this Bill, more than any other, right. It is in that vein that amendments were proposed. To say we are gravely unhappy is an underestimation of our opposition to the Bill. I will show my discontent by opposing the legislation when it is put to a vote.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I share Senator Terry's concerns about the manner in which the Bill has been rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Regardless of the fact that the legislation is described as temporary, we have a duty to try to make it seem that we have considered it carefully, but that has been virtually impossible to do with this Bill. I also cannot support this Bill because I do not believe the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought advice on the medical aspects of the legislation, particularly the section I addressed which is now the First Schedule. I do not believe the Department of Health and Children was adequately consulted — I do not know if it was consulted at all — and I do not think the National Disease Surveillance Centre was consulted.I have not met anyone in public health who was consulted about it and I certainly have not found anyone who could have given advice from a psychiatric point of view. The Minister of State described how broad the UK legislation is but said our Bill is better. I think the Bill is probably worse because totally impractical areas are being singled out when I have given medical evidence that can be verified which shows that these areas are considered impractical. I remember getting a work permit in the 1960s to go to the United States. As non-nationals, one had to be X-rayed, have blood taken and so forth. If we want to look for tuberculosis and syphilis by taking blood samples, that is fair enough, but there is no point singling out specific conditions in important legislation, which will be very rarely implemented. What value is it to have such conditions specified? I certainly will not be able to support the Bill.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I empathise with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, because he is carrying the can for the Minister. Equally, the other Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was in a similar position the week before last when the legislation was introduced. On previous occasions, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced legislation he spent time discussing the issues with Senators, as did the Ministers of State. It is notable that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stayed away when the Seanad was being treated very badly. Even Senator Mansergh commented that it was frankly unanswerable to rush the legislation through the Seanad because there was time available before it went to the Dáil for a more considered debate.I reluctantly walked out of the debate. I like dealing with amendments as I believe the Opposition can make a difference. The Labour Party tabled 29 of the 40 plus amendments, yet only 20 to 30 minutes was allowed for the debate on those amendments. I noted that the Leader of the House and Members on the Government benches tended to blame the Department for the manner in which the legislation was dealt with, but whereas the ultimate responsibility rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we order the business of this House and it is up to the Leader and the Members on the Government side to say "No" and to refuse to deal with legislation in that way. Deputies did so in the Dáil and I do not see why we cannot do so in the Seanad. The fact is that amendments were dealt with in the Dáil in a different way from here, although there were still complaints. Obviously, I welcome the acceptance of the points made by the Labour Party.Difficulties arose with the previous legislation because of the way it was handled. It is possible that a case could be made that the constitutional requirement to deal with legislation in a particular way was not met in this case due to lack of time. The Department and the Minister need to think about that point.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has mentioned several times that comprehensive legislation will be drafted. That is needed because emergency legislation is problematic. There needs to be adequate consultation on the proposed legislation so that everybody has an input to it. The Labour Party has no problem with legislation to control immigration, but we believe it should be fair and there should be a positive system for economic immigration. I hope that will be provided for in the legislation.I hope there will be a comprehensive consultation process and that the different points of view are accommodated, leading to greater understanding. The representatives of immigrants groups have to be consulted properly so that they too are assured of a reasonable and fair system. It will be easier to deal with racism and other issues if everybody understands that the system is fair.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I thank everybody for contributing today and on the previous debates on the Bill. In response to Senator Tuffy, it is emergency legislation and almost by definition, one's chances of wide consultation on it are slim. This is emergency legislation to deal with an emergency because, as matters stand, we have no effective and workable mechanism in place to prevent illegal immigration to this country. The emergency will continue as long as the proposed legislation is not passed. It is preferable to have a longer time to debate legislation, but the fact that it comes under the emergency heading, which we have to do occasionally, does not necessarily mean it is bad legislation anymore than if it was debated for five or six months. The Aliens Act 1999, the predecessor of this Bill, was debated in both Houses for approximately five months. It was considered exhaustively, but it was found to be defective by the courts. I agree with the Senator's main point that we need to consult widely and that is why the very extensive consultation process for the more extensive immigration Bill, which I hope will come before the Oireachtas next year, is already underway.Senator Terry stated that the Bill introduces radical changes. I do not know where the Fine Gael Party stands on the issue. On the one hand, Members complain that the Bill only restates the laws on the Statute Book, the amended Aliens Order 1946, and should have gone much further but, on the other, Fine Gael spokespersons say the Bill is going much further. The Government's intention is to put what was in secondary legislation into primary legislation, to put it in the Statute Book to satisfy the requirements of the High Court judgment in the recent case of 22 January 2004. In doing so, we have made those changes that we found it possible to make in the short time available to us. For example, we have taken out some of the more offensive terminology, which is now a relic of history. We have made a few very minor changes to the Bill. As I said, it would be ludicrous to get into the more radical changes about which we are now consulting before the consultation process had taken place. If we were to make extensive changes at this stage, within the short time available, that would be extremely risky. The most substantial change from the old system is that provision is being introduced into Irish law to enable the charging of fees for immigration services, which is fairly non-contentious.Senator Terry said that disregard was being shown for the Seanad. I come here quite often to deal with the minutiae of legislation, and I have the highest regard for this House. How the House manages its business is essentially a matter for it. I do not want to get into a major debate about how time is taken up in the other House by people who are calling for more time to debate legislation. I do not want to be contentious on that matter today.Once again, I thank Senators for their contributions. It was mainly as a result of contributions made in the Seanad that the Bill, which one hopes will be passed by this House today and sent to the President for signature, is better than that with which we started off. That is the function of Parliament.

On the Order of Business this morning I stipulated the length of time for speakers. We cannot override Members' rights for the sake of what is now thought to be a very good idea of the Minister of State's. There may be Senators who will speak at length and those who may not. I stipulated the time allowed for spokespersons, for those sharing time and for Members who are supplementary speakers to the spokespersons. I can do no more.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I welcome this opportunity to discuss the introduction of electronic voting and counting at the European Parliament and local elections next June. In the short time available to me, I wish to reply to some of the points put forward by opponents of the system. I stress that the system that will be used is secure and reliable. It can be trusted by the people. It has been in use for over ten years in the Netherlands, for some years in parts of Germany, at pilots in the United Kingdom and at two polls in this country in 2002. It has recently been approved for use in France, where it will be used for the first time in Brest in March and in several locations at the European Parliament elections in June. Governments, Opposition parties and the public in such countries would not and do not operate a system which is insecure or unreliable. Their democracies are not damaged or reduced by the use of the electronic voting system. What is so peculiar to this country that a similar system cannot operate satisfactorily here?The voting machine hardware and software that will be used have been rigorously tested on two occasions. They were tested in 2002, before the pilot use of the system, and again last year, following the modification of the voting machine to make it easier for voters to use and the addition of further security features. The German institute, PTB, stated in its report that the software accurately records the votes cast. One could not get a more definite assurance than from such an internationally accredited testing institute. Would the institute certify in writing the adequacy of the software if it was not satisfied with its structure and accuracy? Its report is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Internet at www.electronicvoting.ie. While our current system has worked well, one does not hear alarming stories about the security of ballot papers in a ballot box and the opportunities that exist to interfere with such a box. It would be much easier to interfere with a paper ballot than to interfere with a vote recorded in a ballot module.The system's reliability and acceptance has been proven by its record over the years in other countries and in our pilot polls — in the Dublin West, Dublin North and Meath constituencies in the 2002 general election and in seven constituencies in the Nice treaty referendum a year later. Successful use at all types of polls is the real reliability test, in my opinion.Returning officers will apply rigid accesssecurity procedures at all stages of the election sothat only authorised staff will have access to the voting machines and the PCs to be used. Security concerns have been raised in respect of the use of PCs. These concerns have been exacerbated by the weekly news of viruses attacking computer systems. We discussed the arrangements for the PCs with experts from two leading companies in the PC and software areas, who expressedsatisfaction with our plans. New election-specific PCs will be supplied to returning officers after they have been security hardened with the software necessary for the election loaded on them. It will not be possible to load other software onto the PCs during the election period. Staff authorised by the returning officer will have access to the PC. There will be specific security access procedures to log in to the PCs, which will be under the control and direction of the returning officers at all times. The voting machines and the PCs will not be linked to a network, internally or externally. This means that hacking and virus attacks will not be possible due to the strict security protocols that will be in place.I wish to deal with two issues raised by some opponents of the system. There has been an increasing chorus for the addition of a voter verifiable paper audit trail. I sometimes wonder if its proponents understand the system we propose. Do they accept in an uncritical manner the information provided by some individuals? The proponents of a such an audit trail come mostly from the US. Their arguments arise primarily from concerns about some voting machines used in that country. It is necessary to understand that there are many different types of voting machines, some of which are good and some not so good. The Nedap voting machine is not of the same type as the US machines in question, however. Its reliability is confirmed by its successful use in the Netherlands and in parts of Germany for many years and by international accredited testing institutes. We need some reality here. We should compare like with like. People should not accept everything that is handed to them. We should be guided by the past use of the voting machine as well as its reliability here and in other countries for many years and its testing by internationally accredited testing agencies.Those who argue in favour of a paper audit state that the voter will see, in paper format or by means of an image on a screen, choices made on the voting machine and recorded automatically before pressing the "cast vote" button. It is argued that a paper copy should be available to check later if there is a dispute about voting machine reliability. Certain facts are relevant in that regard. The US machines are generally PC based. The Nedap voting machine, which is a proprietary product produced specifically for voting, has been used for many years in other countries without any doubts about its reliability. The machine, including software for storing votes, has been tested by the German national testing institute and certified so that it accurately stores votes as cast.Ballot papers are visible on the screen of the Nedap machine. Voters see preference numbers beside candidates' details. Preference details are visible on the bottom line of the display screen as voters record their preferences on the machine. Details are confirmed or may be amended before the "cast vote" button is pressed. The paper trail procedure does not have any advantages in this regard. When a paper trail is in place, voters must trust that the software will record, in the storage device used, the preferences recorded after the "cast vote" button has been pressed. Under the proposed system, the control unit operator can confirm that a vote is stored and the number of votes stored can be checked on the control unit screen.Printers can be unreliable, especially in high volume circumstances. What happens if a printer breaks down on polling day? Will voting have to be suspended? If some votes do not have a paper copy, the rechecking objective is negated. A task force which considered this matter in California, which included representatives of the electronic industry and election officials, could not reach a consensus on the use of a paper trail. The task force highlighted technical problems with the use of printers as a major obstacle. In the Irish context, printed ballot papers could raise issues about the secrecy of the ballot, as a link between voter and printed ballot paper could be established.Ballot papers printed at the time of voting and used in a manual count later would not give the same precise result as the electronic count due to the mixing of ballot papers. This would negate one of the main reasons for a paper trail. In fairness, this was recognised in the Labour Party's report on electronic voting. In an election petition, the system can print a ballot paper for each vote cast after the mixing of the ballot, thus enabling a manual count to be conducted. I am happy to rely on the proven record of the system in other countries and the certification by international testing institutes rather than automatically reacting to some doubts raised about different types of PC-based voting machines used in the USA.People have mentioned the possibility of making available the source code to the public. The Minister has indicated he will review this issue, taking account of the security of the system and secrecy of the ballot. It should be noted that very few countries make election source code publicly available because of security concerns.Another area in which mischief was deliberately spread last week related to the matter of the so-called right to spoil one's vote. It has never been a purpose of electoral law or administrative arrangements to provide a facility for people to spoil their votes. The primary and essential function of an electoral system is to allow people to choose their public representatives. The electronic voting system is rightly designed to facilitate this rather than to collect and register protest votes. However, the legislation took particular care to protect the privacy of a person choosing not to press the "cast vote" button. Detailed practical guidance on these provisions will be included in the general guidelines that will be issued by the Department in connection with the June 2004 elections. If people are disaffected by the political system, while one would not advocate abstention, they are free not to vote. Alternatively, a person may attend at a polling station, be marked off the register of electors, approach the voting machine and leave without pressing the "cast vote" button. In this case the machine will be deactivated and it will record the occurrence for inclusion in the election statistics. It is not necessary to communicate with the polling station staff in this regard; one must simply walk away from the voting machine.This country has adopted a cautious and sensible approach to electronic voting. The proposal to introduce the system has been in the public domain since 1998. We can hardly be accused of rushing after six years. We have successfully piloted the system at real polls. It is now time to move on, having secured a trustworthy system and validated and verified its ability to store and count votes securely. In introducing it in Ireland, the approach was to use an electronic voting system of proven and robust performance. This is what we have done and we have procured a system that comes with its own proprietary hardware and software and has enjoyed the proven advantage of wide-scale and successful use in other democracies. This successful operation in practice, in some of the most sophisticated societies in the world, is the most worthwhile possible test of reliability. The public has rightly always had confidence in the people who administer our elections and it is important to remember that these people will continue to administer our elections. This time they will have the benefit of a system which will eliminate human error in voting and counting to assist them. It is a system which will, more closely than any before, ensure that the results it declares reflect the exact intent of the voters.The education and awareness campaign the Minister launched last week will employ a range of measures including TV, radio, Internet and poster advertising, countrywide roadshows and direct mail. Each element of the campaign has been developed in light of the experience of the 138,000 voters who used the system at the general election and the 270,000 who used it at the referendum in 2002. Its purpose is to inform voters about the system and how to use it and to provide opportunities for members of the public to acquaint themselves with it before polling day. It includes the largest series of information demonstrations ever undertaken by the Department, with a total of 120 full-day roadshow demonstrations of the new voting machine taking place. This will touch on every part of the country. Briefing sessions will be held with local media and candidates. Information materials will be available to anybody interested, ranging from answers to basic questions to details of technical features. The campaign will also have another significant element beyond making people familiar with the new system. It will include a module to encourage people to vote, a measure which I hope we can all support.The move to electronic voting and counting is progressive and responsible. We are using well tested equipment and software which has been subject to rigorous independent examination. I hope the Opposition Members will, while retaining their reservations about the new system, join with the Government in implementing and supporting it for the benefit of the voter rather than creating doubts among members of the public.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I always found the Minister of State to have a good grasp of local and national government. I regret that he is in the passenger seat rather than the driving seat, but it is to be hoped his time will come.With Ireland holding its own at the top level of the European information technology sector, the introduction of electronic voting is to be welcomed as a logical and essential way forward. Fine Gael is fully committed to such progress, but in this case we are advocating progress with caution. The electronic system the Government is pushing to implement is unfortunately dangerously flawed, with many questions still to be answered. It is not up to the standard demanded by our democracy. We would like all aspects of the system to be referred to an electoral commission.Fianna Fáil and the PDs have forced through approval for such a system before the next local and European elections through sheer weight of voting numbers at committee level. The system that has been approved is still subject to numerous doubts in the area of security. The move was vigorously opposed by Fine Gael and other members of the Opposition on the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. One of the principal grey areas for the Opposition is the fact that the Government — through the Department whose political head is the director of elections for Fianna Fáil, namely, Deputy Cullen who unfortunately is not here today — is implementing a system in which the other parties have little confidence. Last week, to add insult to injury, an explanatory leaflet for the system, part of an expensive PR exercise by the Government, gave a clear message to the electorate to vote Fianna Fáil. Was it subliminal advertising or blatant manipulation of the system? Either way, the effects are the same. These leaflets have now been withdrawn due to pressure from Fine Gael.Last week in the Mansion House I was given a demonstration by one of the Minister of State's senior officials on the electronic voting system. I went into the booth and cast my vote for the town council and for the county council. After a minute the demonstrator called on me to vote in the European elections. I replied that I could not. She told me to press the button, but again I said I could not. It was only when she came around and inspected my ballot paper that she realised Fine Gael was not included. This is a total infringement of the secrecy of the ballot, which I hope will not carry over into every polling booth throughout the country. The omission of Fine Gael was no accident. The Minister of State has repeatedly told us that electronic voting is tamper-proof and idiot-proof, but is it Fianna Fáil and PD-proof? We have experience of the many promises made by the Government in the run-up to the last election. The people, therefore, are not entirely confident with the Government. The report compiled by Zerflow Holdings Limited, which the Minister of State did not publish, emphatically states that the system is not tamper-proof. This report was in the Minister of State's hands before the last election, yet the system was partially used in a number of constituencies. As we are dealing with a Government with a track record that does not inspire feelings of trust, it is necessary that there is full transparency and information on this issue before we proceed.It is unfortunate that voters must assume that errors in the system are likely. I am continually asked for assurances that the system is safe, yet what guarantees can I give? In theory, it is possible to programme the computers to check votes for a particular party and change these votes for another party. Such a system could transfer every fifth vote. The bottom line is that the system is open to intentional manipulation.It is impossible to verify the safety of the proposed system because the Government has refused to publish the system's source code for a transparent public audit. It is not enough for the Minister of State to be satisfied with the system as planned. At worst, it poses a real threat to democracy and leaves a question mark over its efficiency.The other areas of concern with the proposed system are the serious delays in the development of the software, the small team of experts involved, including some from the Fianna Fáil Party ranks, and no public scrutiny for the implementation of the statutory counting rules. The process used for testing and modifying the software was not carried out in accordance with best practice. There is a minimum-to-high risk that the system will fail if put into service in the June 2004 elections. The IES computer program to count the votes is still in a state of flux. Some 30 changes have taken place from version 83 in January 2002 to version 115 in September 2003. This indicates the Department and the developers, through the tests, are still changing requirements and finding bugs on a regular basis. It begs the question as to when, if ever, the system will be totally reliable.If the proposed system is not behaving as one would expect, whether by accident or malicious tampering, the effects on the voting outcome might never be detected. The system must be modified so that a paper record can be made of every vote cast. These records can be used for spot-checks or recounts. As the playwright Tom Stoppard said: "It is not the voting that is democracy, it is the counting."

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Government has claimed that a paper printout would be too expensive. We have even been told that a printout would be unconstitutional. Perhaps, it would be too accountable for the Government.According to The Economist, the US is having ongoing problems with its touch-screen electronic voting system. Experts have highlighted the dangers of using a paper free system which does not provide a physical, individual vote. Allied with other problems, it has been predicted that voters, unfamiliar with computers, could make mistakes during the rush to vote in the final hours of polling. This unfamiliarity could also lead to panic and difficulties among the elderly who have a lifetime of paper voting behind them and who may not feel confident with the new technology.In order to make more than a superficial difference and to sell the concept to voters, other enticements beyond the supposed efficiency benefit should be put in place. The vote of our younger citizens should be courted and made more attractive. For example, if a young person is abroad during a pre-university gap year, on postgraduate studies or a working break, he or she should be able to cash in on the electronic system and vote from wherever he or she is. These young adults are our future with their confidence in and knowledge of information technology. All expatriates should have an automatic right to exercise their franchise rather than feeling beyond the Pale by virtue of living abroad.In an ideal system, which would eliminate all doubts concerning corruption and vote-rigging, all electronic votes cast should be entered into a central terminal where it would be less likely to dispute the manner in which they were cast. Although the provisions enabling the introduction of electronic voting were included in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, no timescale was laid down. There is a legal doubt hanging over its proposed introduction next June. This was outlined this morning by Deputies Allen and McCormack in the Dáil, yet the guillotining of the Bill was still imposed. The Taoiseach has admitted that a ministerial order will be required to enable the system to be used in June 2004. This order will have to be made under section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) 2001 which, in turn, will be open to constitutional challenge in the courts.With this hanging over any proposal tointroduce electronic voting in the June elections, it would be expected, in everyone's interests, to delay full introduction until all doubts of aconstitutional and legal nature have been laid to rest. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and LocalGovernment, Deputy Gallagher, even at this late stage, to abandon the proposals for electronic voting until it is foolproof. I hope to get an opportunity later in the evening to pose further questions.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, to the House.I support electronic voting and counting. As the Minister of State said, this system has been in operation in The Netherlands and in many cities in Germany over the past ten years where it has been shown to be successful in elections. However, when we talk about electronic voting and counting, we must also include the issue of the electoral register. It is important that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government encourages local authorities to ensure that every effort is made to have those eligible included on the register. There are always problems during elections when people say they have a vote but are not on the register. Galway County Council has often recommended that the operation of the population census should be changed to include placing people on the electoral register.The Acting Chairman will know, having been a member of the council, that there have been many proposals from local authorities and the Department to close the smaller polling stations. I would not like to think the excellent idea of electronic voting and counting will be used to further reduce the number of polling stations. Local authorities should examine their schemes and make it easy for people to get to the polling station. There were proposals in 1985 that there should be a minimum of 1,000 people voting at a polling station for it to remain open. If that were to happen in west Galway or in the Minister of State's constituency people would have to travel long distances to a polling station. That does not make voting more accessible. When we speak of these machines, we should not talk aboutreplacing people as a number one goal. It should be about making the polling station moreaccessible and these machines available. Let us also hope these machines will be for stations with 200 people voting, as well as the 1,000 people threshold that some local authorities have proposed.It will be exciting to run the local and European elections in June through the electronic voting system. Three million people will have the opportunity of voting on these machines which we saw in operation in the Mansion House last week. Electronic voting can bring many benefits such as making our elections more accurate and democratic. One of the deficiencies of the current system is that many votes are not counted because they are invalid. Senator Finucane has spoken on the Order of Business about his particular difficulties when the count comes down to one or two votes between candidates. He is in favour of electronic voting.In the last European elections, almost five years ago, more than 6,000 people who went to the polls had their votes ruled out. Some deliberately spoiled their votes but most did not. It is worth considering the change that could make to a few seats because those invalid votes can have a major bearing on the results of elections. In the last local elections in 1999, for example, 21,000 votes were deemed to be invalid while 40 council seats were decided by less than 50 votes. Anyone who believes in democracy should want to improve the system and it should be a key priority for any Government to ensure that every vote is counted accurately.Elections are crucial to the functioning of democracy. They provide for the ordinary transfer of power but they also help to cement the citizens' trust and confidence in Government. Change in the running of elections tends to come slowly and I can see why people who areaccustomed to the present system would perhaps be loath to change. It can be difficult for candidates if, as we saw in the last general election, the count continues for several days and the votes counted can change from a plus to a minus very quickly. That demonstrates the drawback of the present system, as the Minister of State pointed out.I am very glad the Minister of State spoke about the Dutch-UK company Nedap, appointed following an international tender to deliver an electronic solution to the voting and counting process. More than 400,000 people used the system in 2002 in the general election and the referendum on the Treaty of Nice and their response has been very positive. Successful operation is the most worthwhile possible test of reliability. The Minister of State made a good point about what people describe as interference. Why have they not talked about the security of the ballot box rather than raising many questions about the security of this new system which has been subjected to rigorous testing by a range of independent agencies? It has been independently certified in Germany and in the Netherlands and an Irish company undertook an independent code review of the software.The people have always, rightly, had confidence in those who administer our elections and will continue to administer them. This time they will be using a system that eliminates human error in the voting and counting. It is a system that will ensure that the results declared reflect the exact intent of the voters more closely than any system used before. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has considered the different comments on the new system — some informed, some not — but he has to choose whether to listen to wild conspiracy theories about people wanting to undermine our electoral system or go with an accurate and democratic system.

The Minister of State has told us there will be countrywide roadshows or a visit to the provinces. It is very clear that there are benefits from the new system. It is easier to use, very efficient, improves electoral accuracy and administration and, most important, it eliminates the democratic wastage associated with spoiled votes.The process is straightforward as we saw last Wednesday and I hope that the Minister's information campaign will extend to the whole country, employing a range of media, including television, radio, the Internet, poster advertising and every possible means of communication to ensure that the campaign is successful. A total of 400,000 people have already used the system and their comments have been very favourable. I hope we can make the electoral system successful and that people will be comfortable with it. The Department has said there will be a 120 day roadshow demonstration of the new machine after Easter, reaching every part of the country. I am in favour of this new system and the public has demonstrated a positive response to date. I hope it will be successful for those who use it in June and I wish all the candidates every success.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I speak as a confirmed and conscientious Luddite. I have never been attracted to this system for which there is not the slightest demand. Can the Minister of State give any indication that the Irish public demanded this? It seems to be an outbreak of technophilia. I thought I had invented that word until I read a very interesting paper by Mr. Andrew Ó Baoill so I am not alone in suspecting the outbreak of technophilia, the love of gizmos for their own sake. There was no demand for this system. I listened to some of the Minister of State's speech and his opening remarks on the lines that it is good enough for the Dutch and who are we to object. There are many things that are good enough for the Dutch and my colleague, Senator McCarthy, will specify a few for which the Irish people might not have such an appetite. It is a slightly lazy argument to say the Dutch and the Germans use this. So what? They do many other things we would not want to do and if we to invent a system here we need to have it checked; the check by Zerflow showed up several defects.One of my objections relates to the elimination of the human element. The pap about making things easy is the same nonsense that destroyed the Irish language. I learned this when we had our own lovely cló Gaelach script and there were words in Irish which originated in the Irish culture like "an bóthar" now replaced by "ród". Grammar was simplified to the point of making the language so dull, boring and uninspiring that nobody would waste ten minutes trying to learn it and that is why it is practically extinct now. The Government is going to do the same with voting by making it so easy that people will just have to sit down and push a button in between stuffing Mars bars into their mouths and watching the television.Getting out to vote is a very good and sociable activity. I object to spoiling all the fun. It was immense fun in the old days when I went down to Marlboro Street where there would be members of Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil. It was a real occasion. What will happen to the human interest that generated an excitement in politics on election night because the tallymen could be marvellously accurate? This system will be a dull, bland technological exercise in which the electorate will eventually lose interest completely. It is not even secure.The principal point is the need for a paper trail. Mr. Ó Baoill writes:Rather than concentrate on abandoning a manual system that was generally sufficient for the task at hand, the government should instead investigate means of enabling members of the public to participate more broadly and deeply in the political process.Hear, hear. Let the Minister not come back here and bellyache when no one votes because I will point to the record and say with some satisfaction, and in a spiteful way, that I told him so.The question of technophilia is illustrated in various answers, including that given by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, who is a decent person and a good Minister of State. She said that the aim of the Government is "to make maximum use of available technology while ensuring that citizens can still get direct access to public officials". The primary instance is technology, while the human voters come second. We must make maximum use of the technology to show the Germans and the Dutch that we are as slick and sophisticated as they are — I do not care — while the voters come second. That is the wrong order. The voters should come first and the intention of the Government and the technology should be to facilitate the voters.As regards auditability, which is the voting equivalent of accountability, a woman called Lynn Landes states:Voting takes three-steps: marking, casting and counting the ballot. Only the first step should be private (although for the severely disabled that may not always be possible), but the second two steps to voting must be open to public scrutiny. That is the only way we can ensure that elections are fair and honest.That is the position I would adopt.I mentioned Zerflow consultants because we talked about examining the system and having a test. These are the people the Government commissioned and they found a certain level of vulnerability. Their report described several flaws in the proposed system. These revolved around security shortcomings in the system, with the report claiming that the new system opened up the voting process to several new forms of attack and subversion. Opportunities for fraud included the possibility of pasting a dummy ballot paper over the real paper and a proven instance of the keys securing a voting machine being copied by an unauthorised person. The security has been breached. Where are we now? Perhaps the Germans did not mind, but Irish people would have an objection. As other scholars in this area have pointed out, if all the audit trails are internal to the machine, there cannot be any independent audit as it would be technically impossible. That means there would not be any auditability.The ignorant assumption of unsophisticated people confronted by what they perceive as a sophisticated continental European experience is that the machine is infallible. That is not true. It is obvious that machines can make mistakes. One has only to look at one's ESB bills, for example, to realise what computers can do.

He or she states:We turn to technology because it supposedly eliminates human error. I suggest that we add humans to the process in order to eliminate technological errors. And we'd save a lot of money in the process.That is the position I would adopt. Rather than eliminating the human element in favour of the machine, we should add the human element to the machine, where possible.Electronic voting will make life more boring, even in this Chamber.

We must remember the deep vein thrombosis problem. Getting sedentary politicians to stand up and march around is good. It is also an opportunity to lobby and discuss issues. It allows for human interaction. People are trying to escape from sitting like dummies and pushing buttons in factories. Why have we introduced it here?I speak as a confirmed conscientious Luddite. There are good reasons for us not to gallop into this and to preserve some of our heritage, such as the tallymen and election night. Otherwise, it will make politics so bland no one will be bothered with it.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome the opportunity todiscuss electronic voting. This issue was discussed at great length at the Joint Committee onEnvironment and Local Government. Many ofthe questions which have been asked werecomprehensively dealt with at that committee by the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials.The thrust of the change to electronic voting is to make the process more accessible and accurate and, therefore, more democratic. I disagree with Senator Norris about the human element. As an unemployed tallyman, I know the human element will still exist in the system as proposed to ensure its accuracy. I welcome the eradication of the spoiled vote. The Minister stated that the electoral law was not introduced to enable people to spoil their votes. I remember being told by my grandparent that people fought and died for the privilege to vote in this country. That has been lost in the mists of time, but we must try to bear it in mind.Those in the House who participated in the process of tallying and verifying votes at a count know that while the process may have been enjoyable, it was inefficient and archaic in many cases. Invalid votes have always been a problem. Some Members in both Houses have had the experience of losing a seat because of disputed votes. The new system will eradicate theseanomalies and ensure the accuracy of all the ballots.Someone said we should approach this matter cautiously. If approaching this matter for six years does not represent caution, I do not know what does. If we were to wait the length of time advocated by some commentators, we would not get anything done and we would still be talking about it in six years time. The process of changing the system has been painstakingly undertaken.This system has been in operation in a number of countries for the past 15 years. Germany and the Netherlands were mentioned.

It is already in operation in the UK. The Department has always insisted that the system should be tested, adapted to our needs and piloted on a major scale. The majority of the 400,000 people who voted electronically in the last election were satisfied with the system's security, accessibility and efficiency and with the final result.We have all heard about voter apathy, which seems to have taken root in our democracy. We had a discussion this morning on the Order of Business about the media's presentation of how Parliament works. It is no wonder people are cynical and apathetic when one considers the comments about how we operate here. This change is about more than technology; it is about empowering people, particularly young people.

The promotion of the new system will highlight the importance of people having their say and participating in the process. It is important that people know, when they are casting their votes, that their views are being taken into account. They are participating in the system of choosing their public representatives who will represent them and they have to be comfortable with the fact that their views and choice is as valid as the next person's. The information, demonstrations, road shows and training of the presiding officers, polling clerks and count staff will ensure that the system as proposed will be efficient, effective and will assist in the promotion of democracy in the country. The dissemination of information through all forms of the media will ensure that by the time of the next election, everybody will have had a chance to study and understand the new system.Many of us attended the demonstration in the Mansion House. While questions were asked, they received answers. The officials on hand had a very good grasp of the system. Senator Bannon had a bad experience. The Minister has given an undertaking that the system as it stands will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. I understand that no technological changes can occur in the source code, etc, until October 2004. The Minister has indicated that he will make a decision on it at that stage.I warmly welcome the introduction of electronic voting. It is a progressive step. Some people believe we should not lead the way and should wait until France, Germany, Spain and all other countries in Europe have such a system and then we can follow them if it suits. The way the system has been tested, retested and piloted has proven its effectiveness.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I express my appreciation to the Leader of the Seanad, Senator O'Rourke, for organising this debate, which we have sought for some time. I acknowledge her efforts in acceding to the Members' request in this regard. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. It is unfortunate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is not here as I prepared on the basis of speaking directly to him.It is interesting that the argument being used in some quarters to support electronic voting is that it is being done in the Netherlands, Germany or the UK. We all know the experience of the judicial system in the United Kingdom, which incarcerated those such as the Birmingham six and the Guildford four. We will not necessarily emulate that system. It is possible to smoke cannabis in the street in the Netherlands — it is not illegal. Does that mean we will all smoke cannabis after we vote electronically in June? It is a lazy argument to justify doing it here because it is being done in those countries.There has been some good scientific research in this area. I believe in the spirit of electronic voting for a multiplicity of reasons. However, I disagree with the manner in which it is being introduced. Much of the scientific research in this regard is being ignored. I know it worked well on a pilot basis at the last general election. There is a very good case to be made for electronic voting on the basis of the count in the Cork SouthCentral constituency where two candidates slogged it out for two weeks, which was inhumane. That is not a satisfactory way for candidates to fight for the last seat. This was one of the failings of the manual system. On the other hand, we had the infamous announcement of the result in the Dublin North constituency and the shock and horror that was visited on one of the candidates.Electronic voting was used extensively in the second referendum on the Nice treaty in a number of the commuter areas and in many Dublin constituencies. However, during thatcontest some areas experienced failures of the system, to which I will refer shortly. It is not wise to ignore the scientific research. There have been comprehensive reports by computer scientists in NUI Maynooth and by experts who have observed the American, British, German andpresumably Dutch systems. It would be anti-democratic for us to end up with a system such as that used in Florida where the person with most votes was not deemed elected. The most powerful figure on the globe is in his position because of the failure of an electronic voting system. The State has not learned from those notorious examples.The manner of introduction of the systemborders on arrogance. I do not suggest that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is trying to do anything other than improve the system. However, there is an arrogant manner which is clouding the judgment of the Minister in introducing electronic voting. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, mentioned a voter verifiable audit trail in his introduction. The absence of such an audit trail means that the openness and transparency, which characterised the traditional manual system, are now consigned to history. To build any trust in the system, this area needs to be considered.There is a growing level of international and local support calling for the VVAT to be part of all electronic systems. The basic principle of voter verifiable audit trail is to ensure that each voter can be 100% certain his or her vote has been recorded accurately and has been included in the count. This is not the case at present. The absence of these formal control processes and procedures around the usage of the current system exposes the electoral process to possible interference from unauthorised persons.Documentation released by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicates there are no formal processes for restricting access to count centre PCs during the count, installation of software on count centre PCs, verification of software installation on count PCs and of voting machines, or purchasing of ballot modules, which are the memory devices needed in the voting machines. It would be advisable to suspend electronic voting until a voter verifiable audit trail is available to give each voter absolute confidence in the system and a guarantee that their votes have been recorded and counted.Appropriate control processes and procedures should be implemented by the Department with audit and supervisory responsibility vested in an independent body. That body could be one such as the Standards in Public Office Commission. Integrated end-to-end testing including statistical analysis of the randomisation feature must be carried out to verify the accuracy of the entire system. The Department should commit to providing full details of tally information in a database form after each election.Will we be able to get access to tally figures after the system is used in June? The accuracy of the tallymen and tally women was an integral part of the manual system and, depending on thesuccess or otherwise of the candidate, added to the excitement of the count. It was an important facet of Irish elections when that system was used. There may have been constitutional issues with the operation of tally people as long as we have had elections. It was probably never challenged as it benefited all political parties and none.One of the myths about e-voting is that we trust computers for e-commerce and e-banking. I do not and I know very few people who do. When I withdraw money from an ATM, I count the cash and check the slip. I know very few people who blindly — metaphorically speaking — insert their cards and trust the machine to dispense the correct amount of money. Those who know about computers know they are capable of creating errors. Humans make errors and humans make computers. Therefore, computers can make errors. I do not trust that system.There is no evidence to support the assertion that e-voting will encourage voter participation. E-voting without adequate checks and balances will only undermine voter trust in the system. It is a myth to suggest that the Irish e-voting system is open to independent scrutiny. Even the Government will not have full details of the e-voting software until four months after the election.Another myth propounded is that the Irish e-voting system has been developed to the highest possible standard. The developers of the Irish e-voting system have not come close to bestpractice in developing critical systems. Thesystem utilises low grade software and runs on ordinary desktop computers. The statement that the system was tested successfully at the lastgeneral election is another myth. The tests showed that the machines did not fail in any obvious way but, on closer examination, one discovered that there were a number of flaws. There is no proof that the machines correctly recorded all the votes cast. This could only be done if an independent paper record of each vote was checked by the voter and placed in a ballot box. It should also be noted that the software has gone through many changes since the last time it was used.There is an issue surrounding the use of receipts. Some people say it would endanger the secrecy of the ballot but I do not accept that because scientific research proves otherwise. There is no proposal for voters to take home the paper receipt. Rather, the proposal is that the paper ballots be stored in sealed ballot boxes with all of the security and secrecy used in the current paper-only system. I fervently believe that the absence of that process will be detrimental to the success of the system.In one incident, a failure occurred in a ballot module in Dublin South West. It was used at St. Paul's senior and junior primary schools, Limekiln. It had a "blocked check sum — not in order" failure and was sent to Nedap-Powervote for a report. This shows that computer systems can fail and that part of the Irish system has done so already.In 1996, a US Senator had shares in the company which produced the machines that counted the votes in the Senate election in which he was the victor. Who owns the shares in the numerous companies involved in the Irish system, including Nedap-Powervote and the Irish and UK arms of that company? There could be a conflict of interest, of which we have seen enough in both Houses in recent years. I would be particularly interested to know what security is used to protect each vote in the access database.Why is there such a rush to implement this system when we are conscious that good advice is being ignored? Why has the Department not carried out a critical cost-benefit analysis? I do not think a proper risk assessment been carried out on the scheme. Has the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a value for money audit on the system? If so, what is the result and can we have the report?These are just some of the 41 questions submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government which have never been answered. The system was accepted by a vote on the committee but that vote was split down the middle, with the Government barely scraping a marginal victory. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State answered and addressed some of those questions.

I also acknowledge the address of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to the environment committee some weeks ago. I also welcome electronic voting. Many of the questions, such as those asked by Senator McCarthy, were asked at that committee and everything bar the kitchen sink has been thrown at the Minister since. However, from the replies given by the Minister and the Minister of State, I have confidence that this system is workable.When the election is over, the electorate will ask what all the fuss was about. It is nice to see Ireland moving in the right direction byimproving voting and counting systems. We all acknowledge the fine job done by returning officers and staff who have run elections over the years. Ministers for the Environment have been responsible for elections and we mustacknowledge that no questions have ever been asked about an election and nothing has finished up in court. It is wrong to state that the current Minister, who happens to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, could rig the votes or introduce a system which could transfer votes from one party to another. The machines are stand-alone and the modules from them are treatedindependently — it is not the same system as an ATM machine, which is open to the electronic airways.

#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Questions have been raised about the responsibilities of the returning officers in regard to spoilt votes. To my knowledge, once the electoral register is ticked off in a polling station, the number of votes can be compared to the recorded number of times the machine has been used. However, if there are spoilt votes when a button is not pressed, are they regarded as spoilt votes when the returning officer makes his or her return to a count centre? For example, if 1,000 ballots are issued and 900 are used, one can make up one's own mind about how many spoilt votes there are in a constituency or nationally.Questions have been asked about carrying out end-to-end election testing. Can arrangements be made to demonstrate the system by conducting a complete end-to-end election, including theprinting of the individual ballot papers, to enable a count to be carried out? If there is a localelection petition hearing request to the High Court or Circuit Court, the election machine will have to print out ballot papers for thatconstituency. There will be two numbers on this printout — one which indicates when the ballot was cast and another to indicate at what stage the ballot was transferred. If this were carried out after the next election, or even beforehand, it might allay fears in regard to the validity of the system. The system should meet the concerns of the people as regards confidentiality and the eligibility of people to vote, which is most important. There are four modules in each machine. If there is a malfunction, which one is the most important for the count?I thank the Minister and the Department for bringing this system forward. It is nice to see a modern Ireland which might not be the last country to declare after the European elections. Perhaps this time we will come in early.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	168	The reason this is the case is that this scheme has been run politically. There has been no all-party consensus. This goes back to the 2001 legislation, proposed by then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. We agreed it should go on a trial period or pilot programme for the 2002 elections. However, since then, it has been railroaded through and one cannot deal with an issue as serious and important as the voting system unless one has all-party support. Once there is controversy in this regard, the whole system is denigrated. I regret that the Government chose to handle this issue itself rather than leaving it to an independent commission to make recommendations. That is where the problem lies and, until that issue is resolved, we will continue to do our parliamentary duty in putting the questions which have to be asked on behalf of citizens.There is no demand for this system. The demand came from the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's predecessor, who decided this would be a good idea, without any consultation with the Opposition or the public at large. He decided the Government would splash out €40 million on it. For €40 million, one would put the best IT software and computers into every classroom in the country. We are talking about the technology age — we should get real. The vast majority of national schools have no computer system in place, yet we are splurging €40 million on a system just to prove we are "technologically advanced".The vast majority of countries in the EU have not gone down this route. The Minister of State referred to "these countries" but to whom is he referring? Is it the Dutch and some regions of Germany? The British have not used this system — it is a pilot scheme, with which they are not proceeding — and the House of Commons rejected it. Let us get real. If we have €40 million to spend, let it at least do something technologically important for children, such as putting decent computers into schools rather than splurging money on this issue.Time is being wasted on something that does not matter. If this goes wrong, it will only add to the level of cynicism about politics in general. Is the Minister accepting that primary legislation must be put in place before the June elections in order to implement this system? The 2001 Bill gave the Minister power to do this in a number of named constituencies for the purposes of a pilot test. Does the Minister concede that primary legislation is needed? When will we see that legislation?The paper trail is a key issue. I remember what Senator McCarthy said about the ATM machines. I recently looked for €100 and the ATM machine gave me €50. I got a receipt for €100, so I went straight into the bank and told them about the problem and asked them for the €50 that I had been swindled. The notion that ATM machines and other forms of electronic banking work perfectly without glitches is just not true. The Government needs to respond to the issue of the paper trail. It is important that when people vote, they get some receipt which they can place in a ballot box and the ballot papers can be added up to see if they are close to the actual result. That will give extra validity to the machines. Will the Minister comment in the course of his remarks on what now happens in the US as a result of the fiasco in Florida because since the last US presidential election, every new machine bought in the United States for the purpose of electronic voting must now issue a receipt? Every voter must now get a receipt and this was not the case in the past. If the United States of America have introduced that measure after the fiasco of Florida, surely we should follow their example and spend the extra money, if it necessary, on this device. People are afraid that their vote will not be counted. The way to deal with that is to issue a receipt which will then be placed in a ballot box and the number of receipts can be tallied against the number of votes cast. I accept that one would allow a 1% margin of error, but if it comes within that range, we will know we have counted all the votes. People are looking for such an assurance and I ask the Minister to reply to that point.Let us consider the doomsday scenario of the crash. Everyone knows that a computer crash happens from time to time in this House on a smaller system. As I understand it, and I stand corrected if I am wrong, a Microsoft Access programme tabulates all the votes. Assuming there is a crash, it stops. Microsoft Access, which is a very basic system will tabulate all the votes for all the candidates so we can get a printout if that happens. People in the IT industry accept that Microsoft Access is a dated, historically deviant programme — I use it in the office — which is out 15 years and I understand that a spokesperson for Microsoft said when replying to this issue, that if the application needs transaction support, even in the event of a network server, client computer or client application crash one will want to use an MSDE or SQL server, which I understand are the most secure modern top of the range forms available. Why are we going for a dated system, which to use the words of a question asked recently "would not be used for the storing of critical information"? Casting a vote is not comparable with an e-banking transaction, it is vital and absolutely essential that the people have confidence in the electoral system. They have had confidence in the paper trail system, since the foundation of the State. The system is open and transparent and people can see what is going on. I am very concerned about this, even more concerned now than I was six months ago. It is probably my own fault for not having been brought up to speed on the issues.Electronic voting is not an issue that can be rammed though because that will only fuel the cynicism about politics. Until the Opposition is ready to move on the issue, the Government should not move. The issue was badly handled. From day one it was driven by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under a politician. This question should have dealt with by an independent commission on which all the parties could be represented. Unless there is cross-party support for this, it will not happen. It needs to be changed.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I welcome the Minister and thank him for the information given to us to date and the work he has done, which is very much appreciated. I welcome the introduction of electronic voting, which has been in place in certain constituencies. It is very important to look back at the old system and acknowledge the problems that existed. I can recall at the last local elections where a Fine Gael and a Fianna Fáil councillor sweated overnight as a full box of ballot papers, containing 360 votes, were discovered unstamped and deemed invalid as a result of human error. Those two councillors, who I thought were dead certs, only hung on by the skin of their teeth and either one could have lost his seat by one vote.This is a better system and I compliment the people who have pushed it forward. Candidates had to ensure they had personal agents inside the polling station, principally to watch that the ballot papers were stamped before the voters took them. The onus is on the voter to ensure his voting paper is stamped, but that does not always happen. I have been involved in a great many counts and have seen votes spoiled simply because the ballot paper was not stamped. I saw that happening down through the years in all elections.With electronic voting, all preferences will be examined. In the past, a bundle of ballot papers would be taken, which could have positive or negative implications for a candidate. I heard a man on radio say that he was not happy because he could not spoil his vote. The best thing a person could do in that case is to stay away altogether and join the 40% who do not vote. I recall that in 1998 a system similar to this was shown by some of the Department's officials who are here today to members of the General Council of County Councils at an annual conference. At that time, it was considered to be a move in the right direction, that we were moving forward with technology. I listened to people on the Opposition benches say they disagreed with this but I speak every other day to their party supporters who say this has to be a new and better system. I cannot fully understand the Opposition's position. Members on all sides have questions but they are prepared to take on board a new system.The Minister has said that the results of each count will be announced and candidates will not have to wait, as happened in north County Dublin, to hear the result as the announcement is made. Candidates will get an indication as each count progresses and that is to be welcomed.We must go out there and sell the system and we must ensure that the people who will vote in June will have an opportunity to look at the system and see how it works. It not good enough to go only to the bigger centres; people in rural areas must be afforded the opportunity to see the system at the post office or local library.We must also bring this system into our schools, particularly secondary schools, so that young people will be interested in the political process and will be only too glad to employ the new voting technology. We hope that a larger percentage of young people will vote as a result. Electronic voting affords an ideal opportunity for disabled people to vote. In the past, elderly bed-ridden people could not exercise their right to vote in elections, but electronic polling booths could be brought into institutions for the elderly to enable them to vote. We already have postal voting but electronic voting will provide increased opportunities, especially for the elderly.Electronic voting was introduced for divisions in both Houses of the Oireachtas. In the past we thought it could never happen but time moves on and it has happened. There are no problems with voting results in the Houses of the Oireachtas and it will be the same with the new voting system for European and local elections.

This country has pioneered such technology, which I welcome. I look forward to making further progress in this respect in future. I compliment the Minister and his officials for the way in which they have set out and explained the relevant information. I have read the report of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, at which the proposal for electronic voting was explained in great detail.Perhaps the Minister of State can explain when and where postal votes will be put into the electronic system? Will they have to be brought to the particular area in which they were cast in order to be inserted in the local module, or will that be done at the count centre? I appreciate that the Minister of State will deal with our questions in his reply.

Public ownership of the process is important. It is a fundamental tenet of our democracy that we must have trust and confidence in the system, otherwise we would have a crisis on our hands. If we have to delay the introduction of electronic voting for a while until agreement is reached between all parties, it will be in the best interests of democracy. There are too many doubts and we must eliminate all of them. Electronic polling machines must be capable of being checked and the system generally must be verifiable. There must be some kind of audit or paper trail, otherwise the European and local polls will be guinea-pig elections, run on a trial and error basis. Citizens suffering from disabilities, including short-sightedness, are wondering how they will cope with the new machines. I would also like to hear the Minister of State's reply to Senator Moylan's point concerning postal ballots.People have the right to vote and the right, if they wish, to spoil a vote. As democrats, we do not encourage them to spoil their votes; we want to see them cast their votes positively for whatever party or candidate they choose. In his opening remarks, the Minister of State stated:A person may attend at a polling station, be marked off the register of electors, approach the voting machine and leave without pressing the ‘cast vote' button. In this case the machine will be deactivated and it will record the occurrence for inclusion in the election statistics.However, the presiding officer, polling clerk and agents of party candidates will know that such a person has not pressed the ‘cast vote' button. They will know therefore that the person has deliberately chosen to spoil his or her vote and in such circumstances the secrecy of the ballot will be destroyed.Are the Minister of State and his officials satisfied that all constitutional requirements will be met under the proposed electronic voting system? As a layman, I do not think they will. I refer to Article 16.1.4° of the Constitution, which states that "... the voting shall be by secret ballot." Specifically, I would draw the attention of the House to the High Court Irish Law Reports, IR 69 of 1972. I am sure the Minister of State's officials are well aware of the High Court case to which I refer, which is McMahon v the Attorney General. In his ruling in that case, Mr. Justice Pringle declared that the words “secret ballot” in Article 16 “mean a ballot in which there is complete and inviolable secrecy”. I contend that secrecy is not provided for in the specific instance referred to by the Minister of State, which I have already quoted. I would like to hear the Minister of State's response to that point. I have many other questions but that one is very important.I would also like to hear the Minister of State's response to as many as possible of the 41 questions that arose from the consultants attendance at the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There was a serious breakdown in a Belgian case, which is referred to among those questions.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Governments and Departments list their priorities at election time. It amazes me, however, that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government put electronic voting as one of its priorities, when 50,000 people are on the housing waiting lists over which the Minister of State presides. In addition, many hundreds of people are homeless. The €40 million that is being spent on the introduction of electronic voting could do so much to help such unfortunate people. Who demanded that we should change our voting system? Was there a public outcry in favour of it? Is it being done here only because they have it in Germany and the Netherlands? People want a transparent system they can trust. The way in which the Minister of State, and the Government generally, have gone about this business, has instilled a lack of trust and confidence in the polling system, which is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. If one can get a proper receipt from an ATM machine, one should be able to get a proper record when people vote. People want some sort of transparency in this regard.People make mistakes but there is no doubt that computers can also go wrong. The Minister of State should address the constitutional position, which was raised by previous speakers. How much will it cost annually to store and service this electronic voting system in each constituency on an ongoing basis? The public relations company that has been engaged to explain the electronic voting system was appointed by the Minister. It should refrain from adopting the biased approach we have witnessed to date. The Minister of State said that explanatory leaflets have had to be withdrawn because of the bias towards Fianna Fáil. As has been stated, the sample ballot papers for the European elections contained no reference to the main Opposition party, Fine Gael. Was this done by accident or design? In my own constituency, Fianna Fáil councillors were invited to attend the information road show that is going around the country, while other councillors were invited only after protesting that they had not received invitations.

We should have all-party support for electronic voting but the Government has gone about it in the wrong manner. We want answers to the questions that have been posed to ensure public confidence in electronic voting. We do not want to be negative on this issue. We support the introduction of new technology, but we must have trust and confidence in the system. I ask the Minister to deal with those issues.

It seems that the objective is to make the public cynical and that it is part of a broader aim to encourage distrust of the Government, something that is not merited by the system. This system is supervised and run by the public service under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am absolutely certain of the integrity of those officials and that it will not be open to political manipulation of any kind.

Would any one of us have had a chance to manipulate the officials who conducted our count to get the result that we wanted? That sort of accusation is unworthy, and it would be absolutely devastating, damning and catastrophic for the fortunes of any party which indulged in such actions or attempted to manipulate the vote, which I do not think is possible. That sort of argument should be dismissed. We do not walk away with a receipt from the ballot box at the moment, so why should we do so when we vote electronically?

The Minister answered the point and said that, in an election petition, the system can print a ballot paper with each vote cast and mix them, thus enabling a manual count to be conducted. That seems to deal with the matter. I agree with the point made by one of the Senators about not reducing the number of polling stations. There should be an adequate amount of time between each count and the chance of a ten-minute interval. I concede that many things were charming in the past. I enjoyed, 50 years ago, going with a donkey and cart to the creamery, but that does not necessarily mean that that is the way things should be done today.Senator Norris made technophilia sound almost like necrophilia. If there were a computer crash, I imagine that there would be back-up systems, as there are for most important matters. In the final analysis, I suppose one could order another election in a particular constituency. Electronic counting will be far more accurate. One should not believe that the present system is entirely free from error or abuse. Some examples have been given during this debate of where it was not so. This will be much fairer regarding transfers and so on. I would like the Opposition to stop the partisan politicking, which is unworthy of it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I am not totally decided, but I think I regret the introduction of electronic voting. The arguments on both sides are reasonably powerful. What Senator Mansergh said is true. Ultimately, making this issue into a political football is rather silly. Even if it has been abused in its initiation, it will not be abused over the years once established. While it is quite good fun to point out that it was introduced wrongly and that the advertisement was obviously partisan and should not have been exploited that way, in five years electronic voting will not work in favour of one party. I take on board Senator Mansergh's argument that it will be overseen by public servants and therefore be as impartial as anything else they oversee. We do not have any long-term complaints on that score.However, I believe that the old system had something special. It has nothing to do with technophobia or electronic voting. As the count went on for so long and was so exciting — an adventure in itself — more people participated. I cannot prove that, but neither can anyone prove the contrary. It was a great adventure for the Irish people. We had something special — a PR system that went on and on. It was like watching a long film or series of films, and people came back to it. There is a real danger that, when we introduce electronic voting, we will have lower rather than higher polls. I may be proved wrong, but there is a serious danger, at a time when participation in politics and voting patterns are falling, that this will further undermine the democratic process, because fewer people will participate. The timing is wrong, and it is unfortunate and unnecessary.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I thank the Senators for their contributions. It is tremendous to see such interest in the House. It is unfortunate that the same interest is not evident among the entire electorate at election time, as the valid poll would be much higher than normal. I genuinely believe that the new system will make it easier for the new voter, especially the elderly. Senator Norris referred to several views against the use of technology, but there are as many, if not more, in favour. It is a great feature of our democracy that everyone can express his or her views.I may not deal with all the questions, but a very personal one was asked concerning the Minister's right to extend electronic voting to all other constituencies in addition to Dublin West, Dublin North and Meath. Section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 is very clear. The Minister has that right, and there is no comparison between the case at Carrickmines discussed in this House and the primary legislation. Secondary legislation is sufficient, and the Minister has that right under section 48 of the Act. If it is challenged, that will be a matter for the courts, but we in the Department and our legal advisers are very confident regarding section 48. Of course, no one is infallible. Senator Norris is not here. Perhaps the only man who is infallible, as Senator Norris will agree, is the Pope.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	195	Senator Bannon, who spoke initially, referred to his experience at the launch last week. I know the Senator did not intend his remarks to be unfair, but they might have been so if the official was only being helpful. Needless to say, at the real poll on 11 June the polling staff will not approach the voting machine. That will be set out in the regulations or the rules for returning officers, which will be in the form of a booklet. Senator Kitt and other Senators referred to the closure of polling stations. There will be no change in the existing arrangements for selecting polling stations, which is of course a matter for the returning officer. The closure of stations is a matter for consultation with members of the local authority. I will make it very clear that the introduction of electronic voting should not be used as an excuse to close some of the smaller stations in rural Ireland.I would like to refer to the Zerflow security assessment report. Much misunderstanding was created by its presentation on television. I believe this arose from a lack of appreciation of the report's context and contents. The report was commissioned by the Department in February 2002, four months before the use of voting machines, as a risk assessment of the use of voting machines in polling stations. The report did not cover the integrity of the EMS, which was covered in other reports, but the possible physical threats in a polling station. These recommendations were considered by the Department before the use of voting machines in the general election in May 2002 and those considered directly relevant to general elections and referendums were incorporated into the instructions issued to the returning officers. The conditions covered by the major recommendation could only occur in circumstances of a widespread conspiracy between the returning officer's staff, polling station staff and external parties. It would have nothing to do with the machines.Reference was made to the accuracy of the register of electors. I am most anxious to ensure the register of electors is prepared to the highest standards of accuracy which we, as public representatives, all have a responsibility to ensure. I recognise there can be human error and that omissions can occur. Changes in the Electoral Act 1997 and in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 will reduce the extent of errors and omissions. The provision for the preparation and publication of a supplement to the register under the Electoral Act 1992 was extremely important. In the past, if one was not on the register of electors by February, that was it. However, the Electoral Act 1992 provides for a supplement to the register and gives people the opportunity to be added to the list up to a week before the date of the election.I welcome Senator McCarthy's acknowledgement that electronic voting is a good thing. That is accepted throughout both Houses. All of us support electronic voting, although some may be concerned about the detail or otherwise. Electronic voting is desirable. Some people say we should have long counts but Senator McCarthy's view is that we should do away with them. We have examined the research to which the Senator referred and we are satisfied with the testing regime, the pilot experience, the track record of the system in other countries and the ease with which the electorate has used the system to date. We should remember that we are not starting from a greenfield position. We have had experience of electronic voting in Meath, Dublin West and Dublin North in the general election and in the referendum. We have had no complaints from politicians or otherwise about it. Do we have to look over our shoulder? Naturally, we will look to other countries such as Holland and Germany and at some of the pilots in the UK where Nedap was used and was successful but let us look at our own experience which has been successful. Nedap manufactured the machines, PTB checked the software and TNO of Holland checked the physical pieces and components. The electoral reform society, not to be confused with the Electoral Reform Commission, has cleared the software. All the software and hardware has been accredited by the EC.There is no electoral commission in this country and it could take some time to establish one. The Public Offices Commission should not be confused with the electoral commission as in the UK. I know tallies are exciting for all of us, and Senator Coghlan referred to secrecy. I will outline my experience on an island off Donegal on which I, and Joe Brennan and Cormac Breslin before me, got three votes out of three. I do not think too many people complained about secrecy. I am not being flippant or facetious and I will deal with the Senator's question on secrecy.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Will the details of the tallies be made available?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I will deal with that. We all like to know from where votes come, but I will blend that with Senator Coghlan's question on secrecy. We are anxious to ensure tallies are available and we are in consultation with the Attorney General's office on what information can safely be provided without endangering the secrecy of the ballot. As the Senator said, the tallyman is not part of the statutory conduct of elections, so it is necessary to ensure protection of the secrecy of the ballot. We are anxious to ensure tallies are available, although not 100% as that would raise questions of secrecy and of the thresholds, which we are examining. There is no difficulty if there are thousands but with lower numbers such as hundreds, there may be a difficulty. Senators can be sure we will try to ensure, in consultation with the Attorney General, that we can continue some type of tallying.Senator Norris referred to the fun of elections. Elections are not about fun; they are a serious business. Perhaps he was being flippant when he referred to them in that way. Elections are a serious business and we want to ensure they are taken seriously. The Senator also referred to those at home being able to vote. I wish to make it abundantly clear that there will be no voting from home. Voting must take place in the polling station. If voting was to take place from home, it would be on the Internet and by text which, of course, can be hacked. As one of the Senators said, this system is not connected to any system either internally in the station or externally. No hacking can take place. We are a long way from voting on the Internet or by telephone. I think Senator Bannon said people who are abroad should be allowed to vote but that will not happen. People can apply for a postal vote if the nature of their business or illness so requires.Senator Moylan asked about postal votes. All postal votes will go, as is usual, to the returning officer, the ballot paper in the envelope will be checked as will the identification on it and they will be put aside. There will be an opportunity for the returning officer, his or her officials and representatives of the candidates to witness that. Around the close of voting, those votes will be fed into a machine and they will have their own module as postal votes. The idea of doing that at the last minute is that if it was done earlier in the day — it could physically be done — there would be a question of how the vote was going. Sometimes postal votes can be indicative of the overall voting trend, so they will be counted as normal.Senator Brian Hayes referred to the primary legislation. I made it clear — we have legal advice on it — that section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 provides for the use of the system at elections other than Dáil elections. In this case they will be used for European Parliament and local elections, which can be done by way of ministerial order.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Thank you. The Minister of State said the 2001 legislation does not refer to the polls in June but given the recent court cases which show the lack of sufficiency of ministerial orders, does he not agree there is a need for primary legislation if he is to advance this for June? If such legislation is not brought forward, will he bring forward separate orders? When will they be put to the House?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	201	This matter has been raised because of the Carrickmines case. I looked at the Supreme Court judgment on Carrickmines and without going into the details — I do not have the time nor is it necessary — this case bears no relationship to the making of an order under section 48 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001. Section 48 states clearly and, indeed, unambiguously provides that the Minister may make such adaptations of or modifications to the relevant statutory electoral code to enable the election to be conducted using electronic voting and counting.As one of the Opposition Members indicated in committee, this view may be challenged in the courts. From the legal advice we have obtained, however, we are confident the section 48 more than adequately covers the extension of electronic voting to elections in June this year.

The Bill provides a new legislative framework for civil registration, supports and enables the modernisation of the Civil Registration Service and facilitates the decentralisation of the General Register Office to Roscommon. The main objectives of the Bill are to rationalise the procedures for registering births, stillbirths and deaths; give an tArd-Chláraitheoir responsibility for overall policy for the Civil Registration Service, including maintaining standards of service; assign responsibility for the management, control and administration of the Civil Registration Service at local level to health boards; streamline the existing procedures governing the registration of adoptions; establish new registers of divorce and civil nullity; reform the procedures governing the registration and solemnisation of marriage and venues for marriage; and facilitate the future linking of life events.Civil registration was introduced in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and expanded in 1864 for the registration of births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages. Thus, a comprehensive registration system has been in place since 1864. This data forms a basic, continuous source of information about the population by providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence which has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liabilities, status and nationality.Civil registration touches on each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our birth and ending when our death is registered. In between these events, civil registration affects us directly, as in the case of marriage, or indirectly when certificates are required for many of the services available in our society, such as enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment and claiming a social welfare payment, to mention but a few.While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in our society as well as major developments in technology and increased expectations by citizens as to how public services should be delivered. In 2003, more than 110,000 life events were registered, approximately 500,000 certificates produced and some 1.2 million searches of registration records carried out.Recognising the importance of civil registration and acknowledging the changing needs of customers, the Government approved a programme of work to modernise the Civil Registration Service. The civil registration modernisation programme is a joint initiative between my Department, which is progressing civil registration legislation, and the Department of Health and Children, which oversees the administration of the Civil Registration Service. This is a major undertaking involving the introduction of modern technology providing on-line registration, electronic certificate production and the capture of digitised signatures; the redesign of business processes and procedures; capturing and storing in electronic format all paper-based records from 1845 onwards; and the reform of legislation which has given rise to the Bill.A key step in the process was the publication of a consultation document entitled, Bringing Civil Registration into the 21st Century, which sets out the context and proposed future approach to civil registration and related services. The purpose of the document was to engage with as wide a range of organisations and individuals as possible with regard to the proposals to modernise the service. Approximately 170 responses to the consultation document were received and these, together with views obtained during consultations with a number of organisations, have been considered in the development of the modernisation programme.Substantial tangible and intangible benefits will arise from the modernisation programme. These include improved service to customers, for example, extended opening times; greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduction in red tape; nationwide standards for registering life events; the registration of divorces and civil annulments on a central register; the electronic capture and transmission of all vital statistics on life events to the Central Statistics Office; the sharing of data with designated Departments and agencies; the facilitation of long-standing plans to decentralise the General Register Office toRoscommon; and reducing the demand for paper certificates for the purposes of Government services.As part of the groundwork for the programme of modernisation, Senators will recall that amendments to a number of the provisions of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Acts were included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, to facilitate the implementation of a new computerised system to cater for the electronic registration of births and deaths and electronic certificate production for births, deaths and marriages. I am pleased to inform the House that the roll-out of the new civil registration system is well under way and is currently operating in five health board areas. It is expected that the implementation of the system in the remaining health board areas will be completed by mid-2004.Until now, the registration and certificate production processes were manual, time consuming and location dependent. The modernisation programme marks a fundamental change in the way the Civil Registration Service operates and is delivering significant improvements in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction throughout the country.The Government is committed to improving public services by modernising the way it does its business. New Connections, the Government's information society action plan, identifies e-government as a key infrastructural mechanism and the e-inclusion programme as a key supporting framework. In line with the Government's commitment to improving the way services are organised, integrated and delivered to customers, my Department initiated a number of significant programmes, including the civil registration modernisation project; the development of the REACH inter-agency messaging service; the automated establishment of public service identity in respect of children born in Ireland; and the service delivery modernisation project.The capacity to share data is a key building block underpinning the integration of public service delivery. To facilitate the sharing and e-enabling of life event data between Government agencies, REACH developed an inter-agency messaging service, IAMS, which is currently being used to transfer registration data between the Civil Registration System, this Department and the Central Statistics Office. This facility will be used to make death registration data available electronically to other Government agencies with effect from the end of February.The service delivery modernisation programme aims to deliver a high quality, proactive service to customers. The redesign of the child benefit system is the first manifestation of the new service delivery framework. Since September 2003, all new birth registration data is transferred electronically to my Department from the civil registration computer system. This facilitates the allocation of a personal public service number to a child at registration which establishes a child's public service identity; the creation of family links on the national central database for all citizens, the client records system which is administered by my Department; and initiation of a child benefit claim for first born children and automatic payment for second and subsequent children in a family. For example, payment of child benefit in respect of a baby born and registered by the civil registration system on Monday is made by Thursday or alternatively the mother is contacted by my Department, without any manual intervention. This is a prime example of the e-government objective of Departments working together to provide more convenient access to services for citizens.The introduction of the new civil registration system, therefore, is a flagship initiative in providing life-centred services to customers. The visible improvement from the customer's perspective is that a single interaction with a public service agency, for example, the registration of a birth, not only achieves its original purpose but also triggers a series of related services by another agency, in this case, my Department. Customers availing of the e-enabled service no longer have to source and complete a multi-paged paper application form and supply a paper birth certificate. They simply have to register the baby's birth to set the process in motion.I will outline the provisions contained in the Bill and, as Members will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions. The administration of the civil registration service is provided for in Part 2 of the Bill. Sections 7, 9 and 12 provide for the continuation of the existing offices of an tArd-Chláraitheoir, the assistant to an tArd-Chláraitheoir — to be named an tArd-Chláraitheoir Cunta — and Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora. Section 13 provides powers for an tArd-Chláraitheoir to establish and maintain registers of births, stillbirths, adoptions, deaths, marriages, divorce and civil nullity, the last two mentioned being new registers. In the future all life events will be stored in electronic registers.Sections 14 and 15 provide for the establishment of local registration authorities which will be the health boards who will appoint a superintendent registrar to administer the service at local level. Each registration authority will be required to set out a formal scheme for the administration of the civil registration service in their area. This Part also contains a number of provisions which facilitate the delegation of certain functions, for example, late registration, from an tArd-Chláraitheoir to local registration authorities.Part 3 of the Bill provides for the registration of births and stillbirths. The principal responsibility for registering a birth will remain with the parents, who will be required to register the event within three months of the birth. To facilitate parents in fulfilling this obligation, the current time limit of 42 days will be extended to three months. In future, births may be registered with any registrar as opposed to the current system where a birth can only be registered by the registrar of the district in which the birth occurred.Sections 23 and 24 of the Bill allow a birth to be re-registered to include the father's details where they were not entered in the register at the time of registration. Sections 26 and 27 provide for the registration of certain births and stillbirths occurring outside the State. This includes the birth or stillbirth to an Irish citizen in jurisdictions where no registration system exists or the registration records are unavailable; on Irish-registered ships and aircraft; to an Irish citizen on foreign ships and aircraft; and to members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána while serving abroad. The provision relating to births and stillbirths on aircraft is being introduced for the first time. In addition, this provision addresses the current anomaly where the birth or stillbirth of a child on board an Irish-registered ship, in certain circumstances, cannot be registered.Sections 28 and 29 provide for the registration of stillbirths. In future parents or a relative may register the stillbirth within 12 months. Currently only the parents can register the stillbirth within 42 days. The new provisions are being introduced to allow the family of the child more time to undertake the necessary registration procedures while coping with their loss.Section 30 will require institutions, including hospitals, to notify the local registration authority of the occurrence of each birth and stillbirth. This obligation also falls on doctors and midwives where such events occur outside these locations. This notification will be recorded electronically and will assist parents in their registration obligations at the registrar's office of their choice.Part 4 of the Bill provides for the registration of adoptions. In future, there will be one adoption register for the registration of all adoptions in the State. Adoptions are currently registered in either the adopted children's register for adoptions effected within the State, or the foreign adoption register for foreign adoptions. An authorised officer of the Adoption Board will act as registrar for the purposes of these registrations.Section 35 provides that access to the register of adoptions or the index which makes traceable the connection between this register and the register of births will not be available except by order of the Adoption Board, or of a court which is satisfied that such access is in the best interests of the adopted person concerned. This continues an existing provision.Senators will be aware that at the instigation of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, a wide-ranging consultation process on adoption legislation, including information and post-adoption contact, was carried out in the second half of 2003. The findings from that process are being examined and proposals to amend the legislation to make it more compatible with Irish society today are being developed and will be circulated for observations before legislative proposals are brought to Government. Pending the outcome of that process, access to the existing manual indexes will be maintained for the present.Part 5 of the Bill concerns the registration of deaths. Section 37 provides that the primary responsibility for registering a death remains with the next-of-kin or persons who would have knowledge of the particulars of the death. This section also extends the list of persons who may provide details of a death to include specified staff of a hospital or institution where the death occurred and undertakers. The period for registering a death is also being extended from five days to three months from the date of death. In future, a death may be registered at any registrar's office. These measures allow greater flexibility for the person responsible for registering a death.Sections 38 and 39 provide for the registration of deaths which occur on ships and aircraft or deaths of members of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána while serving abroad. These measures are similar to the provisions of sections 26 and 27 which provide for the registration of certain births and stillbirths occurring outside the State.Part 6 of the Bill provides for reform of the law in respect of marriage. The provisions arise from recommendations of the inter-departmental committee on the reform of marriage law. Among the issues identified by the committee as requiring examination was the need for a universally applicable framework of clear and simple procedures to underpin the solemnity of the marriage contract. There are different requirements to be met, depending on the form of marriage whether it is civil or religious. These requirements can be complex and there is a strong need for clarity and simplicity in this area. The current rule that requires a couple to notify the registrar of marriages of the district at least three months before the intended date of marriage will continue in force. This was introduced in the Family Law Act 1995 in order to give couples intending to marry an opportunity to reflect on the seriousness and importance of the commitment they are making.Accordingly, section 46 of the Bill provides that three months notification of marriage must be made in person to a registrar and in a prescribed form. The current arrangement whereby a couple may apply to a court for an exemption to the three months notification rule, because of extenuating circumstances, will remain.In specified circumstances, a couple will be allowed to submit the three month notification in writing, for example, where the couple are living outside the State. However, in all such cases, the couple will be required to attend at the registrar's office at least five days prior to the intended date of marriage to sign an undertaking that there is no lawful impediment to the marriage and to produce other necessary documentation.This section also facilitates an tArd-Chláraitheoir to publish all marriage notifications received. This measure allows such information to be made available to the public and supports the public and open nature of marriage. Section 48 of the Bill introduces a new marriage registration form. This form will only be produced and given to a couple when they have completed all civil preliminaries for marriage. This is a very important document as no marriage can be solemnised without it. It is to be signed immediately after the ceremony by all the parties to the marriage. Responsibility for returning the completed form to a registrar lies with the couple who must do so within one month of the date of the marriage. Section 49 provides for the registration of marriages which is to be effected by either of the married couple by giving the completed marriage registration form to the registrar within one month of the marriage taking place.Section 50 provides that if a marriage registration form is not returned within 56 days of the date of marriage, the registrar can pursue the matter by issuing a reminder to the couple requiring the return of the form within a further 14 days. This follow-up measure is intended to ensure that the marriage is registered as soon as possible after its solemnisation.Section 51 of the Bill outlines the substantive requirements for the solemnisation of a valid marriage. It also provides for an interpretation service at the marriage ceremony, where necessary. Section 52 is concerned with the venues and times that a marriage can take place. It allows a marriage to be solemnised at a place and time agreed by the couple and the solemniser. The section also provides for the payment of fees by the couple where a civil marriage is conducted by a registrar at a location other than the registrar's office.Section 53 provides for an tArd-Chláraitheoir to establish and maintain a new register of solemnisers, which will replace the current register of churches and buildings. Only registered solemnisers and members of religious bodies temporarily authorised to do so may solemnise a marriage. Section 54 outlines the procedures to be followed by a religious body or local registration authority when applying to have one of its members entered in the register of solemnisers. Section 55 enables an tArd-Chláraitheoir to cancel an entry in the register of solemnisers and provides for the procedures involved in doing so.Section 56 introduces an appeals system which gives a person the right to appeal an tArd-Chláraitheoir's decision to refuse to register him or her in the register of solemnisers or to cancel his or her entry in that register. Section 57 allows an tArd-Chláraitheoir to grant a temporary authorisation to a member of a religious body to solemnise a specific marriage or to solemnise marriages within a specified time only. This measure is being provided to facilitate, for example, a clergy person who wishes to visit the State specifically to solemnise the marriage of a relative. Section 58 provides for the lodging of an objection to an intended marriage to a registrar and for the processing of such an objection.Part 7 of the Bill provides for the registration of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity by the Courts Service in new registers in accordance with section 13. Part 8 of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions relating to civil registration. Section 60 provides for the introduction of a formal appeals system for the first time. This will allow persons to appeal a decision of a registrar or an authorised officer to an appeals officer of the local registration authority.Section 61 provides for the conditions necessary for searches of registration records. Civil registration records are a matter of public record. Anyone can carry out a search and obtain a certificate of any event, excluding stillbirths, by paying a specified fee. The introduction of electronic registers and the electronic capture of all paper-based records will provide easier and faster access to registration records and will improve customer service. The provisions of this section will allow any person to search the indexes to all the registers and to purchase copies of the records relating to the searches, with the exception of the index of stillbirths and an index which makes traceable the connection between an entry in the register of adoptions and the corresponding entry in the register of births.Section 66 allows an tArd-Chláraitheoir to share certain registration information for specified purposes with designated Departments and agencies. This provision will facilitate the sharing of information, reduce form filling and the need for certificates for the administration and control of schemes and services. Section 67 makes provision for the Minister for Health and Children to make regulations for the charging of fees. For example, fees may be charged for issuing certificates or for undertaking the re-registration of an event, such as a marriages.The particulars required to be entered in the register of births, stillbirths, adoptions, deaths, decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill. A number of items in addition to those currently recorded are being included in each register. The enactments being repealed are listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill. It was necessary, in order to produce an updated Bill on civil registration, to examine existing legislation and to identify provisions which are obsolete or need to be restated or retained. Of the 28 Acts, dating back to 1844, which are being repealed in whole or in part, 12 were passed in the 19th century. This work is a clear example of the Government's commitment to regulatory reform.This Bill is the first major reform of civil registration legislation since it was introduced here in 1845. It is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to regulatory reform. All stakeholders — citizens, service providers and the Government — will share the benefits. The modernisation of the civil registration service is essential in its own right as it seeks to meet the needs of a modern society, but also as part of the Government's overall strategy of improving public services. It heralds a new era for civil registration through the introduction of electronic registration and electronic registers. Our goal is that the delivery of all State services will meet the challenges of the new century effectively. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the forthcoming debate.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to the House and I thank her for introducing this Bill, which my party broadly supports. Fine Gael welcomes any attempt to modernise the recording of births, marriages, deaths and other events which are of paramount importance in most people's lives. It is important that the Bill recognises events such as annulments and divorces, which were not pertinent in the 1840s when the initial legislation was passed.In recent years, we have seen a great deal of enlightened legislation, such as the Stillbirths Registration Act 1994 and the Registration of Births Act 1996. These Acts modernised parts of the law in this area. The 1994 Act established, for the first time, a statutory system for the registration of stillbirths. I welcome the extension in this Bill of the period in which stillbirths can be registered and the fact that parents can now ask a friend or another significant person to register a still birth, rather than having to endure the trauma of registering the child's name. The level of bereavement experienced by the parents and siblings of a stillborn child cannot be overstated. While society can show some sympathy, people often do not receive assistance from their friends and neighbours after the death of a child. In this context, therefore, it is very helpful to give more time for registration and to permit another relevant person to register the birth. I question the need for a mother's marital status to be included on a stillbirth registration certificate. I wonder if this provision is necessary.I have received a copy of the correspondence sent to the Minister by the co-ordinator of AMEN, who asks questions about the registration of unmarried fathers as guardians of their children. It seems that guardianship is a sufficient life event to warrant registration in a formal way. Does the Minister intend to address this aspect of the issue of guardianship in the Bill? Does she intend to address the matter in other legislation?It is essential that all the administrative systems of the State are user-friendly and geared to the needs of individuals, rather than having rigid rules and bureaucracy. I ask for more flexibility to be provided in the appeals system.As the Minister is aware, the Irish Genealogical Research Society and the Genealogical Society of Ireland have raised some questions about the need to insert the maximum amount of information in all records, particularly death registration. It is felt that the insertion of more detail, such as a person's place of birth, would be most helpful. I ask the Minister to consider this area. The Bill also reflects matters already provided for in the Status of Children Act 1987.It is most important that the Bill reflects current realities. It is critical, for many reasons, that death certificates are issued as quickly as possible. It is imperative that this is done and that the process is expedited.I would like to ask about the provision of greater flexibility in the venues in which marriages are permitted to take place. Can the Minister indicate whether guidelines in this area will be issued? I broadly welcome this provision, as some of the offices in which marriages currently take place are less than attractive. In Waterford, City Hall was a wonderful venue for marriages, but permission to marry there was refused by officials not long ago. Is it intended that guidelines will indicate what type of venues can be used, or will it be open season, with only the consent of the registrar required?I look forward to the Minister's response to my questions. It is important that we get the details right and that we tease out many problems that may exist. In this instance, going from a manual to a computer-based system is to be welcomed, as it should improve and expedite the service to the public. I have not seen the amendments accepted on Committee Stage in the other House last night, but I am sure the Minister will be flexible about any amendments we put down.A colleague of mine recently gave me a copy of an American publication which contained an article headlined: "Irish citizens can now get records of births, deaths and marriages in just a matter of minutes". To highlight the simplification of the system, the article takes the example of a person who was born in Dublin but moves to "...County Donegal, a remote corner of northwestern Ireland." It states:Up until now, that person would have faced the unappealing prospect of a five-hour journey to the capital and the possibility of a long wait in the Civil Registration Office in order to get a copy of his or her birth certificate. Now, that person can go to the nearest branch of the Civil Registration Office, give the clerk a name and date of birth and have the certificate within minutes.That is what the Americans think about it. The mention of the assembly of historical records in the article was interesting. It states:That was accomplished over the course of three years, during which workers at a special center in County Roscommon scanned five million registration documents going back to 1845 and containing a total of 25 million records. Those records were then recorded in a separate, but linked, index database for ease of retrieval.It is wonderful to see that. One paragraph in the article sums up all our hopes:[The new system] has transformed a bureaucratic system that was once awash with paper into an efficient, streamlined operation and promises to deliver huge benefits to the Irish government and the population as a whole.We hope this will happen. I commend the Bill to the House.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I was getting carried away listening to the wonderful stories about north-west Donegal. I welcome the Minister. It is interesting to consider the picture of Ireland being broadcast to the world — the picture of what Ireland is becoming. The Minister gave an example of the arrival of a baby. The registration of his or her birth is automatically sent to the Department, a PPS number is allocated and there is automatic registration for child benefit, which is paid to the mother directly, as it is for subsequent children. One of the first things I did in this House after my election in 1997 was to try to convince the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to change the regulations dealing with child benefit that were in place at that time. In those days, if one did not apply for child benefit within the first three months of the child's birth, one did not receive it. If one wrote a letter saying one was not really with it, one might receive the money later.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	213	How many letters did the Senator write?
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Lots. However, we changed the system for the better, allowing six months during which parents may apply for child benefit. Now we are seeing what technology can do for customer service. Senators know what it was like to deal with the red tape and bureaucracy of many Departments, especially, in the past, the Department of Social Welfare. One might sometimes wonder whether it was worth it. Many people gave up and stopped fighting. The new system is a building block — in fact, it is probably the whole foundation — for some of the modernisation we are seeing. It is to be welcomed.It is time we stepped into the 21st century and had central databases of information. I recognise the amount of work that has been done all over the country and in various Departments in considering business process re-engineering. Many years ago, when Digital was in Galway, we used to hear new terminology on a weekly basis from the engineers and business managers: re-engineering, reprocess engineering, restructuring, business processes. Little did I know that as time moved on, we would see them being used to refer to new systems by the Government. It is a welcome development.I attended a conference about e-democracy on behalf of the Government approximately six years ago. The story I told then, having been briefed by the various Departments, was very different from what is happening now. We were not talking about the integration of databases, on-line processing of applications, or being able to register a birth in one location and obtaining details of it in another location. This system will allow for Irish people all over the world to check information. We have come into the technology age and this will make a big difference in terms of accessibility to our records.I compliment everyone who has been involved in the Bill. As I read through the Minister's speech and the aims and objectives she outlined in the Lower House, I recognised a proactive focus on change. What does the Bill actually do? It considers the area of administration and sets out the various offices that must continue. It deals with the servicing and preparation of the annual report of the civil registration system for the Minister for Health and Children and the Houses of the Oireachtas. It makes clear the divisions between an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the local health boards, which are renamed as the local registration authorities. It delegates certain functions currently performed by an tArd-Chláraitheoir to the superintendent registrars. It provides for the maintenance of the register of births, stillbirths, adoptions, deaths, marriages, decrees of divorce and decrees of civil nullity of marriage and the continuation in office of serving registrars. It has addressed these issues in a businesslike and clear manner.As the Minister has outlined, registration of a birth with any registrar instead of the registrar of the district in which the birth occurred makes absolute sense. It is good that we are in a position to facilitate this. An important point is the extension of the time limit for the registration of a birth from 42 days to three months. The limit of 42 days did not make sense in certain circumstances. These incidents were the exception, but they were not catered for. This is a welcome development and an indication of the increasing emphasis on practicality in the way we do our business. We are recognising that sometimes time limits need to be extended and technology is allowing us to make these extensions.Procedures are also outlined for the registration of the birth of an abandoned baby and for the registration of the details of a child's father where the parents of the child are not married to each other. The registration and late registration functions are devolved to a local level and it allows for the registration of certain births and stillbirths which occur on board an aircraft or at sea.There is the opportunity on Second Stage of a Bill to explore some of the issues around a Bill. Responsibility of fatherhood, already referred to on the other side of the House, is raised by this Bill. It is not simply about putting one's name on a birth certificate. It is about what is entailed if one fathers a child. It is not just about guardianship or custody of the child, but what direction society is going in. Is it acceptable to allow the State to take the responsibility for the role of the father in certain circumstances? I do not believe that is good enough. We must ask what is acceptable in this matter. What do we expect from people and what are their roles and responsibilities? This legislation is not the place to write this in, but the debate needs to be more focused. An attitude now prevails that it does not matter who the father of the child is if that person does not present themselves and that it does not matter that the girl in question, generally, is left with the responsibility of bringing that child up on her own, with the State expected to pick up the tab. That is not good enough. The Minister clearly outlined in the Lower House that research has shown that the most stable and best environment for children to be brought up is two-parent family units. However, we have made this huge step to where it does not matter anymore if the baby's father is not doing his job properly. This is not acceptable, we need to say so and there needs to be change. I do not have the answers to this issue. However, the debate must begin as to why it is unacceptable and how to impose responsibility on somebody who thinks it is good enough to leave the mother to carry the burden for the following 18 years after the child is born.The Bill addresses the issue of stillbirths. We have moved on from the old days when stillbirths were hidden and the child was not recognised as one. Hospitals have worked hard over the last number of years in dealing with this issue. A stillbirth will now be registered as a birth, which is important to those who have lost a child this way. The Bill proposes to extend the time limit for registration from three months to 12 months, which is also important. The extension of those who can act as qualified informants is an important step in accepting that sometimes parents are not in a position, even 12 months later, to deal with such sad circumstances. This is particularly the case if that birth had been awaited or there were previous miscarriages. It is important to recognise the changes that have been made in this area. The registration of adoptions is also covered in the Bill and the creation of indexes to allow traceability of parentage is an important development.With regard to the registration of deaths, I recall how I was contacted by a lady who had gone to her local registry office to get a copy of her father's death certificate. When she got it, the date of death was wrong, yet the official insisted it was the right date. It was badly handled, the customer service was not appropriate and the bureaucracy involved in changing the date was unacceptable. This Bill addresses that issue. The list of qualified informants can be extended to include undertakers. The time limit for registration is being extended from five days to three months. Again, in certain circumstances, five days does not make sense, particularly if it was an unexpected death or a case of multiple deaths caused by a road traffic accident. To expect such cases to be registered within five days does not make sense as the bereaved are not thinking about it at that stage. This Bill introduces provisions that are proactive, clear and practical.Senator Cummins was correct in his comments on marriages. The Ireland of today is different from 19th century Ireland. We need to address a number of issues in marriages such as venues, registration and the process involved in marriages. One of the great elements about Ireland and her culture is that we believe that two people, together in some form of marriage, make the best and most stable family unit. It is appropriate for us to continue to support the stability of those types of relationships. We must ensure that when people go into a marriage, they realise it is a commitment. Hopefully, it is a commitment for life because it is much better to be married to one person than to be married and go through a separation, divorce or an annulment.

#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The Bill states that a couple must attend in person at a registry office at least five days before the date of the intended marriage to declare that there is no known impediment to the marriage. I am not sure that having to do it within at least five days would be fair to Irish people living in America returning home to get married. As we know, in the United States, limited holiday time is available. If five days are used up before one comes home for a wedding, it does not leave much time to stay afterwards. I understand the Bill provides for the registrar to allow for less time. However, it needs to be clarified that this will not be the exception and that where people are travelling and not in the country it will be acceptable to attend the registry office one or two days beforehand to facilitate the marriage.I welcome the single universal procedure for the notification and registration of marriage which makes matters clear. The approved form of the ceremony is also another clear provision. It is interesting to note how multi-cultural our society has become, as the Bill provides for the provision of an interpreter if required. We are moving into the 21st century and recognising that our society has changed. Those getting married now come from different backgrounds and communities. It is not just a case of going to church to stand in front of a priest. The registration of divorce and the annulment of marriages is also catered for in the Bill which again reflects the changes from the 19th century to the 21st century.Other important and welcome provisions are the introduction of the new formal appeals system, the searches of the registers on the payment of a fee, the specific arrangements for the searching of the register of stillbirths — which needs to be handled diplomatically — and the arrangement for correction of entries in the register which will cut the bureaucratic red tape when mistakes are made. One provision, above and beyond the legislation itself, is the aim of a better customer service. This will be achieved through extended opening hours, better accessibility of services, the reduction of red tape and the once-off electronic capture and transmission of data which saves time. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs said it was about life-centred services to the customer. I congratulate her on this approach to the Bill. I also congratulate the people involved in drafting this detailed legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.

I am glad she accepted many changes to it during its progress through the Lower House. I hope she will accept a few more in this House.It is wise to keep one's wits about one in life, so that when it comes to looking at legislation, one can at least apply some practical notions to it. Members of the Church of Ireland have drawn to my attention that there will be a problem with section 51. This is not the Minister's fault. We have a 500 year old liturgy for the solemnisation of marriage which has featured in all the best films at that dramatic moment when the priest invites whoever knows any just impediment to the marriage to "speak now or forever hold his peace". In the Church of Ireland everyone looks at their feet and says nothing, but that will not do. This Bill suggests that we must say something. The Church of Ireland prayerbook is being reprinted so this would not just be a change of liturgy; it would be a grave financial loss. I hope that the Minister and her officials have found a way around this impediment. It never occurred to me previously although I have been to many Roman Catholic weddings that people say there is no impediment to the marriage. I hope the Minister will address that when she replies to the debate.One of the most important parts of this Bill is the section covering registration of births. Senator Cox made some very good points about this and how much more automatic it will be but there will be problems too because a distinction has been made between marital and non-marital births and 30% of births are non-marital. Until 1997 it was possible for all mothers, married or unmarried, to complete a registration form but leave the child's surname to be decided later. Now it appears that the surname must be put in at the time of registration within the hospital. Sometimes there can be awkwardness in non-marital births where paternity is not initially claimed but when the trouble calms down, the father of the child is quite enthusiastic about putting his name on the birth certificate. Under the terms of this Bill the unmarried mother must go with the father of the child to register in both their names or in a double-barrelled name. No change can be made on the registration form after that happens. Even if the parents marry, the short form of the birth certificate which is the one most people use in later life will show whatever was on the birth certificate at that time. Could this be rectified?In all legislation regarding registration of the child we are concerned with the rights of the child. The child's need to know his or her own father has become more obvious and important in recent years. For medical reasons this has come out in court. Mr. Justice Budd has written that a child is entitled to know his or her father when knowledge of genetics and hereditary diseases is rapidly developing. The child does not seek this knowledge in the hope that the father has become a rich American and he or she might inherit from him. It is extremely important knowledge from a practical point of view. We want to do everything to get as much information as possible for the child.Adding the PPS may cause difficulty so early in the procedure because some people might think it is being brought forward so that maintenance grants can be obtained. People think that way sometimes. We want to make it as easy as possible for the child to find his or her father. Double indexation should still be allowed. This helped widows in particular who might have used their own names, and those of first and second husbands. While we do not want children receiving two birth certificates, or in the case of a double-barrelled name three, double indexation could be very important so that not only the child, but also the family of the father, who may not have had such a close relationship with the child shortly after his or her birth, would be able to trace the child for reasons that could be beneficial to the child. The Minister would not want the children of an unmarried woman treated differently from those of a married woman. She would want them to be in the same position to access information about their parents.I am sorry that a guardianship register is not being set up particularly because of the position of surrogate children. I will table amendments on this issue. From the genealogical point of view, I wish we could have definite access to the hard copy indices, not just the computer indices. It should not be the position that a person "may" have access but that he or she "shall" have access. The Minister seems to be under a misapprehension when she states that the National Archives has access to the General Register Office information. This is not so; it has absolutely no access to the GRO. We can address those issues on Committee Stage. The rights of the child are paramount and what is the situation regarding surrogate children? Frequently they are born in the UK or the US and when they come here guardianship seems to be all they have.

I would laugh at it myself in some ways, but when I see the distress it has caused to Irish citizens it seems wrong. However, I will leave that for anotherday.The Minister has found a resolution to the Church of Ireland impediment because I was privy to a conversation between Senator Ross and Senator Mansergh this morning, both of whom had been approached by Bishop Colton. I was ignored, perhaps because I live in the slums and they went to public schools. Nobody came near me, but I am sure Senator Mansergh will be able to recount what resolution has been agreed.I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister. It is the first major legislation in this area since 1845 which is a long time ago. There is an argument for keeping records in their local base because they are most germane to that area and I remind the Minister that copies at least must be kept. When the Customs House burnt down one of the reasons so many Church of Ireland members could trace their ancestry was that many local vestries had not surrendered the original ledgers and so on. People were able to return to parish churches around the country and find them. In other words, they survived the centralisation. In a recent case involving the notorious doctor Sir Roy Meadow where it was suggested that an Irishwoman had murdered her child, local research showed that there was a syndrome of sudden infant death in that family which emerged only when the local registers were consulted.The chief issue is that to which Senator Henry referred: the discrimination between married and unmarried fathers in particular. Senator Henry mentioned amendments made available which she may put down and I understand these have been made available to Fine Gael.The reason I did not table them was that the person who contacted me said there was no Independent member on the committee, but there was a Fine Gael person so they were given to him or her. Whoever tables them, I will be happy to support them, but I will not table them. I hope the Minister takes them on board.Up to 1987 unmarried fathers could not be appointed as guardians of their own children unless they married the child's mother and adopted the child. Section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987 gave the courts power to appoint the father, which was an improvement. There was a further improvement in section 2 of the Children Act 1997 which provided that an unmarried father could be appointed guardian of his children with the mother's agreement if both signed a statutory declaration to that effect in the presence of a commissioner of oaths. Although that is a great improvement, there is no methodology for registering it.

It gave a great morale boost in my home town of Tipperary. I have never seen the people in such good mood as I saw them in the days following the decision. The various local bodies are busy putting together sites which they have been invited to send to the OPW. They are anxious to move ahead as fast as possible. If there was any disappointment in Tipperary, it was that Tipperary town's twin for this purpose, Carrick-on-Suir, was not included. However, there are some unallocated jobs, particularly in the information technology sector, related to that part of the south-east. I press the Minister and the Government to do what they can because Carrick-on-Suir needs decentralisation as badly as Tipperary town.While many of the towns chosen are contrary to those stated in the Fine Gael amendment, which are hubs or gateways in the national spatial strategy, not all of them are. Some of them are towns which have difficulty attracting replacement industry and which do not want to become dormitory towns. The national spatial strategy does not discuss in detail the subject of decentralisation. I am not sure it even specifically mentions it. Do I understand from the Fine Gael amendment to the motion that any town which is not a hub or gateway should not have been chosen for decentralisation? Was Senator Ulick Burke consulted about it, given the fact that the road haulage section and the National Safety Council is going to Loughrea because that is not a hub or gateway? Is Senator Finucane happy with the Fine Gael amendment, given that 50 Revenue staff are going to Newcastle West which is not a hub or gateway? Is the chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party happy, given that he claimed the credit more or less exclusively for himself for the 200 jobs going to Tipperary? The Fine Gael Party should consider amending its amendment.This is not only good for the towns chosen, but it is also good for Dublin. Anyone who travels to and from Dublin sees the queues which begin at Kill every morning during rush hour and continue for a couple of hours. It is intolerable. This is about relieving gross pressure on Dublin, which is a major element of the national spatial strategy. Decentralisation is fully in line with the national spatial strategy.It is also good for public administration and public servants. They must administer the country as a whole, like gardaí. It will not do them any harm to have direct experience of places other than Dublin during their careers as civil servants. Far from being bad for public administration, it will be exceptionally good for it. One has only to consider the French administration system, which is one of the finest in the world. Its staff members are sent off as prefects, and they go to prefectures in different parts of the country. It is thoroughly good for public administration. It may help those who move around and are flexible to qualify for the most senior jobs in due course.I am disappointed by the Labour Party's attitude to this issue. I listened carefully to the leader of the Labour Party on Sunday, 24 January. He called it a daft idea which would not work. He said it would be immensely expensive and counter-productive in terms of Government effectiveness and it would demoralise civil servants. He also said it would be bad for Government. The Labour Party says it will be the major force driving the next Government.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I second the motion. I thank Senator Mansergh for affording me the opportunity to speak on this issue. I congratulate the Government on taking this initiative which was promised a few years ago and which, because of the amount of work involved, took a long time to prepare and to finally unfold. I thank the Department officials, particularly those in the Department of Finance, who had direct responsibility for much of the preparation and who put in an enormous amount of work and effort over a number of years.In deciding on this relocation some years ago, the Government made a very wise and forward-looking decision. When it was first mooted it created considerable interest in the local communities, which organised themselves to put forward their case. In particular Kilrush Urban District Council spearheaded a campaign involving chambers of commerce and others. It is very frustrating for them to hear criticism of the decentralisation programme from the Labour Party, in particular, and Fine Gael. Huge work was put into preparing these cases and identifying locations for offices and the people for those offices.One of the most heartbreaking scenes in west Clare over 20 or 30 years has been the sight of busses lined up in the square in Kilrush to bring young people to Dublin to work on Sunday evenings. They then have to traipse all the way back down the following weekend. I am sure Senator Higgins has seen the same thing every week in Mayo. Due to advances in technology most of the work of such people can be done in any location around the country. This was proven in the Kilrush case where a detailed set of proposals was made to the Department. When it was felt it might be necessary to have a larger number involved to facilitate the transfer of civil servants to the west, they linked up with Newcastle West and Listowel.Deputy Deenihan, who represents Kerry North, was very disappointed by the Fine Gael response. Deputy John Bruton, as Minister for Finance, cancelled the decentralisation scheme, sold the sites that had been purchased for decentralisation and put back that scheme by 20 years. He was the main spokesman for Fine Gael on this issue at the time of the announcement and he has now continued the same negative approach to this operation as he had when he cancelled the scheme.I will give one example of the success of decentralisation. A number of years ago when we resurrected the scheme after Deputy John Bruton cancelled it, it was decided to relocate 1,200 civil servants to Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh. That scheme was completed very successfully meeting the needs of thousands of civil servants who had applied for a transfer. This gave a major boost to the economies of Nenagh and Ennis in particular. The decentralisation and the amalgamation of some other offices into the new State office block on the Kilrush road out of Ennis made a major contribution to the economic development of Ennis and was mainly responsible for the huge economic upsurge in the town in the past year since that took place. Not only was it successful in the economic revitalisation of Ennis — much of which at the time was run down and neglected — but together with urban renewal it is responsible for making Ennis the vibrant town it is today.That decentralisation scheme has been an outstanding success in meeting the requirements of hundreds of young people, especially those from County Clare who spent years on a waiting list seeking a transfer to Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh. When the Minister for Finance was in Kilrush at another function, he met a deputation of officials from the Revenue office in Limerick who had moved from Dublin. They pressed the Minister to urgently relocate people from Limerick to Kilrush, as many of them commute from west Clare to Limerick every day. Women rearing young families find this a serious burden and expense.The decision to link Newcastle West and Listowel with Kilrush has been very progressive and forward-looking. It is proposed to have 50 people in each location. I understand there is significant interest in the provision of these offices by people who are willing to put financial commitments behind the proposal and have already offered sites, buildings and land to facilitate this.I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they have done in this regard. I encourage them to press ahead as speedily as possible with the implementation of the decision. I want to nail the propaganda put out by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in particular, that this cannot and will not work. It has worked before and it will work again. I look forward to hearing a further announcement of decentralisation and the existing plan should be expedited to give people the prospect of working in their own locality resulting in enormous development in the towns that will benefit.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:"condemns the Government for its failure—to promote balanced regional development, particularly in relation to theBorder, Midlands and Western Region;—to meet the targets for infrastructural development as set down in the NDP;—to synchronise decentralisation plans with the National Spatial Strategy;—to consult with the public service unions in advance of the announcement of the decentralisation programme, resulting in a minimal uptake by civil servants; and—to maintain cost competitiveness in the economy, resulting in the wide scale relocation of industries to Eastern Europe and the consequent large number of job losses".I was astounded when I read the text of this Private Members' motion. I reiterate that I have no problem with decentralisation and with debating it. I have been promoting decentralisation for a considerable time and I agree totally with the concept. However, I was taken aback by the sheer arrogance and the wild inaccuracy of the construction of this motion.The motion commences by asserting that each region must have balanced regional development. The Government has been paying lip-service to the concept of balanced regional development for almost seven years. In reality regional development could not be more imbalanced than it is at present. The evidence exists in the starkest possible statistics — not mine but official ones. Between 1998 and 2000 employment in the west grew by 15.9% while employment in the south and east grew by 73.4%. How is that for balanced regional development? Both the ESRI and Indecon mid-term evaluations of the national development plan confirm that this hopelessly skewed imbalance has been maintained.Expenditure on support industry has achieved only 41% of the projected target in the BMW region. During the limited duration of the NDP, the spend on indigenous industry in the BMW region was just 47% of forecast, whereas in the south and east region the spend was 85% of forecast. How is that for balanced regional development? In the BMW region, the IDA got a derisory 15% of the forecast for support for foreign direct investment compared with 55% in the south and east. How is that an example of balanced regional development? To date, €8.2 billion or 77% of the total investment in the national development programme has been invested in the south and east, compared with €2.4 billion in the Border, midlands and western region. Talk of balanced regional development from the Government is a sop and a platitude because matters have not improved. Rather, the imbalance has become considerably greater.Last week, the National Roads Authority circulated an elaborately produced document which announced that a spend of €8 billion on the national road improvement programme kicks off in 2004. When one examines where the spend is targeted, it is again hopelessly skewed. For example, national road schemes completed in 2003 include the M1 at Cloughran-Lissenhall and Lissenhall-Balbriggan, the Drogheda bypass, the second Westlink bridge, the Celbridge interchange, the Kildare bypass, the Watergrasshill bypass, the Glen of the Downs dual carriageway, the Hurler's Cross-N19 Shannon access dual carriageway, the Youghal bypass and the Skibbereen bypass. Not one of those 11 projects is in the BMW region.The list of the national roads schemes to be completed in 2004 is the Hughestown-Meera road, the Strokestown-Longford road, the Naas Road-Kingswood interchange, the Monasterevin bypass, the Limerick southern ring-road; Parkway, Limerick; the Cashel bypass, the Ashford-Rathnew dual carriageway, the Ballycarty-Tralee road, the Ballincollig bypass, the Ballina-Bohola road and the Wyatville interchange. Of the 12 projects on this list, just two are in the BMW region. Just two of the national road schemes under construction as of 1 January 2004, of a total of 15 projects, are in the BMW region and the projections are no better.Paragraphs two and three of the Government motion state that the Seanad congratulates the Government for the commitment it continues to show in implementing the national development plan and bringing forward the national spatial strategy; and accepts that the locations which have been selected take full account of the national spatial strategy, the existence of good transport links — by road, rail and-or air — and the location of existing decentralised offices. Nothing could be further from the truth. Senator Mansergh made an attempt to defend this and demonstrate that there is synchronisation. A total of 53 centres were chosen for decentralisation. As we know, the national spatial strategy is based on gateway and hub towns. Some six gateway towns will benefit from decentralisation — Limerick, which is to get the Department of Foreign Affairs, Waterford, which is to get the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Sligo gets part of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Athlone gets the Department of Education and Science, Tullamore gets the Department of Finance and Mullingar gets the Department of Education and Science also. However, five crucial gateway towns are not included for decentralisation, namely, Galway, Cork, Letterkenny, Dundalk and the greater Dublin area.Of the hub towns, five have not been included for decentralisation, namely, Ballina, Castlebar, Ennis, Tralee and Tuam. For the Government motion to bravely assert that the locations selected for decentralisation take full account of the national spatial strategy is grossly misleading. The motion goes on to refer to the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis and the fact that there will be no redundancies. However, the uptake of relocation by civil servants has been minimal and I challenge the Minister of State to state how many public servants have opted for transfer down the country on a Department by Department and location by location basis. Based on figures published in the newspapers, it would seem only a trickle has gone.The whole project is commendable and has been needed for some time. However, to announce the transfer of 10,000 public servants out of Dublin to the country, without any advance discussions with the public service unions, is nothing other than ham-fisted. It was guaranteed, in the first instance, to generate hostility, cynicism and resistance from the unions. We are not moving numbers — we are moving people, many of whom are married and own homes in Dublin. Moreover, many spouses are public servants themselves or work elsewhere and, in many of these cases, second incomes are essential for paying mortgages. If these people move what guarantee is there that they can earn a second income?From the point of view of the efficiency of the Civil Service, this will lead to wholesale disruption and a negative response. The plan is good but the way in which it was introduced — without any consultation and in one fell swoop — is wrong and, unfortunately, I cannot see it working.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I draw the Government's attention to the adage that self praise is no praise. No one on this side of the House will praise the Government for its inactivity and broken promises since it was re-elected. The public knows what the Government promised and how little has been delivered upon.While we welcome the concept of decentralisation, there is a real fear it will never happen. The Government's decentralisation programme has all the hallmarks of a pre-election promise. The budget allocated for it is in the region of €20 million which, it appears, will not even move the furniture from Dublin to some of the Departments. This is a cynical promise by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to their candidates in the local and European elections because they are disappointed in the Government's performance since it was returned to office. They want some little trumpet to blow when they face the wrath of the electorate on the doorsteps. The electorate is angry. It is waiting in the long grass and on the doorsteps and the Government will get the message because there is no budget in place to implement decentralisation.It is difficult to see how 10,300 civil servants can be moved out of the city when the Government cannot fix the many schools which are in need of repair or even keep hospitals open. Just last week, more than 200 people were on trolleys in the eastern health board region alone and the same applies to the other seven health board regions. Crime is completely out of control, the Government cannot recruit the extra 2,000 gardaí it promised and there is no evidence of any coming on stream. At the same time, the Government wants us to believe it can decentralise 10,300 civil servants with the stroke of a pen when there is no timetable in place and no budget to implement the move. This is a distraction from the many stealth taxes contained in the budget, along with cuts in child care grants and community employment schemes. I could go on listing the cuts implemented by the Government until the cows come home.Improvements to the public service arising from the benchmarking process could be undone by the Government's programme for decentralisation and it may also result in shortfalls of expertise in the public service. If the programme is mishandled, it could result in technical and professional staff, who do not want to leave Dublin, being reassigned to inappropriate jobs, leaving skill shortages in key areas such as revenue, agriculture or probation.In a recent survey of 450 staff at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, just 124 respondents expressed an interest in relocating to the country. There is a danger of staff surpluses in all Departments as new workers will have to be recruited to fill the vacancies outside Dublin and this could result in a large number of public servants in Dublin with no function and no prospects of career advancement. This is a reality. The Tánaiste hinted in January that the targets for decentralisation could be reduced if staff resistance remained strong. There are worrying signs that, despite assurances to the contrary, decentralisation may not be voluntary and civil servants may be forced to move out of Dublin. Will we have a dictatorship imposed by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government?The national spatial strategy has been effectively ignored by the Government, as my colleague, Senator Higgins stated, to ensure the decentralisation programme has something in it for everyone. Where there is strong ministerial representation, the decentralisation programme was delivered as a plum. It is clear that the decentralisation locations reflect political favours and it is evident that the Government has abandoned its own spatial strategy.What has the Government achieved in the following areas, for example, the upgrading of the existing power grid? It was promised that the power grid would be extended to the BMW region, but this has not happened to date. The publication of the water quality report last week showed up the lack of investment in water services, particularly in the BMW region. The Government made promises on waste management and that there would be serious investment in waste management measures, but practically nothing has happened. It was proposed that spurs from the national gas grid would be extended to towns in the BMW region, but that has not been delivered. More resources were promised for e-commerce, but that has not been delivered.The provision of transport in rural areas is very important, especially for people living in isolation. I understand from those who manage the rural transport initiative that there is a serious shortage of funds. There is no provision for additional funding in this area. All in all the Government has behaved very badly. The national development plan has a strategy for making better use of what is already in existence such as the SHIPP programme in the mid-west and the TITAN programme in the south west. The Government is blowing its own trumpet and——

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I am very pleased to be here this evening to address this motion on decentralisation. The issue has been of considerable interest to Members of the House and I have participated in a number of Adjournment debates on the issue in the Seanad over the past few years.Since I initially announced the Government's decision to proceed with a new programme of decentralisation in December 1999, the issue of decentralisation has generated considerable interest both in and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas. Interestingly, the Government was, until 3 December last, on the receiving end of criticism for not having taken a decision, but since then we have been criticised on a number of spurious grounds. I intend to explain the background behind the decision which I announced on budget day and to address some of the criticisms made in the wake of that decision, including those included in the amendment to the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party.From the time that I first announced the Government's intention to proceed with a new programme, I was determined that it should be comprehensive, one which would have a real impact, address the issue of balanced regional development and make a statement about the Government's confidence in provincial Ireland. While my colleagues and I in Government were aware of a demand for decentralisation throughout the country, I am not sure that any of us could have anticipated its extent. I think by now that anybody with an interest in the issue knows that my Department received submissions from some 130 urban centres in every county in the country. In addition, hundreds of parliamentary questions and numerous Adjournment matters made the case for the inclusion of various towns throughout the country.The fact is that the Government has now taken its decision and all its attention is now focused on implementing it. On budget night, I announced the membership of an implementation committee, chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. Mr. Flynn's business and trade union background makes him an ideal person to chair such a committee. In addition, the other members of the committee bring a breadth of expertise which will be particularly beneficial in preparing the implementation plan.This committee has been hard at work since its establishment and has been charged with producing an implementation plan by the end of next month. I am fully aware of the onerous nature of this timescale, but the Government and I consider it important to build on the momentum which has been created by the programme's announcement.Senators will also be aware that a special Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation has been established, comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and me. The chairman of the implementation committee will report directly to the Cabinet sub-committee.Senators will also be aware that the Office of Public Works placed advertisements in the national newspapers in late December seeking proposals for suitable office accommodation or suitable sites with either planning permission or appropriate zoning. By the closing date for the submission of proposals, the OPW had received almost 680 proposals covering all 53 locations included in the new programme. I have this year provided a special sum of €20 million to meet any up-front investment in 2004. This is essentially a down payment on the Government's commitment to the programme's implementation.If there is one thing I want Senators to leave the House with this evening it is a very clear sense of the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the programme of decentralisation. While my Department has long had responsibility for the policy of decentralisation, individual Ministers are taking personal responsibility for the delivery of that part of the programme which comes within their respective remits. In this they are actively and fully supported by the Secretaries General of Departments and the heads of offices. I am absolutely confident that the combined commitment of the political and administrative heads of Departments will ensure that full and expeditious effect will be given to the Government's decision.There are those who would have one believe that the Government's decision was taken without any consideration for those most affected, the staff. This is simply untrue. From the very outset, I have been conscious of the tremendous human element involved. With this in mind I sought submissions from all of the Civil Service unions and took on board their observations. In addition, the Government took account of the observations of those heads of organisations who had previous experience of earlier phases of decentralisation. All of these external submissions, together with a lengthy internal examination, in the Department resulted in the overall plan which was unveiled on 3 December last.The Government has been concerned also with operating on a "joined up" basis and has a demonstrable record in following up on that objective. It is for this reason that the decentralisation programme was not developed in isolation from all the other areas of Government policy. For example, cognisance was taken of the national spatial strategy. In the agreed programme for Government, we made it clear that we would take account of the national spatial strategy and, as the motion points out, there is a clear connection between the national development plan and the national spatial strategy and now, in a very tangible and operational way, the decentralisation programme.It is also worth making the point that, when this programme is fully implemented, there will be a substantial presence of civil servants in virtually every gateway and hub. Furthermore, virtually all of the locations included in the programme are explicitly mentioned in the strategy. The Fine Gael amendment seems to suggest that only hub and gateway towns should have been included in the decentralisation programme. Those who hold such a view should tell that to the people of Portlaoise, Enniscorthy, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Listowel, Newcastle West, Dungarvan, Tipperary or Drogheda.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	255	This programme is, as much as anything else, about the promotion of balanced regional development. Why should those towns which have not been identified as hubs or gateways not share in that development? Do they not also have a convincing case for further prosperity? These questions, I suggest, answer themselves.This programme is a statement of the Government's confidence in provincial Ireland. It will not by itself bring about the kind of regional development the Government considers desirable but what it should do is give a lead to the private sector. There is an unhealthy imbalance of investment in and around Dublin and it is difficult for us, as a Government, to consistently encourage development outside Dublin if we ourselves are not prepared to show leadership.We have firmly demonstrated our commitment to the regions and now is the time for private investment to follow. All around the country we are seeing dramatic improvements in our physical infrastructure. I accept that there were infrastructural impediments to investment in some parts of the country in the past but the national development plan is delivering an infrastructure which will significantly overcome those impediments.In a few years, the investment in the NDP should be paying off handsomely with a much greater distribution of investment throughout the country and the consequent social and economic benefits which will follow. Notwithstanding the economic and social benefits which decentralisation can bring to those towns included in the programme and their environs, as well as Dublin, this programme is very much about people. These are the civil and public servants who will either relocate to one of the 53 locations or will choose to remain in Dublin.We have always acknowledged the people who work in our public service and they are central to the success of this programme. In formulating the principles of the programme, we therefore sought and received the views of all the Civil Service unions based on their past experience. Continuing the practice adopted in the past all moves will be on a voluntary basis and no removal expenses will be payable. There will be no redundancy or early retirement and those not willing to participate will be offered alternative public service jobs in the Dublin area.With regard to the programme's implementation, we have already commenced consultations not only with the Civil Service unions, but also with all the public service unions concerned, to ensure the smooth operation of the programme. I hope that we can continue to work with them to make the relocation process as smooth as possible.I assure staff that the recruitment and promotion structures which have served us all well over the years, will still continue to operate. What will have changed, and for the better, is that recruits and promotees from across the country will not be required to come to Dublin to secure either a position or promotion. The same level of promotions will continue to arise in the public service but they will be more fairly distributed across the country.There are those who have suggested that the programme will impact fatally on the efficient delivery of public services, but I cannot accept this contention. Two of those Departments or offices which most closely interact with the citizens of this country are already heavily decentralised, namely the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. We have, of course, learned lessons from their prior experience and these lessons will be put to good effect.However, the indisputable facts are that these organisations are providing, at the very least, as good a service from various provincial locations as they ever did in Dublin. The continued and, indeed, improved delivery of efficient public services is to the forefront of our minds and I am determined that nothing in this programme will in any way compromise the efficient delivery of public services.The strategic management initiative can only be improved by relocating the headquarters of eight Departments and the Office of Public Works outside Dublin. This relocation will bring the business of Government far closer to the people.For far too long, we have brought citizens to the work of Government but now is the time to reverse that practice. After all, we are talking about the public service, which serves people throughout the country and now it will operate among all the people.The forthcoming decentralisation programme is a radical and ambitious one, which represents a win-win situation for all involved. For 53 towns and localities throughout the country there is the prospect of significant economic and social benefits. I hope the programme will serve as a catalyst for further economic benefit in provincial Ireland. It will make a modest contribution to reducing congestion in our capital. For staff who wish to work outside Dublin, we are providing a unique opportunity, not alone to work outside the capital but also to develop and pursue their careers outside the city. For those who wish to remain in Dublin, there will be ample opportunity to do so, as well as continuing to pursue their legitimate career aspirations there.I would remind communities whose inhabitants may feel disappointed at not being included in this programme, that the Government has also decided that 500 health service posts — at a later stage in the restructuring of the health service — and approximately 830 IT posts, are also included. Furthermore, the Government has decided that, save in exceptional circumstances, all new public bodies should be located outside Dublin.As I said in my budget speech, I am convinced that the total number of posts to be relocated should be closer to 12,000 — significantly more than that indicated on budget day.I commend the motion to the House.

I remember his RTE broadcast on budget day, during which one of the commentators said that in the present circumstances it did not look as if there was room for the traditional McCreevy surprise in the budget. The commentator got that one wrong because the Minister most certainly did provide a surprise, which was most interesting and intriguing.I look on the motion as a waste of time in a sense, because it is a classic political exercise. We will not make any progress on this motion because it is black and white — one side will congratulate the Government while the other side condemns it. As an Independent Member, however, I do not particularly want to get into that.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I do not mind being interrupted at all, especially by the gracious lady on the front bench.The whole country is entitled to participate in our economic prosperity, which is one good argument for decentralisation. There are a great number of people from the country who may very well prefer to be in a rural environment, rather than in Dublin. I take that for granted but I am not quite so sure that the decentralisation programme was as well planned as the Minister is retrospectively making it out to have been.I have listened to discussions where prominent people, including a distinguished academic from UCD, suggested that the Minister's proposals were cutting across the national spatial strategy. That argument remains. Decentralisation has fed the cynicism of some people. There is no doubt — and one can even see it here — that people are mousing over the pickings in their own constituencies. If one examines the allocation of Departments, they are going to places that are very appropriate to the current incumbents of various ministerial posts. That is what has happened and there is no argument about it. It leads, however, to a certain degree of cynicism, of which I share an element.While I accept the principle of decentralisation — obviously, it is unhealthy that Dublin is so top heavy — I am not sure the programme has been sufficiently prepared. There was a degree of political opportunism, which I do not like, and which does not recommend the programme to the general public. In addition, there are some specific problems, which the Minister has not completely addressed. As a humane person, the Minister has consulted people and has taken the human element into consideration but I would draw to his attention a particular case of which I have heard. I have to confess that I listen a great deal to the wireless and the case I heard concerned a woman who was married to a highly skilled cartographer in Ordnance Survey Ireland. The woman concerned had a job in Dublin, which would be difficult to replicate down the country, and her children were attending school, which is another human problem. The real nub of the problem, however, was that if the man decided he did not want to leave Dublin and the Ordnance Survey was decentralised, what would he be left doing. For whom would he draw maps — the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? This is where decentralisation hits a crunch point because I do not know how such people will be accommodated. It is a real human problem, which needs to be addressed.How about decentralising a few offices to the north side of Dublin? What will the Minister do with the Custom House and Tyrone House when the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Education and Science, respectively, vacate them? What will happen to those superb 18th century buildings that are landmark sites? Will they be flogged off? Will we put a funfair in them or lease them to McDonalds? I would like to know what will be their fate. I listened with respect to my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil side, and they made a very good argument, particularly Senators Daly and Mansergh, regarding the vitality brought to local areas by the migration of these Departments. That is absolutely true, but why is everything being stripped out of the north side of Ireland's capital city? The only two Departments on the north side are being taken away, and we will be left with the empty shells of buildings. Those areas are just as deprived as any provincial area of the country, and I want to know why we are not committing ourselves to revitalisation of the north inner city of Dublin, where there is a substantial drugs problem apart from anything else. The Government needs to build up that area instead of stripping everything out of it.

I certainly agree, but unfortunately it has very little impact on the area, and that is a problem. I accept what the Senator says and admit that I was one of the critics. I thought that it was a white elephant, and I absolutely accept that I was wrong. I am glad it is there, but it does not have sufficient spin-off in the area.There is another specific matter which I want to raise and which I ask the Minister to examine. I do not expect an answer this evening, since I do not think it is possible to give one, however, I would be grateful if the Minister could examine why the Equality Authority is going to Roscrea. I do not think Roscrea is a place where human rights abuses may not occur or where there may not be people quite well qualified to service the area. I am not putting it in the same light as moving the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to one of the few landlocked counties, although some people did think that slightly absurd. This is not as absurd as that decision, but I want to know why it is leaving Dublin. I believe there is something sinister behind this and that the Government intends to demote or destroy the Equality Authority. The first reason is that it is being decentralised to Roscrea when it is perfectly obvious it is an agency of the State that needs clear, efficient interaction with all other organs of Government. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is staying in Dublin.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	263	No, 200 staff members are going to Tipperary.

I hope they take some of the creatures that we see in here sometimes; they will be grand down in Roscrea. In fact, the Senator can have the whole damn lot of them if he wants them. That the authority is being decentralised to Roscrea while the Department is largely staying here is significant. It is being taken away from the area where it fits in organically.The authority did very good work with the report on equality for gay people. The gay person on it has been replaced by a Progressive Democrats candidate in the local elections who interrupted a question to another candidate on "The Late Late Show" to say that he could not possibly countenance the recognition of domestic partnerships, something to which the majority of parties in this State are committed. What are they at, and why are they undermining this very important agency? Is it lack of finance? Does the Minister know? Why is it taking on no new cases?The Equality Authority was a marvellous thing. It was ahead of the rest of Europe and something of which we could be proud. I am very much afraid that, masked by decentralisation, this very important agency which gave hope to downtrodden groups will itself be marginalised and ultimately extinguished. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure me, either in writing or in some other way, that this Equality Authority is not being deliberately destroyed, because that is what it looks like to me and many people whom I represent, by no means all of them gay. That is also how it looks to many people in the Equality Authority, and I feel it appropriate to signal that in this House tonight.

The Minister gave the reason himself when he replied that, the best way to exhort investors to put money into the country and set up factories and so on outside Dublin was to lead by example. That is precisely what the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government have done. It was a reforming and absolutely visionary decision. To my colleague across the Chamber, Senator Bannon, I say that it is timely that this motion has been tabled, since the decision has now been taken by the Government, and it is now time for the private sector to honour its side of the bargain, since we have kept ours. Members on the other side said that it would not happen. Perhaps they hope it will not happen, but they will be disappointed. Regarding people not being happy, I do not know which poll results Senator Bannon was examining, but they must be different from those that I saw.The decision to locate staff, for example, in my own town of Mullingar, as well as Athlone, was timely. We in Mullingar and Westmeath have no Minister. We have three very active Oireachtas Members, Senator O'Rourke, Deputy Cassidy and myself, and I suppose that, no more than other Members of both Houses, we spent a great deal of our time — I certainly did — lobbying the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on this decision. I make no apologies to anyone for that.

I know the Senator will be disappointed, but we will deliver. I thank the Minister once more for this very innovative decision that will have far-reaching positive implications. How many Members of this House or the other House have not been approached by people in Dublin who wish to relocate to the country? In my 25 years in public life, I have met many of them.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I thank Senator Glynn for sharing time with me. In supporting the motion, I am keenly aware that what we are really dealing with here is a good-news story that has captured the whole country's imagination. When it was announced by the Minister for Finance, no one envisaged anything as ambitious or extensive. I find it slightly ironic — I do not mean the debate in the House — how we dissect and analyse this decision when, over the years, industry, national institutions, transport infrastructure and everything else moved into Dublin without anyone questioning for one moment why that was happening. Of course it is a radical decision, but if we are talking about regional development, there is no point any more in cosmetic remedies, because they will not work. We have seen where they have been employed that down the road further difficulties have arisen.I am delighted that we have this elaborate decentralisation programme not just because of the services which, or the number of people who, will move into the given area, but because of the other developments which are bound to follow from it. This will gather momentum as time goes on. If I was to make one appeal more than any other — I am sure each Member would like to see this move as expeditiously as possible and I have no doubt it will happen — it would be to help the people who will move into those areas to acquire houses without any obstruction. I am thinking particularly of rural Ireland. I believe an announcement is imminent on a less tight regime in regard to planning and one off houses in rural Ireland.It is vitally important that happens because there are many people in Dublin who would be attracted to the country if they felt they could have the quality of life one finds in rural Ireland. Unfortunately, there is the perception abroad, which is very much an urban one, that provincial and rural Ireland is, in some way, a primitive reservation for second-class citizens. Nothing could be further from the truth. Anybody who has put up with what has happened in Dublin over the past 20 years or so knows there is a real quality of life for the individual, family and community in rural Ireland. It is absolutely vital that, as part of the package, the news we expect — I hope it will be interesting — will endeavour to help those people who want to build or purchase a house in rural Ireland.We often talk about a quality of life in an artistic or a cultural sense. The same applies here in that rural Ireland, by and large, has been the custodian of many of our traditions. It has been the custodian of a quality of life which very often does not come under the same onslaught as might happen in the capital.There is a perception in rural Ireland that if something happens in Dublin, it is big or tragic news but if it happens in rural Ireland, that is not the case. An example of that — I am not taking from the trauma involved — is if there is a flood in Dublin, one would think from the media that the whole island was going to sink. If there is a flood down the country, it, and its consequences, are ignored. The reason is that the media, by and large, are so close to what is happening in Dublin. I remember a "Late Late Show" when Gay Byrne was in charge of the programme. A debate was taking place and a particular senior politician, whose name or party I will not mention, arrived in the studio without an invitation and went straight up to join the panel to participate in the discussion. He said he was watching the programme at home, felt strongly about what he heard and had to come in to participate. What about the person in Cashel, Ballina or Cork? They could not do likewise.The message being sent here is not just a vote of confidence in provincial Ireland. It is also sending a signal that, once and for all, there will be a greater balance and spread of whatever is available. Members may have noticed that few people in Dublin criticised the decision. The reason is that they know well that Dublin is absolutely saturated. One can talk about gridlock and the remedies but the wise man and woman on the street warned 25 years ago that we were pushing too much into Dublin and that the day of reckoning would eventually come. We are, once and for all, dealing with a good news and a radical story. What is important now is to put a positive spin on it and to put the shoulder to the wheel. This is just the start of many aspects of decentralisation.

Sometimes Fianna Fáil persuades people, as it did in the last general election, and then must face the truth afterwards. This time, I suspect, it is not persuading people. The obviously inappropriate response from the public gallery, but nevertheless very indicative response, to Senator Norris's point that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be based in one of the few landlocked counties suggests that the public has copped on to what this is all about.

My party in Government decided to do something about real decentralisation in the Education Act which was passed in the 1992-97 period. It decided to decentralise power in education. Packing civil servants around the country is not decentralising power; it is decentralising civil servants. This Government believes, as did its predecessor, in centralising power. It has taken power away from health boards and local authorities and from local education authorities which would have decentralised education because it said it was too expensive and would cost €20 million.The Government cannot tell us how much this exercise will cost. The Department of Finance, which is so good at telling everybody else how much things should cost, does not know how much this programme will cost. This is the Department which lectures the rest of us and the Houses of the Oireachtas and tells Members of the Oireachtas what they are entitled to claim in expenses, but which does not know what the decentralisation exercise will cost. The reason is that it was thought up by politicians as a political gimmick three days before the budget.

Fianna Fáil knows about rubbish.There is a succession of agencies here. I am concerned that we have a grossly over-centralised system of Government, not a system of administration. We are doing nothing about that because the Department whose Minister is the author of this is the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe. It believes that the centre knows best for everybody, which is the reason it wants to control everything, including every Department and every major decision in every Department, and to retain centralised control over every decision taken by local government.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	294	That is a fact. All legislation which comes through this House states that where expenditure is involved in the Department, it is subject to the control of the Minister for Finance as if there was some superior wisdom in that Department. If we want to decentralise, the first thing we must do is decentralise power. If one decentralises power and authority, one then creates increased numbers of public servants in various areas. That works and is real, effective and efficient. This is an exercise in tokenism, a large part of which I hope will never be implemented because it will be a disaster for the efficiency of public servants.The Minister cited two examples — the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. They have been decentralised because they provide a regional office to provide a regional service to people in the regions.

The CSO has been an extraordinarily successful transfer because it is an integrated body, most of whose work is done within the body. What use will the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister be in County Cavan, travelling in droves up and down to Dublin each time an Oireachtas committee wants to meet them or the Minister wants to come to Dublin, etc? It is a spurious idea.If the Government wants to decentralise power, it should strengthen local government, which it has resolutely refused to do, choosing instead to engage in a token exercise which most people know will not work. The Department also knows it will not work because the Department of Finance will not put a figure on the cost. Has anybody ever heard of the Department of Finance supporting a project for which it did not know the cost, in this case the costs associated with civil servants commuting between various parts of the country and of having essentially two senior staffs in each Department, with a Secretary General in Dublin and another in Cork, Cavan or elsewhere? To ensure the system does not fall apart, parallel administrations will be required in Dublin and the region in question.One could argue about the merits of decentralising some of the agencies selected. The fundamental thrust of the proposal, the movement of the headquarters of Departments, is profoundly bad for public administration but good for the image of the Fianna Fáil Party as we approach local elections in which it will receive a hammering. The party hopes the decentralisation announcement will bail it out in a few specific cases.

Neither of us is in a position to speak on the matter and we should not pursue it any further.The Minister of State stated that people who do not want to move will be offered alternative public service jobs in Dublin. A significant number of the agencies in question, as distinct from the Civil Service, are specialised. They include, for example, the Equality Authority, the Arts Council and similar bodies. According to the Minister of State, employees of these agencies who do not wish to move will be offered alternative public service jobs in Dublin. What will staff of Bord Bia, the Arts Council, An Bord Glas, Bord Iascaigh Mara and other specialist agencies do if they do not want to move? Will specialist public servants with specialist technical knowledge fill jobs in the manner in which certain staff in the Land Commission did for years following its abolition because nobody could think of anything for them to do?The thinking behind the proposal makes little sense, is fundamentally illogical and betrays the absence of enthusiasm by the Department of Finance, given that it has not yet put a cost on the plans.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion, which I support, and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Decentralisation is an integral part of the Government's commitment to balanced regional development. I am delighted civil servants and their families will relocate throughout the regions as part of the programme. I wholeheartedly agree that balanced regional development is an essential way forward and congratulate the Minister for Finance on his foresight in decentralising Departments from Dublin. The advantages of transferring entire Departments include ease of promotion, accessibility to services for those who need them most and tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to regional balance across 25 counties.Although it does not represent an end in itself, decentralisation is a beginning and a method by which we can continue to progress the significant efforts we have already made in tackling some of the serious regional imbalances which have developed over many decades. History will record that members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in Government, were the pioneers in attempting to successfully address regional imbalance, starting in 1989 with the decentralisation programme which has proven to be such a success and continuing with the developments contained in budget 2004.I am satisfied that the units being transferred under decentralisation are sufficiently large to provide career opportunities for staff in their current Department or another Department within a reasonable commutable distance. As this decentralisation programme is aimed at all levels of civil servants, progressive civil servants can look forward with confidence to good career prospects and opportunities outside Dublin. It could be argued that this issue was a neglected prerequisite for the decentralisation programme of 1989.Too much of our public administration is still concentrated in the capital. We bear witness to the pressures placed on public services and the quality of life in Dublin caused by rapid population growth. In rural and regional Ireland the opposite is taking place. The regions have been subjected to massive depopulation trends, which have perpetuated a brain drain and resource drain to the east coast. Governments led by the Fianna Fáil Party were the first and only Governments to recognise consistently that this is a pattern of development which is neither economically efficient nor socially sustainable. I commend them on the implementation, initially in 1989 and more recently in budget 2004 of one of the most obvious solutions to the problem.Given advances in and dependence on information technology, there is no reason Departments should remain in Dublin rather than carry out their business in an equally convenient rural or regional location. This, in turn, will help to correct regional imbalances. The Fianna Fáil Party in Government has again taken the necessary steps in this regard. We have a proud record of decentralisation and sections of Departments already moved have been outstanding successes.Approximately 34,000 civil servants and 2,500 public servants are currently employed in the non-commercial, State sponsored bodies. Following the earlier programme of decentralisation of Departments and the well established presence of regional and local offices of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, some 14,000 civil servants located outside Dublin. Effectively, therefore, almost 40% of the Civil Service is already located in the provinces. This demonstrates how we have led by example in attracting foreign direct investment and encouraging indigenous industry to locate in rural and regional areas. If the State shows that it can successfully make the regions as attractive as the capital, foreign direct investment and indigenous investment will follow.Already we can see the effects of budget 2004 on investment throughout the regions. A significant number of indigenous and multinational employers have started to look beyond Dublin to more cost effective regional locations. The implementation of decentralisation by the Government is a win-win proposition for all involved. It will make a contribution to reducing city centre congestion in Dublin and will be a statement of the Government's intent in this regard. It will provide a significant boost to those centres in which Departments will be relocated and beyond as people choose to live in neighbouring towns and villages. It will bring economic benefits to the regions and, I hope, act as a powerful catalyst for further economic growth in towns throughout the country. The decentralisation of Government offices will also have a positive effect on the quality of life as towns and villages are revitalised.I support the provision that the transfer of civil servants under the decentralisation programme will take place on a voluntary basis. It is important we satisfy all components of social partnership when we advocate moving such a significant number of civil servants from the capital. I am pleased that consultations have taken place and will continue to take place between the relevant trade unions and Government representatives to ensure the relocation will run as smoothly as possible and on a voluntary basis only.While I fully support the decentralisation proposals, many challenges must still be addressed. One such issue is the infrastructural questions which surround aspects of the national development plan. I advocate the speedy implementation of the national infrastructure Bill, which could put to an end to the objections of groups restricting the progress of the NDP and holding the majority to ransom. The longer the full potential of the NDP is curbed by tenacious protesters and ulterior motivated objectors, the greater will be the effect on the provision of the infrastructure required to complement the relocation of civil servants nationwide and the national spatial strategy as a whole. I suggest we press for an early debate on the national infrastructure Bill in order that the Government's plans to decentralise Departments and offices realise their maximum potential.We also face challenges with regard to the national spatial strategy, which offers another excellent opportunity to further build on the work we have already done to address the regional imbalance. I wholeheartedly congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the spatial strategy. We must ensure we meet our responsibility to ensure that all arms of the State — semi-State bodies, local authorities and Departments — buy into the strategy and its principles. I respectfully suggest that legislation may be required to ensure this occurs in light of the behaviour of some of these bodies in the past. Iarnród Éireann, for example, took decisions about downgrading freight and various other matters which did not appear to be consistent with the overall aims and principles of the spatial strategy. We have a responsibility to address this and I ask the Minister of State to discuss with his colleagues whether a legislative umbrella could be introduced to allow all arms of the State to buy into the strategy and act in unison with its aims and principles when conducting their business.Budget 2004 is a major step towards achieving the full decentralisation of Departments. The challenges must be addressed. I suggest that regional re-balancing be supported by legislative structures which tie in all aspects of Government's commitment to regional development. I reiterate my support for this Private Members' motion. I congratulate the Government and the progressive and proactive steps taken to date to ensure that the prosperity of the east coast continues but not necessarily at the expense of the BMW region and the other regions which need this investment.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the motion and the amendment. I have addressed the question of decentralisation on numerous occasions both in this House and in the other House. I am supportive of the broad concept of decentralisation. The programme of decentralisation was announced by the Minister in his Budget Statement last December to the surprise of many.In my view, approximately half the announcements and the proposals are reasoned, reasonable and real. They are workable and they will work. I regret to conclude that the other half or at least a majority of the remaining half will turn out to be political pet projects, cruel con jobs which will not work, in my view.If the Minister of State requires proof of my argument, I ask him and his colleague to consider the announcement with respect to Mitchelstown. The Minister of State will be familiar with that town when he wears his agricultural hat. The town has recently suffered and is continuing to suffer a significant degree of job losses. There was some surprise in the town and in my view there was some surprise politically at the announcement made by the Minister for Finance that 200 jobs would be decentralised from the Bus Éireann headquarters in Dublin to Mitchelstown which is to become the new centre for Bus Éireann. This was welcome news for Mitchelstown and the region and welcomed by all concerned for the future of Mitchelstown.There are fewer than 100 people working in the Bus Éireann headquarters in Dublin. There have been many political riddles from this Government and from the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, but will the Minister of State explain the riddle of how 200 jobs will move from Bus Éireann headquarters to Mitchelstown when fewer than 100 people work in Bus Éireann headquarters? I regard this as a cruel, political con trick.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	309	We are advised that 200 people will move from headquarters. Unless the Minister of State insists that all the bus drivers will move to live in Mitchelstown, there has been no talk of Bus Éireann employees in other parts of the country being moved. It was announced that the headquarters of Bus Éireann would move to Mitchelstown and it would require 200 staff to run that head office whereas fewer than 100 staff are currently employed in the Dublin head office. I ask the Minister of State to be real in his comments.I hope the Mitchelstown example will not be repeated in other projects. The Minister announced a figure of 12,000 or 14,000. We should start from the premise of working with facts. I am disappointed that the people of Mitchelstown are being conned by this Government. The figures as announced are a gross distortion of facts but I hope the 90 or 100 staff will move to Mitchelstown where they are needed and will be welcomed.The Minister of State said there were complaints that the consultation process had gone on too long but it is a necessary process. In response to parliamentary questions asked over a year ago, there was an indication that approximately 10,000 civil servants had indicated a desire to move to provincial locations. There is a significant number of people both in Departments and in semi-State offices who would like to move to rural and provincial locations. It remains to be seen whether that desire to move can be married with the announcements. The indications from offices and particularly from head offices which are due to move, is that the numbers are not yet adding up. The programme of decentralisation is laudable but we must be realistic. I hope the figures I have presented in respect of Mitchelstown will not be replicated across other agencies and other Departments. I was impressed by the announcement to move 200 staff fromBus Éireann headquarters and I am disappointed to learn it was a mirage rather than a real project.

There was a substantial welcome for that proposal from all sides of the House. More balanced regional and local development is required and the spatial strategy will play a significant role in that regard. The town of Mallow has been designated as a hub town and was very fortunate in being chosen for decentralisation. Decentralised offices should be centred in gateway and hub towns where possible.

In order to be consistent with what was said 12 or 18 months ago, the starting point should be the gateway and hub towns. It is surprising that some of those towns have been left out of this programme.While the concept of decentralisation is positive and there are thousands of civil servants who would be interested in moving to provincial locations, there is a difficulty in matching the people to the moves. Much work is required if what the Minister said on 3 December is to turn out to be real. I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours and ask him to answer my query about Mitchelstown. I ask him not to waste his time telling me about jobs from other sections of Bus Éireann. The Minister made a promise which was repeated locally as late as last Friday night in the presence of the Taoiseach by the Government representative for Mitchelstown, that the headquarters of Bus Éireann would be moving to Mitchelstown and would be providing 200 jobs.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this subject. I am a supporter of the spatial strategy and I am an advocate of the Government's policy in that regard. I am a long-time supporter of the decentralisation process, going back to before I entered the Oireachtas in 1989. I have always regarded it as being of benefit to the country. It is the case that one third of the population is living in one little corner in Dublin and overflowing into the adjoining counties. It is not healthy and it is not good for the country. The population should be evenly distributed.Some of my colleagues were surprised at the attitude of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to this motion. They should not be because Fine Gael and the Labour Party are consistent in their attitude to decentralisation; they have always been against it and they are still against it. I am amazed at how out of touch they are with the wishes of the people. They have proven tonight that they are out of touch.Over the years, perhaps civil servants have not wanted to leave Dublin because it was more difficult to do so. Our regional towns and cities were not as well developed and the idea of moving around the country might not have been as attractive as it is now. Ireland has changed completely in recent years and its towns and cities have been developed. People require schools, good restaurants and pubs, shopping facilities and recreational amenities, all of which are now available in the regions, within a short distance of most people's homes. It is evident that there will be more facilities in a place like Dublin, because of its sheer size, but everything is available in the regions now. The prospect of moving out of Dublin is now attractive for most people. They know they will not be discommoded by finding that certain services are unavailable.It is not as difficult as it once was to persuade civil servants to move from Dublin. They are familiar with the experiences of their colleagues who have already moved. I would like to query some of the figures that have been cited in this regard. It has emerged that when those working in Departments were asked if they want to move to places like Ennis and Shannon, just 2% or 3% of them said that they were willing to do so. It may be the case that they are unwilling to move to the towns about which they were asked, but they may be keen to go to plenty of other places. They should be asked if they want to decentralise.The Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and many of his senior officials attended a joint committee meeting yesterday. The Secretary General said that when an initial trawl of the Department was conducted — the survey did not encourage anybody to move — 30% of its civil servants said they were willing to decentralise. They may not necessarily want to move to Cavan, where the Department will be located, but they want to decentralise. We are well on the way to meeting the target numbers for decentralisation because people want to go.I recall that when I said to a civil servant who had moved to the Land Registry in Waterford that I was unaware that she was from the Waterford region, she said that neither her nor her husband were from the region. They had examined the possibility of moving to the region, for example by comparing the type of house they could buy in Waterford to the house in which they lived in Dublin. The traffic problems they experienced in Dublin do not exist in Waterford. They decided they could enjoy a far better lifestyle in Waterford and they are now quite happy.The experience I have outlined is replicated in every town and city throughout the country. Civil servants who have moved are quite happy with what they have done. We are looking for 10,000 people to move and I do not think we will have a problem in that regard. It is obvious that civil servants will transfer across Departments, which has always happened. The Government's decision to proceed with the decentralisation programme is a marvellous one. I fully support the motion before the House.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I endorse the motion before the House. I am happy to outline why I feel that the proposed programme of decentralisation is the best way forward.I live in Dublin. I travelled to Bray at 8 a.m. the other day, but the return journey, at 8.45 a.m., nearly did my head in. I had time to do a great deal of thinking, because the journey from Bray to the centre of town took an hour and a half. I immediately started to wonder how we will live like this for the rest of our lives. If Dublin continues to grow in this way, over 50% of everything will be in the city, which is already top-heavy. It is difficult to go anywhere in Dublin. If one wants to go to a restaurant, one might have to book ten days in advance to be sure of getting a table. It is a constant effort to get from A to B if one wants to go to a function, for example. Young people who have just finished college often come to me to explain that they would love to work somewhere other than Dublin, but no jobs are available in such locations. There are great opportunities in the Civil Service, but most of them are located in Dublin. We have a golden opportunity to bring about a change in this regard and we should facilitate that.The decentralisation of Civil Service jobs is voluntary. Nobody is being forced from Dublin to work in another location. Civil servants have a choice. People are grabbing this opportunity because they want to move to another location. There is no comparison between the quality of life of young people who live in the country and that of those who live in Dublin. The social life in regional areas is superb, comparatively speaking. Many types of jobs will be available in decentralised offices. I welcome the Minister's statement that there are opportunities for career development within the Civil Service. The problem of limited opportunities will cease to exist. We have to go with the flow.I congratulate the Government on taking this lead, because there is a huge imbalance. I call on private sector employers to promote decentralisation, rather than concentrating their jobs in Dublin and along the east coast. We should spread the opportunities. This is a beautiful country. We should get the balance right. The flow of jobs should be to provincial areas rather than to the city. Dublin is already defunct as a top city. It is a lovely city to live in, but the quality of life is no longer there. I congratulate the Minister and I hope we will move this process forward fairly quickly.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I am delighted to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate. I have given serious consideration to supporting the Government motion, but I have a personal rule about Private Members' motions which congratulate the Government — they are impossible to support. The Government's approach gives the fingers to the other side of the House. I always appeal to Governments not to propose such motions. Although the Government's decentralisation policy has many good aspects, I do not think it is a cause for congratulation. There is more to support in the decentralisation programme than there is to oppose.I do not think the Government's case has been well served by some of the arguments that have been made this evening. I appreciate that Senator Ormonde made many valid points, with which I do not argue, but her contribution reflects a certain type of view. I do not mean this in a demeaning way. Many people argue that because we cannot move on the roads or get into a restaurant, we should move all that crowd down the country to make a bit of space for the rest of us living here.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	319	No, that is not true.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Such an argument sounds better from those who do not intend to stay here. I may not have reflected exactly the points made by Senator Ormonde, but I am pointing out what comes across to me when I hear such speeches. The Dublin-centric view of society holds that we should make space for those of us who have a right to be here. It is a difficult issue.We could be doing many things that we are not doing in this House. I have failed to start any movement in respect of the committees of these Houses. Joint committees should meet outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, just as committees of other Parliaments meet in provincial locations. I do not mean that committee members should visit such locations to meet local people or other groups, but that they should have actual meetings in other parts of the country. I pleaded with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to hold a certain number of its formal meetings in Gaeltacht areas each year. I am not referring to ordinary meetings with people.The fact that there is no presidential residence other that in the Phoenix Park is a reflection of the Dublin-centric attitude to which I referred. I am aware that the Constitution requires the President to live in Dublin, or near Dublin. I do not think the Minister of State will disagree with me when I say that every time I pass Portumna Castle——

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	329	We need to examine these things. It will be impossible to implement the decentralisation proposal in three years. The idea that this can be achieved has raised people's hackles. This regularly happens when a good idea is brought forward. There should be a discussion on the principle of the issue and a discussion on its implementation. Everybody gets confused when the principle is lost because implementation difficulties are encountered. It is a fact that this cannot be done in three years, but I think it could be done in ten years. I believe that approximately one quarter of those working in Departments in Dublin would be happy to move from Dublin. New recruits could be located outside Dublin over a ten-year period, which is approximately one quarter of a career. The target can be met by natural evolution. Approximately half of a Department could be located elsewhere in this way, which involves evolution and voluntary movement, rather than persuasion. If one told people to proceed in this way, but to move to Dublin if they wanted further promotion, one would suddenly encounter a completely different attitude. People will no longer want to rush to Dublin if they can be promoted to a senior position in their provincial bases. We need to consider the matter in this light.The implementation of the plan should take place in a much more organic fashion. Senator Bradford pointed out that somebody had promised 200 jobs in a place where there were only 80 people working. If this is true, it brings the whole thing into disrepute. Knowing Senator Bradford, I do not think he would have brought forward that suggestion if he did not believe it to be true.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	331	If we are wrong about it, somebody should tell us we are wrong. These things are important. We need to consider decentralisation as a proactive measure that ties into other plans. I do not believe it ties into the national spatial strategy. It is not complementary to the strategy at all — in many cases it is quite the opposite, filling gaps left by the spatial strategy in order to satisfy people. That will not work.I regret that on an issue on which there is, in principle, all-party agreement, there is total division on the matter of implementation. There is something wrong there. It is a matter of change management. I agree with many of the points the Minister made earlier, but I have some reservations. Senator Mansergh and I, wearing other hats, have considered the strategic management initiatives over the years, a core principle of which was change management. There is no evidence of any kind of proper change management in what we have heard so far about the implementation of this very good idea. That is the problem. Nobody can disagree with the principle of decentralisation. Nobody so far in the debate has dared to say he or she is opposed to it. All the opposition has been based on the detail. This will always be the case, but it is a pity we cannot obtain agreement on implementation.Decentralisation will simply not happen in three years. In three years, whoever is on this side of the House will stand up and accuse the Government of saying it would happen when it did not. The same debate will continue endlessly, in a circular fashion, without a solution ever being found. People will justify what they did and blame other people. We should recognise that it is too big a project to implement in three years and that it cannot be done in that time. We should reassess the whole plan. It is a good idea and has substantial support — in fact, it easily has the support of the majority — but its implementation must be reconsidered. It will not be implemented in the face of so much opposition.I agree that some of the comments made about certain places are utterly unacceptable. There is nothing wrong with putting the Equality Authority in Roscrea if that is the final decision. I do not see what point anyone could make about that. Nobody can say that they wanted another Department to come to Carlow or anything of that sort. Some of us represent a constituency that covers all of Ireland and beyond and we have a respect for all these places. There is no town on which I could not give a brief lecture, covering its beauty, interests and history and the reasons someone might want to live there.

We need to change that attitude in our utterly Dublin-centric society. I am glad the Government has challenged us by bringing forward the plans for decentralisation. Unfortunately, I cannot congratulate the Government on a plan which cannot be implemented within the proposed three year period and therefore I cannot support the motion.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	337	It was a matter of congratulation.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The words of Senator O'Toole, as the former president of ICTU, will carry some weight. The question of implementation is something to which we will have to return.When this year's budget was introduced, the one issue that captured people's imagination was decentralisation. This must be admitted by people all over the political spectrum. The very criticism that has been continuously levelled at this Government, particularly our leader — that of indecisiveness — has been turned on its head. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that more than 130 submissions had been received. It must have been an extremely difficult job, if not impossible, for any Minister for Finance or member of the Government to decide where the various Departments would go. It would also have proven a challenge for those on the other side of the House if they had been in Government. I do not like to sound as though I am repeating everything Senator O'Toole said, but whatever the criticisms that may be levelled about implementation or the electoral advantages that may accrue from this, it is churlish to suggest that the decisions taken about where the Departments should go were questionable. That is a contemptible position to take and it shows a certain amount of typical Irish begrudgery and envy — that idea that one town has something while another does not.I welcome the developments. A total of 275 jobs are coming to Carrick-on-Shannon. Jobs are also coming to Sligo, Roscommon and Cavan, all of which are within 30 miles of where I live. The economic and social impact of those jobs on my town of Drumshanbo in County Leitrim will be immense. That is the matter about which I am concerned in the implementation process. I like where I live because of where it is. I do not wish to live in Dublin, Cork, Galway or any of the burgeoning cities around the country. I do not have anything against these cities — I love visiting them. Like most Senators, I spend half my working week in Dublin. I enjoy Dublin — I like its cultural life and its buzz. However, I like where I am living because it has certain unique qualities. I hope that uniqueness will not be lost because of decentralisation and that the Government will take account of the social and economic impact of transferring significant numbers of people out of their natural environment, in most cases, to these towns and cities. The infrastructure of these places should be supportive so that the transfer of people will not destroy the quality of life we have all enjoyed and continue to enjoy.I wanted to make that point because I know that people will welcome and embrace the concept of decentralisation, especially in a county such as my own which has suffered from the ravages of emigration, as has most of the west and the midlands. They will welcome the injection of jobs and cultural diversity. We will embrace the people who are coming to live among us. The Government has a responsibility to ensure this is a smooth transition that will not seriously disrupt the social fabric of the Ireland I know and love.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government on the wonderful initiative we know as decentralisation. I was born and reared in what is now a gateway town and I am now fortunate enough to live in another gateway town. I know at first hand the immeasurable impact decentralisation has on a town such as Sligo. We have the pensions section of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, which has provided more than 700 jobs. Nobody can know what this has meant to Sligo and its environs. It has made the town. The vibrancy in the town and county goes beyond anything we expected.Other speakers asked why everything should be kept on the east coast. Of course Departments should be decentralised. There was a constant stream of begrudgery from the Opposition. The only problem Fine Gael and the Labour Party have is that the idea was not theirs. When those parties were in power all those years ago, they did not introduce any programme such as this. One Senator claimed that no power was being given in this programme. However, the most important way of giving power is through jobs. Relocating 100 jobs to Sligo town will mean an extra 250 people living there. I could go on all night as to what that will do for services, sporting clubs and schools in the town as it is a good news story.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I welcome decentralisation in principle and it is an excellent idea. The Minister of State referred to Nenagh. I am the first to acknowledge that the decentralisation of some sections of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Food there has done nothing but good for the town. I look forward to the further decentralisation of different Departments to both Roscrea and Thurles. Decentralisation has a major impact on rural towns.However, there are concerns about this particular programme, especially the failure to line it up with the spatial strategy and how it will work in practice. There is also concern about how the Departments are moved out of Dublin and how the policy sections of the Departments can work. With Departments 100 miles from Dublin, how will the need for Ministers to have civil servants around when the Dáil is sitting be reconciled? Will there be a massive bill for civil servants' travel expenses? In the weeks after the programme was announced, I was informed by a PO from a particular Department that none of the POs was interested in moving. This will result in the extraordinary situation where they will be left in Dublin and a number of such posts will be created in the Department's new location. Will there be duplication? How will the promotion process work? If the decentralisation programme works, I hope there will be a career path within a county, for example in the Department of Defence in County Tipperary.

How will this work in practice because I am not sure it has been thought through? It reflects the highly politicised nature of the programme. It certainly looks likes jobs for the boys and girls, when viewed in the context of the abolition of the Local Appointments Commission. If 200 jobs are made available in Thurles, for example, and the appointments are to be made by the Minister, the obvious public concern is that it will be highly political.Nobody will have a problem with the principle of decentralisation. However, its operation, the reasons behind it and the manner in which it will work cause concern.

Maybe he should stay away from scripted speeches because, when he does, he offers more colour to the debate.I want to be equally parochial out of the sheer jealousy of County Cavan getting the headquarters of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I wish to be constructive in my contribution. Letterkenny is a gateway town, setting itself up as a centre of excellence — departmental officials should take note — in IT. Three years ago, the Taoiseach said that of all the local authorities, Donegal County Council is the front runner for IT development, which is the result of the ERNACT committee and the cross-Border link between Derry and Letterkenny. Derry has already been highlighted in our gateway status.

The point was made that we were not paying enough attention to regional distribution. We have done much more on that point. I looked at the figures for the rainbow coalition when it was in Government. Almost all the industrial investment between 1995 and 1997 went to the greater Dublin area. That was a real problem. At least with the setting up of the BMW region that has been somewhat redressed. Decentralisation is one of the best ways to continue this development. It is complementary to, and consistent with, the national spatial strategy. It is one of the best means of achieving balance. In all the towns chosen for decentralisation there is a great deal stirring in the undergrowth. People are inquiring about houses and there is an upsurge. A point was made about the project not being costed. The sites must be chosen and the cost of sites and buildings must be negotiated. How can one possibly put an accurate cost on that aspect? In the late 1980s decentralisation was adopted——

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	398	Before the adjournment of this debate, I was talking about the differentiation between married and unmarried parents and the situation in which the father is not registered. However, he can be registered if there is an agreement between the mother and the father and there is a statutory declaration in the presence of a commissioner of oaths. That is an advance on the previous situation. However, the problem is that this is not recorded as yet. There is no requirement for it to be recorded in any central register. That means there is an obligation on the parents to retain that, which they should do as good caring citizens, but that does not always happen and it can be mislaid, which could create a problem. It would mean they could be in significant trouble.There is a provision for re-registration of a birth if, for example, the parents subsequently marry or paternity is acknowledged by the mother. That is perfectly right. However, it should be automatic. The appointment of unmarried fathers as guardians is an equally important life event, given the range of rights and duties it encompasses, including the religious, moral, intellectual and social upbringing of the child. It should be placed on an equal basis and it should not be discriminatory.At present there is considerable confusion about guardianship and the question of recording the father's name on the register. Many people incorrectly believe that putting the father's name on the register automatically makes him a guardian of the children. As the Minister knows this is not so at present. It would be a great help and clear up considerable confusion if the entry of the father's particulars on the register automatically conferred a possible further right of guardianship at a later stage. While this could require an amendment to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, my advice is it could also be done within the scope of the Bill and the Minister should consider doing so.In the light of the fact that in holy Catholic Ireland one third of children are now born outside marriage, we are dealing with a very large number of citizens. Many fathers depend on these agreements to acquire the guardianship of the children. If there is a dispute the only record is this document and there should be a method of establishing how it was made. In other words there exists a two-tier discriminatory system as between married parents and, in particular, the biological father of the child in cases where the parents are unmarried, which is wrong. For example, children born to married parents can be registered in hospital immediately. However, unmarried parents are required to go to the register's office, which is discriminatory.Search engines, indexes, and children born outside marriage in the mother's name or in the chosen surname of the child only make it difficult for the father to trace using his name. Although the Bill is a further improvement and marks an advance, it is still discriminatory in certain areas and I ask the Minister to take these matters into account and see if the changes I have suggested could be incorporated into the Bill.As I said at the beginning of my contribution, a number of organisations have briefed many Senators and I understand that Fine Gael has been charged with tabling the amendments. It would be futile for me to table them. As was pointed out, we do not have a member on the relevant committee and it is appropriate for the Senator involved to table them. We will certainly support the amendments and I ask the Minister to look kindly upon them.
#DiarmuidWilson	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-party	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-dob	unknown-#DiarmuidWilson-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, and the officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the House. I am very pleased to speak here on the Civil Registration Bill 2003, which is the first major reform of civil registration legislation since it was first introduced in Ireland in 1845. This is a comprehensive Bill, which provides for the reorganisation and modernisation of the registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths.I support this important legislation as the existing structures and procedures are cumbersome and almost outdated. The provisions brought before us are well thought out and reflect the changing nature of life in 21st century. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and her Department deserve great praise for introducing this legislation, which in business terms will make all civil registrations more customer friendly, which is something all State agencies should attempt to do.Issues of civil registration touch each of us, our families and friends. It is easy to assume that civil registration only affects us at birth, when someone else did the registration for us, and then at death, when once again, someone else will look after the details on our behalf. However, in the years between birth and death, many aspects of civil registration impact on us. These include the documentation for marriage, enrolling children at school, commencing work and getting passports.The basic registration procedures have remained static over the years, despite the rapid advancements in technology that we use to our advantage in many other areas of life. We need to embrace these technological advances and utilise them to benefit all our citizens. I am sure substantial benefits will arise from the modernisation programme the Minister has brought before us in this Civil Registration Bill 2003. I wholeheartedly welcome the steps towards the introduction of modern technology to provide for on-line registration, electronic certificate production, and the eventual capturing and storing in electronic format of all paper-based records since 1845.All of us have at times cursed the huge amount of paper work and repetition required to perform certain tasks. I welcome wholeheartedly any change that will see an improvement in service, greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduction in red tape. Until now, the registration and certificate production processes were manual, time consuming and location dependent. I know people who had to travel on numerous occasions all over the country just to get copies of original certificates. This long-term plan will reduce the demand for paper certificates for the purposes of Government services, which I welcome.Since September 2003, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has implemented a new child benefit system. This is possible due to the fact that all new birth registration data is transferred electronically from the civil registration computer system. As the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, said in her speech earlier, this is a prime example of the e-Government objective of Departments working together to provide more convenient access to services for citizens. The introduction of the new civil registration system as outlined in this Bill, is therefore a flagship initiative in providing life-centred services to customers.The Bill will provide for the faster production of birth, death and marriage certificates and will also streamline the registration of adoptions. The provisions will end lengthy queues for birth and marriage certificates. I wish the Minister and her Department well with their plans to create a truly customer friendly service throughout the Department.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, to the House and agree with the broad sentiments expressed on both sides. Some of the legislation in this area dates back to 1844. It creates problems for parliamentary draftspersons to attempt to deal effectively with legislation that has been hanging around since 1844. It would be worth considering appointing more personnel to deal specifically with amending legislation to bring it up to modern day standards. The Second Schedule contains a long list of Acts to be repealed. We should consider modernising other legislation also.The Labour Party believes the Bill is an attempt to modernise the recording of events as one goes through life from birth to death, recognising the events that were not previously pertinent such as annulments and divorces. Statistics are important in the recording of events and information that can be used by Departments to project what may happen in the future. Part of the Bill is to suit bureaucracy and administration as opposed to recognising the rights of people involved. It is important to also recognise the right of guardianship. Senators on all sides were lobbied by the AMEN organisation. Senator Cummins read most of its submission into the record of the House, with which I concur. While there is a genuine attempt to address the issues in this regard, it could go a step further.It is important to recognise the registration of guardianship. Rights for everyone including young children deserve to be recognised. The Bill brings us from 1844 to the present day which is a huge improvement. The primitive nature of some legislation creates unnecessary difficulties when attempts are made to introduce good legislation in a wide range of areas. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, has pioneered the simplification of language terms within her Department, a policy which should be examined across a spectrum of Departments not only for documents available to the public, but also in the wording of legislation. It should become more reader friendly and more understandable and much of the old archaic expressions should be removed. This should be done to make the services of Departments and legislation in the Oireachtas more reader friendly. Much of the language is antiquated and if it were abolished, it would contribute to more effective legislation.The longer period to effect registration of various events is significant and welcome. The five day period is like the three month notice under the 1995 Act, whereby one may apply to a judge and the hearing takes place in camera. I am sure there will be some system whereby one can apply to the appropriate registrar because of particular extenuating circumstances. For example, the fact that it might not be possible to postpone a wedding may represent an extenuating circumstance. It would be undesirable if the legislation did not vest in the registrar power to have discretion in such situations.The system of registration of births, marriages and deaths in Ireland dates back to the early 1800s, as is outlined in the Second Schedule to the Bill. The system has evolved naturally over the years. The Labour Party in Government played its part in reforming this area with the Still Births Registration Act 1994, which provided for the first time a statutory system for the registration of births of stillborn children. This is a sensitive issue and one which is upsetting for people who go through the process of losing loved ones, but the system needs to be examined in a fresh context. People do not think clearly on days on which they have to cope with tragic and unfortunate circumstances and the Act has been comforting for parents of stillborn children. Former Minister Mervyn Taylor piloted that legislation and it is fitting that he is now a member of the commission on human rights.Another innovative measure introduced by former Minister Taylor was the Registration of Births Act 1996, which for the first time provided a new form of birth certificate which treated mothers and fathers equally. Prior to this, the registration of birth system requested information regarding the father's occupation but not the mother's, which was a huge inequity. This is one of the great achievements of recent years. Everyone can talk about economic progress but that may cloud the progress made on equality legislation, no matter by whom it was introduced. This legislation has examined and confronted societal problems and created opportunities through which people could move forward.It is almost ten years since the divorce referendum was successfully passed. At that stage there were many opposing views and if new Ireland demonstrates one thing, it is the broad-thinking, reasonable-minded attitude of the vast majority of citizens to deal with problems as they arise. The archaic laws and their application to marital breakdown were a huge problem at the time. The State did not recognise the right of many people to remarry. The introduction of legislation created an opportunity for people to remarry within a legal framework and was one of the more progressive pieces of legislation of the early to mid-1990s. It characterised the distance Ireland has come in terms of the social agenda and social change and speaks volumes about the politicians of the day who successfully tackled the issue.The Bill has the broad support of the Labour Party but it is not perfect legislation and I look forward to Committee Stage, during which we can table amendments. I hope the Minister will look favourably on them because they will be tabled to improve not just the text, but the effect of the Bill. It is a huge improvement and a step in the right direction. However, we could have taken it an extra length — it has not gone the full nine yards. Nonetheless, I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill and I appeal to her to look favourably upon Opposition amendments to improve it on Committee Stage.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I am pleased to welcome the Civil Registration Bill 2003 to the Seanad. The Bill provides a new legislative framework for civil registration, supports and enables the modernisation of the civil registration service and facilitates the decentralisation of the General Register Office to Roscommon. This topic is not as emotive and is not getting Senators as excited as the debate on decentralisation did earlier. However, we are here to legislate and, although it may not be exciting legislation, it is fundamentally important to the country and the modernisation of the process of civil registration.The work being carried out jointly between the Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs is a tremendous compliment to both Departments. The public servants are driving forward this technology to give greater customer satisfaction in this regard. This major undertaking will see the introduction of modern technology to civil registration and the reform of legislation. It is interesting for the young people in the Visitors Gallery that, until now, the registration and certification production processes were manual, time-consuming and location dependent.The re-design of the child benefit system is the first manifestation of the modernisation of the new service delivery framework. Since September 2003, all new birth registration data is transferred electronically to the Department of Social and Family Affairs from the civil registration computer system. This facilitates the allocation of a personal public service number to a child at registration. It establishes a child's public service identity and the creation of family links on the national central database for all citizens and the initiation of a child benefit claim for first born children and automatic payment for second and subsequent children in a family. In other words, a single interaction with the public service agency, for example, the registration of a birth, not only serves its original purpose, but also triggers a series of related services by another agency — in this case, the Department of Social and Family Affairs.Part 3 provides for the registration of births and stillbirths. The principal responsibility for registering a birth will remain with the parents, who will be required to register the event within three months of the birth. To facilitate parents in fulfilling this obligation, the current time limit of a meagre 42 days will be extended to three months. In future, births may be registered with any registrar, as opposed to the current system in which the birth can only be registered by the registrar of the district in which the birth occurred. It is not location bound.One third of births in Ireland are non-marital. When a baby is born to an unmarried mother and the father's name is not registered, up to now, that position was carved in stone and no change could be made to it. However, if there is a change in the circumstances of the relationship the father's name can be added to the certificate. This is fundamentally important and gives a much more equal opportunity to the child of the single parent than the married parent.The registration system triggers systems in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, thus activating the child benefit system. I compliment the two Departments on the modernisation and computerisation of the birth registration system.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Senator McCarthy made a very important point regarding the legislation. Members know the legislation dates back to the 1840s and Senator McCarthy said it was difficult for Parliamentary Counsel to make sense of it and it is very difficult for Senators and Deputies to make head or tail of it, given that to read this Bill one has to have in one's possession all the other Acts relevant to it. This emphasises the need for a consolidated Bill. However, I welcome this Bill as previous changes to the civil registration code have been made as an add on to social welfare Bills — I know this from my time as spokesperson in the Dáil — which was completely unacceptable.This is a very important Bill. We need to take time to go through it as best we can on the basis that we are setting a standard for the next ten to 15 years and must get it right. There must be quite a pause between Second, Committee and Report Stages, and I encourage the Government to allow for that.I will not repeat all the points made on the issue of unmarried fathers. It is important to note that substantial changes have occurred in the past 20 years or so. Before the Status of Children Act 1987 an unmarried father could not obtain guardianship of his child, however that Act ensured that with a court order an unmarried father could gain guardianship. Since that there have been further developments in the Children's Act 1997, and a father and a mother can, on agreement, without going to court obtain that. That has been an important development. I agree with Senators Norris, McCarthy, White and others that we have to go further. This Bill gives us the opportunity to give unmarried fathers automatic rights of guardianship which can then be tested. The way to do that is at the initial stage when compiling the information for the birth certificate. The Bill provides an opportunity to make those types of reform. The AMEN group has made a detailed submission on this matter to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, and to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I ask them to consider it, given the high percentage of births to unmarried men and women — a third of all births are outside wedlock. We have to recognise that, and recognise the rights of fathers, who have been completely ignored up until the last 15 years. I still think we have a great deal more to do in this area.On that issue, I find it quite strange that the only person who can apply for the child benefit payment is the mother. I know this from personal experience in recent months and one of the reasons I am so fond of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is the substantial largesse in child benefit before the last election, which benefited me in particular. In this day and age it is quite sexist that very strict guidelines to make application for child benefit should only apply to women and not men. It is ludicrous that a delay of a number of months occurs before the child benefit payment is made. If a child is born on 1 February in the Coombe Hospital in Dublin, by the following month, his or her parents should be able to obtain child benefit. We need reform in this area. There are inbuilt systems failures which do not work in favour of men, in particular young unmarried men. This Bill gives us an opportunity of going through these in greater detail.I welcome the provisions in sections 28 to 30 on stillbirths, in particular section 28 which extends the period of application from 42 days at present to 12 months, whereby the parents of a stillborn baby can make an application to have the birth registered. As Senator McCarthy said it was the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor, who initially introduced this measure and Deputy Coughlan is extending the registration period to 12 months. This very welcome measure is very sensitive and right, particularly when a first child is stillborn. This is a very traumatic experience for the parents and it is happening more frequently because of the age when people have children. Could we retrospectively change that provision, in other words would it be possible from 1994 onwards to extend the registration period to 12 months, as proposed in the Bill? Many parents, including myself, were not aware that a stillbirth could be registered and it would greatly help the grieving process that follows the tragedy of a stillborn baby if the couple could register it. Will the Minister look at that provision between now and Committee Stage and consider whether it would be possible to retrospectively apply the 12 months from 1994? I am not sure if that is possible, and the Parliamentary Counsel may say it is not possible because of the laws on retrospection. However, I think it would be worthwhile.I had personal experience some years ago when I had to register the death of a parent. The sensitivity shown to people who have to register a death is exceptional. The person is brought into a private room to fill out the form, where there is no one else looking on. It is a traumatic experience having to register the death of a loved one. I congratulate the offices in the city centre that deal with the registration of deaths. I wonder if it is the same in every county. Are there guidelines in every county so that people are seen on a one to one basis?It was brought to my attention recently that one of the ways that passports can be sold outside this country is through a failure to correlate information on people who have died with the registration of birth and the provision of a birth certificate. I heard of an instance of a criminal element which managed to go into a graveyard and find out the name of a person who had died in her early 20s, then applied for a birth certificate, having found out her address. With a birth certificate they are entitled to get a passport which can then be sold on through another criminal organisation. The new system of a PPS number goes a long way in deterring this type of activity.Is there a formal procedure through the new tracking system whereby, if someone dies and his or her death certificate is issued, no other birth certificate can automatically be handed out? Has this matter been brought to the attention of other Members? On two separate occasions it has been brought to my attention that, for criminal purposes, birth certificates were issued for people who are deceased. We must also ensure that someone who has entered the State illegally cannot be issued unwittingly with a passport. The Minister should examine that matter.Fine Gael supports the Bill, which has been a long time in the offing. I hope we can work with the Minister to improve it on Committee Stage, thereby putting civil registration law on a solid footing for the next 20 years.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I welcome the Bill, which is important and enlightened legislation. In the future it will certainly help ordinary citizens who will no longer have to seek out, for certain bureaucratic purposes, birth certificates that have been hidden in drawers or other places. It is a big advance that child benefit will follow automatically on the registration of births.Senator Brian Hayes asked whether child benefit should be payable to the mother. That measure was adopted about 20 years ago as a piece of positive discrimination. It was a social reform because child benefit was not always going where it was most needed. I am not sure whether social conditions have changed sufficiently for that to be no longer necessary, but I would hesitate to change the system too hurriedly.The importance of registration for tracing family roots has not been referred to a great deal during the debate, but much of the work of the General Register Office is concerned with genealogy. Genealogists have suggested that a death certificate should include the names of the deceased's parents. If someone called John Ryan dies in a place where there are perhaps a dozen other John Ryans, such details would help to identify the particular person concerned. Such a provision should be examined from a genealogical angle.In her speech, the Minister referred to the formal introduction of registration but informal methods of registration date back to the mid-17th century. I have had occasion to look through the registers in the Bolton Library in Cashel, some of which date back to the 1650s. In 1779, Archbishop Agar, of whom a lengthy biography was launched by the Taoiseach last year, introduced a system for registering births, marriages and deaths in the Church of Ireland community. Complete registers for the various parishes exist from that period, following which the registration system was gradually adopted elsewhere. Such records are very helpful in carrying out genealogical research.I compliment the Minister and her Department on sorting out a potential problem concerning the explicit requirement for people to state there are no impediments to a marriage taking place. In the Church of Ireland that position was indicated by silence, whereas the legislation seeks a formal affirmation. There was particular concern because a prayer book is currently being printed and, naturally enough, people did not want to have to change it at great expense and bin the old copies. I compliment the Minister and her Department on having solved that problem. Looking through the legislation, I see that certain practical dispositions have had to be taken regarding other denominations in order to satisfy the law.Although many of us attend weddings, it is relatively rare that we act as principal witnesses on such occasions. My daughter got married last year and my clear impression was that when a married couple go off on honeymoon, the officiating clergyman takes charge of returning the registration form, although I accept that marriages are not always solemnised by a clergyman. I note that the legislation places a responsibility for returning the registration form on the couple themselves but, de facto, it seems that the clergyman often undertakes this task.There is another problem, which is less pleasing to consider. People who live alone are often found dead some time after their demise but the legislation does not appear to refer to determining the date of death. There is a practice whereby the date of death that is entered on a register is quite often the date on which the deceased person was found. They may have passed away two or three days beforehand, however, and the legislation is not clear on how one is supposed to determine the date of death in such cases.I note an enlightened piece of modern legislation is contained in the First Schedule which statesThe surname of the child to be entered shall, subject to any linguistic modifications [I like that. It is very important in Irish circumstances] be—(a) that of the parents of the child as stated in the register of births or of either of them, as may be determined by the person who, pursuant to section 19, gives the required particulars of the birth concerned to the registrar . . .In other words, it means that, even where people are married, the child can take the name of its mother or father and, therefore, all the patronymic stuff does not necessarily have to follow any more.All children have a father, of course, and it is progress, as Senator White said, that it is now possible to have the father's name added to the certification. In principle, it is desirable that both parents' names be recorded and recognised as the parents. I accept this cannot be done coercively and that consent is required. It raised the thought in my mind that when a mother indicates a person as being the father of her child, and if she is not in contact with him, someone else should contact him to see whether he is willing to be so recognised. There is a principle that people should be encouraged to accept responsibility for bringing a child into the world. Clearly, it is not just the mother who brings the child into the world, so fathers have a responsibility in this regard.During the debate, a point was made about legal guardianship, which is an important issue but I am not sure that it is suitable for the Civil Registration Bill. It is probably something for inclusion in separate legislation, while being cross-referenced to this Bill.I was an adviser to the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, when he decided to decentralise the General Register Office to Roscommon. To say that it was greeted with universal enthusiasm might be a slight exaggeration, even in comparison to the criteria we were applying to the debate earlier this evening. Even though wheels sometimes move slowly, they do eventually turn and I am glad that it is eventually, if tardily, coming to fruition.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I thank the Taoiseach, the Minister and others, including Senator Mansergh, for intervening on an issue which the Senator raised a few minutes ago. It was an issue which greatly troubled the Church of Ireland and on which several of us were lobbied and asked to make representations, which we did.I refer to the Church of Ireland rule whereby people need not make the most positive affirmation that there is a reason they should not be married. This Bill, if it is not amended, might conflict with that, and the Church of Ireland might end up having to jettison its own liturgy in some way. It found itself in a great deal of difficulty as a result of this Bill. I am not certain that the problem has been finally resolved by what we have heard already, but I am told that much has been going on behind the scenes and that the Government is looking very sympathetically on this case. That should be recognised at this stage. Perhaps the Minister might address that again in her summing up. The Church of Ireland ceremony dates from the 12th century, and it has not been found particularly faulty. It would be difficult not just for liturgical reasons but for those that Senator Mansergh——

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	406	——has already mentioned. The issue is money. The Church of Ireland has only just issued a new prayer book, and it would be extremely inconvenient, to say the very least, to have to reprint it. There is an issue of conflict between church and State law here, albeit a small church, and what must be done in a marriage for it to be affirmed. I ask the Minister to look at this very sympathetically, particularly on Committee Stage, and we will come back to it then.

Beidh díospóireacht níos faide againn ar Chéim an Choiste, agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh níos mó le rá ag na Seanadóirí ansin.Many might have felt that this legislation was simple, but it impinges on everyone in this country. Without a doubt, the Lower House indicated to me quite vociferously that, despite the fact that we have had serious consultation with many bodies and parties, it is necessary to examine fully any legislation going through either House, since we have been able to improve it on several occasions and had something of a pre-emptive strike against some of the Senators regarding several of the issues raised in the House. I think that I have ten minutes.

I will go over one or two points in particular, perhaps giving answers, before returning to the policy issues. There was a question from the genealogists regarding the death certificate and having information on the place and date of birth. I have agreed to this being included in the legislation, so that should assuage their concerns.Senator Mansergh spoke about the fact that the clergyman or woman would normally facilitate the registration. We are not saying that cannot happen, but it is the responsibility of the married couple to ensure it does happen. They can still allow the clergyman or woman to forward that registration form. Several issues arose surrounding people going away on their honeymoons and forgetting to send in their registration forms. Once they say "I do", they are married. Thereafter they have a certain period to register, after which a reminder is issued. In the heat of the moment, people forget about some of the practicalities involved in getting married, and an automatic reminder goes out to the couple to come to the registrar and send in their form. That is very important as undoubtedly we are reflecting not only the modernisation of a system but a modern society. We also appreciate that people often forget, and have not been given enough time to participate in many important life events, so we have facilitated that by the extension of the time within which people can register. In the main, there has been a fair amount of support for this legislation, and I very much welcome that. There are several issues of particular concern to a number of people, and we will be taking them into consideration.One issue particular to the Church of Ireland has been raised. It came to our notice very recently following the Committee Stage of the legislation. I thank Senator Mansergh and my officials in the Department, who were more than forthcoming in supporting the issues and concerns raised by the Church of Ireland. It is now intended that the new ceremony include the substantive requirements for a valid marriage but accommodate the liturgical requirements of the different religious denominations. The marriage registration form must be completed by all parties to the marriage immediately after the ceremony. We will be addressing the liturgical issues.Following consultations with the Church of Ireland on the matter, it has been proposed that the form of ceremony to be approved by an tArd-Chláraitheoir will include a declaration before witnesses before the commencement of the liturgy. That meets the needs of the churches, and legal advice has been taken to ensure that it also meets the requirement of section 51(3) of the Bill as drafted. I believe that we will be able to give a conclusive answer to the Church of Ireland very quickly. I thank it most sincerely, not only for bringing it to our attention but equally for facilitating the agreement that will move forward the issues brought to my attention.We may have a greater opportunity to discuss the registration of a father's particulars on Committee Stage. Many Members have raised that matter. Several of the concerns raised have touched on the practicalities of life, and I certainly agree with them. The provisions in the Bill allow for registration with an extended period of three months. That may in some way address some of the pressurised concerns expressed by Members. Furthermore, there are facilities for registration immediately after the birth of the child in the major hospitals. This is progressive and will certainly facilitate parents. The emphasis of sections 22 and 23 of the legislation is to facilitate and encourage fathers to register. That is what we would like to see happening.We also provide within the legislative framework of the Bill for application to be made by either parent acting alone and supported by a court order to name the father in the Register of Births. However, I advise Senators of a matter of which I had to educate myself before this legislation. There is no presumption in law that a man other than the husband of a married woman is the father of her child. There would be practical and legal difficulties for a registrar in requiring a man to register the birth of a child without paternity being conclusively established. That said, Members will see that we speak of a "person" in the legislation and then of the "father". Perhaps I am pre-empting an amendment from the Opposition. It indicates that one is a person until such time as it has been determined that one is the father. That creates difficulties in itself.However, I know from the statistics made available by an tArd-Chláraitheoir that we have a high percentage of fathers participating in the registration initially. Moreover, we have quite a number of applications — I believe 1,500 — to reregister births, indicating that there has been a discussion within the family and a decision made to have the name on the register. We would all like to encourage people to register, but it is also very important that we do not institute any compulsion. There are issues — I am sure every Member has encountered them in his or her constituency — where there are serious difficulties pertaining to people putting a name on the register and consequential distressing emotional difficulties. Therefore, in appreciating the importance of the registration of a child and the complexities attached to people's relationships, the aim under section 22 is to facilitate, as much as possible, the registration by the father.Another issue raised by a number of Members was the mother's marital status on the birth certificate. Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Bill sets out the required particulars to be entered in the register of birth. The civil registration service is required under the Vital Statistics Act 1952 to collect the marital status of the child's mother when registering a birth. It is also used to determine if the presumption of paternity of the husband applies and also determines whether section 22 of the Bill applies, that is, where parents are not married. The marital status does not appear on the birth certificate and it is used for statistical purposes as are many other pieces of information which are garnered but not used on the certificate. In the interests of equality, I have included the marital status of the man in the Schedule following debate in the other House.Reference was made during the debate to the re-registering of a birth following the marriage of the parents. I accepted an amendment to facilitate this and it will resolve the issue of the child's surname. In cases of remarriage of a widow, the birth entry of any child of the new marriage will include any former surname or surnames of the parent or parents to facilitate those particular and pertinent situations.On the registration of guardianship, I am glad Members appreciate it is not, in itself, a life event and that its role within registration would be dubious. It was raised on a number of occasions on Second and Committee Stages in the other House. The Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides for a declaration by the mother and father in regard to the guardianship of the child. Such declarations may be made before a peace commissioner, a commissioner for oaths or a notary public. The 1964 Act made no provision for the registration of such declarations and the schedule to the statutory declaration contains a warning that a declaration is an important document and should be kept in a safe place. A father may also be appointed as a guardian by order of the court. The tArd-Chláraitheoir has no function in the registration of guardianship orders granted by the courts or in regard to the registration of statutory declarations of guardianship nor would it be appropriate that he or she would have that function.However, following the debate in the other House, I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring to his attention the issues raised by Members concerning guardianship within the legislation. As Members know, an interdepartmental committee is looking at the issue of marriage. Equated to that, many issues may arise which would have legislative impacts. Arising from the debates which have taken place, I have advised the Minister of the views of Members of the other House which were emulated in this House.Questions were asked about the number of life events registered in 2002. For the information of Members, I will briefly outline the level of activity in regard to life event registration which takes place annually. Some 60,000 births, 400 stillbirths, 250 Irish adoptions, 336 foreign adoptions, 20,000 marriages and 30,000 deaths were registered. There were 1,500 re-registrations of births, 1,500 late registrations and 4,000 amendments. Some 500,000 certificates were produced and there were 1.2 million searches. A considerable amount of work was carried out in 2002.I compliment the tArd-Chláraitheoir and the staff who have moved to Roscommon. I believe there are only 15 staff members left to go to Roscommon. They have decentralised despite the legislation and they have done tremendous work to ensure all those records are made available electronically. Without a doubt, this legislation is proactive and modern and it emulates many of the concerns expressed by Members. It will bring a better public service to many.On the registration of deaths, I said we would facilitate the place of birth. An issue was raised by Senator Mansergh in regard to the date of death and often the place of death in particular circumstances.

I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming to the House to reply.I thank the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government for delivering a long overdue state-of-the-art sewerage scheme to Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, of which I am a native. For years, the local river, the Claredalgan, which is a feeder of the River Corrib, was badly polluted and one of the main culprits was the local authority, as is often the case in such circumstances. The policeman in this case was the main offender. Unfortunately, the other main offender for a period was a local meat factory, which now has its operation in order.We now have a new sewerage scheme in the process of completion — I thank the previous Minister and the Government for approving the necessary finance for it — to which I seek a modest extension. With the contractors on site, the necessary work could be done more expeditiously and economically than in the future. Essentially, I am seeking an extension to what is known as the Knock Road.Development in Ballyhaunis is considerably constrained by virtue of the fact that the town is located on the intersection of two national roads and, as everybody is aware, one cannot easily obtain planning permission for one-off houses on national primary or secondary roads. The development of the town has been significantly constrained as a result.The road in question is a regional road linking Ballyhaunis and Knock. It has had a high density of building in recent years but each of the houses in question is serviced by a septic tank. In this day and age, this is not the ideal solution and, as a result, those wishing to build on the road are encountering considerable restrictions. As I stated, it is one of few roads in Ballyhaunis which could be developed without encountering difficulties with regard to one-off housing.In addition, a number of small roads which lead off the road in question would be ideal locations for clusters of houses. The area is a prime location for development but because of the difficulties with regard to sewerage facilities and the proliferation of septic tanks, all development on the road, and consequently the town, will stop.The current position is that Mayo County Council has completed a design for the scheme, negotiated with the contractor, and has received an attractive tender price. The matter is now with the Department but, unfortunately, particularly given that the contractors are about to terminate phase one of the project, the scheme has not received the necessary approval.Ballyhaunis is ideally located in the centre of Connacht, some 40 miles from Sligo, Galway, Carrick-on-Shannon, Westport and Athlone. I plead with the Minister of State for a satisfactory response to the case I have made.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I thank Senator Higgins for raising this issue which arises in the context of the major investment being made by the Department in improving water services infrastructure throughout the country under the national development plan. As the Senator admitted, Ballyhaunis is among the many locations to have benefited from this investment.Last August, the water services investment programme, 2003-2005, was published consisting of more than 700 schemes at different stages of development. With a total investment value of more than €5 billion, it is the most significant milestone yet in the push to bring our water services infrastructure up to a world standard.The total allocated to County Mayo under the latest phase of water services programme amounts to slightly more than €300 million, extending to some 40 individual schemes. The programme includes major sewerage projects for Knock, Castlebar, Ballina, Kiltimagh, Killala, Achill Sound, Belmullet and Foxford. It also contains large water supply improvements for Ballyhaunis, Balla, Achill, Ballina, Crossmolina, Glenamoy, Kilmaine, Shrule, Westport and Louisburgh and new waste water treatment schemes have recently been completed in Westport and Crossmolina. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a number of key locations around the county.It is clear, therefore, that a large number of towns and villages in County Mayo are directly benefiting from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard. Ballyhaunis, in particular, is a prime example. The town now has a fully up-to-date waste water system, including a new treatment plant and refurbished waste water collection network, completed at a cost of more than €7 million.The Department's current water services programme includes two further schemes to improve water supply in the town. The first of these is a €30 million extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Knock and Ballyhaunis. The Ballyhaunis town water scheme, costing more than €11 million, includes a new reservoir for the town and a comprehensive upgrade of the water distribution system. Both schemes are expected to be in operation in the near future. Combined with the new sewerage scheme, these projects will greatly enhance Ballyhaunis's ability to compete for and deal with development opportunities.Last year, my Department received an application from Mayo County Council for funding under the water services programme for a sewer extension on the Knock Road at Derrymore. This is the proposal to which the Senator refers and would involve constructing the sewer extension in conjunction with a pipe laying contract under the Ballyhaunis town water scheme to provide sewerage services to a number of houses currently using septic tanks. The application was given careful examination in the Department following receipt of all necessary details from the council. Unfortunately, it transpired that the unit cost of servicing existing and planned houses in the area concerned could not be regarded as an economic or sustainable solution in the context of overall national investment priorities under the water services programme.Mayo County Council was informed of the position by the Department last October. The Department also pointed out to the council at the time that it was open to it to consider funding the proposal from its own resources, with or without contributions from the individual householders, or under the serviced land initiative if it believed the sewer extension could be used to service potential future development along the proposed pipeline route.In the case of the serviced land initiative, 40% of the funding would be available from the Department, with the balance of the cost having to be met by prospective developers. Another option would be for the council to finance the proposal from its annual block grant allocation from the Department under the small schemes programme, in which responsibility for determining local priorities is devolved to the local authorities.I understand a response to the Department's communication was received from Mayo County Council yesterday afternoon. Any new or additional information contained in the council's reply will be carefully considered by the Department and there will be no delay in conveying a decision back to it.The Senator stated a good tender price had been received for the scheme. The figure was more than €250,000, which would make unit costs per house approximately double the normal target figure. This is not, however, written in stone. I am aware that planning permission has been granted for a couple of other houses on the road in question. If these were included in the pot, it could reduce the unit price a little. The current position, however, is that the unit price is double the normal target level and this will cause a difficulty, unless it is possible to raise some of the required funding from some of the developers or potential other developments on the road in question.The Department will give early consideration to the communication it received yesterday from Mayo County Council and I expect a response will issue soon, possibly within three weeks.

I hope the Minister of State will react positively to it. While the time limit for applications under the urban renewal tax incentive scheme was extended from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2006, which is very welcome, I am puzzled as to the reason the Minister of State has not made provision for those towns which did not qualify under the original scheme to participate now. This time extension for the urban renewal scheme which is operating in 100 small towns will allow developers and local authorities the opportunity to extend the take-up under the scheme.The relief available afforded a unique opportunity to individuals and groups to undertake this development and will contribute to important objectives of population retention and growth in those selected towns. The scheme will also support industrial, commercial and rental residential development. It affords owner-occupiers of new or refurbished dwellings an opportunity to qualify for personal income tax relief on the cost of construction or renovation of such buildings.The urban renewal scheme provides tax incentives for certain towns outside the urban renewal scheme area with populations between 500 and 6,000 people. One hundred towns have qualified. The towns which have qualified to date are thriving and this is recognised by local authorities, developers and the public.In October 2002, the Minister of State admitted that the take-up of the scheme had been very slow, yet to date there are towns which have not qualified under the original scheme. It appears the scheme is under-subscribed. I ask the Minister of State to shed some light on this anomaly and clarify the reason these towns are being excluded. I have received many representations from chambers of commerce and other development associations in County Longford and in other counties on the western seaboard who feel they were hard done by last time. I ask the Minister of State to give some consideration to all villages and towns in the BMW region.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	425	Following the good results achieved under successive urban renewal schemes, which currently benefit the five cities and 38 large towns, the tax incentive-based town renewal scheme 2000 was aimed at the physical renewal of smaller towns, that is, those in the population range of 500 to 6,000 people. The scheme is intended to promote sustainable development patterns, counteract population movement from towns to the surrounding countryside, combat dereliction and revitalise designated towns as commercial and social centres.It was considered essential to utilise tax incentives in a judicious and balanced fashion to ensure that those towns with the greatest need and potential in each county were targeted. Accordingly, designations under the scheme were based on dedicated town renewal plans. County councils were asked to prepare these plans under comprehensive guidelines from my Department, to identify targeted sites for tax designation and to justify the proposed designations by reference to the plans objectives.In considering a candidate town, councils considered its attractiveness as a place to live, the scope for residential development in the town centre, its potential as a commercial and social centre, the adequacy of its infrastructure and its current heritage status. Following examination of town renewal plans by an independent expert panel, 100 towns were approved under the scheme. Generally, between three and seven locations were designated in each county, depending on county population.The most recent projections are that overall investment under the scheme will amount to approximately €350 million. In order to optimise take-up and achieve maximum benefits under the scheme, the Minister for Finance has decided to extend its termination date from the end of 2004 to 31 July 2006. That is the extension of the existing scheme and not the creation of a new one. It is not proposed to re-open the matter. For a number of reasons I do not consider that it would be especially practical or useful to seek now to extend the current scheme to encompass further towns.By any yardstick, the current scheme is a success and I consider this is largely attributable to the targeted and focused approach adopted. Access on too wide a basis would tend to dissipate available resources and defeat the purpose of attracting investment and settlement to designated town centres with the greatest potential. In any event, it would be wrong to assume that towns outside the current scheme do not benefit from tax relief and other support measures. Various support schemes are operated by a number of Departments. The rural renewal scheme plays a significant role in sustaining rural areas not benefiting from the urban-town renewal schemes.Under the aegis of my Department, the EU-Exchequer funded urban and village renewal programme continues to make good progress, with investment in some 135 urban and rural locations nationally during 2003. Total public investment under this programme will be almost €160 million. Funding is also available under the EU programme for peace and reconciliation towards community development measures in the Border counties.Overall, I am not convinced of the desirability or feasibility of designating additional towns under the town renewal scheme and there are no proposals to amend it. While an extension was given this year, that is supposed to be the end of it and these tax incentives will not be allowed by the EU from the end of 2006. There are other schemes which are benefiting other parts of the country. It is a requirement that the various tax incentive renewal schemes are mutually exclusive and any given area can only benefit under one scheme, whichever is most appropriate to that area.Longford town was already included in the 1999 urban renewal scheme. Most if not all of County Longford was included in the 1998 rural renewal scheme which is targeted at regenerating parts of the upper Shannon region. These schemes are targeted at different counties and if an area is benefiting under one, it cannot benefit under another. While an extension by up to two years has been given for work in progress or for projects that had been given planning permission, as of now that era is over because the EU has a problem with the continuation of those schemes. It is not intended to re-open it because that is a very long-winded process and it takes much time to get in projects. We are continuing with the scheme as it exists at present.

I recommend that users of such vehicles should observe good safety practice, but a small percentage of such people do not do so, unfortunately. There are great difficulties in many areas as a consequence. There are many lakes and rivers in my home county of Westmeath, which is known as "the lake county". A small proportion of people, who are not indigenous to the county, cause absolute mayhem in the area on a regular basis. They annoy swimmers and disrupt anglers during the angling season. They make a point of being particularly provocative in their actions when angling competitions are taking place.I want amending legislation to be brought forward. I spoke on this matter yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I have clearly stated my position to the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, whom I wish to thank for his courtesy in receiving deputations from Mullingar on two occasions. There has been a fatal accident in Cobh and I understand that accidents have also occurred elsewhere. An accident will happen on Lough Ennell in County Westmeath if something is not done very soon. Everybody is entitled to use the waterways, by all means, but regulations and legislation are needed to ensure that those who use jet skis and speedboats operate them in a way that takes cognisance of other waterway users. A specific section of any given lake should be designated for this sport because of its nature.Local authorities should be the enforcement agencies in this regard. There is no point in giving power to local authorities without also giving them resources. If there is to be enforcement, it can only come about if resources are provided. Every boat should be licensed so that it is identifiable. Any vehicle, in the air or on land, has to have a licence plate so that it can be identified. There is no way of identifying motorised water craft because they do not have licence plates.I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to convey to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, my concerns and those of other Members who have spoken about this matter ad nauseam in this House and elsewhere. They have the full support of this House in their attempts to bring forward amending legislation which will enable the appropriate regulations to be made. The regulations I demand will ensure that users of lakes and other waterways can enjoy themselves in safety.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	432	This is a very serious issue. I agree with my colleague, Senator Glynn, that proper regulation is required for jet skiing and water skiing on our inland waterways and at sea. I should declare an interest at the outset — I am an avid water ski enthusiast and I own a jet ski.The activities under discussion have resulted in fatalities and serious injuries throughout the country, for example in Senator Glynn's home county. There was a fatality in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, some years ago as a consequence of this activity. Many people like me would be more than happy to operate in line with clearly defined regulations and parameters, which need to be introduced. There are rogues in every area of activity, however, and this activity is no different so it needs to be properly legislated for and properly regulated. It does not matter if it is policed by the local authorities, or by the fisheries officers who operate in these areas.Genuine people who want to participate in angling, jet skiing or swimming should be given clearly defined and properly policed areas in which to do so. Not only would such measures represent a serious improvement in the context of health and safety, but they would also help us to market our inland waterways, lakes and coastal areas. This is a central aspect of tapping into a resource that has not yet been tapped into. We have under-utilised these resources to a significant degree in the past. Health and safety matters need to be top of the agenda. This area needs to be properly resourced, in the interests of anglers, swimmers and other groups. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, just as Senator Glynn has done. I am aware that legislation is due to come before the House and I look forward to discussing it. I hope the Bill that is brought forward will contain the appropriate measures needed to protect those who participate in the various activities on our waterways.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-11 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank Senators Glynn and MacSharry for their comments, which are based on their local and personal knowledge of these problems. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, regrets that he is unable to attend this debate this evening. He has asked me to emphasise that he will not tolerate the unsafe use of jet skis in waters off our coast and on our inland waterways. The operation of jet skis and other high powered leisure water craft in areas where bathing takes place, harbours and other places frequented by water users is a matter of particular concern. Since he took office, the Minister has implemented a number of measures to address this problem.Two sets of regulations which contain national provisions governing the safe use of jet skis and similar craft were introduced in 2001. The first set, the Merchant Shipping (Mechanically Propelled Pleasure Craft) (Safety) Regulations 2001, contains age restriction provisions, provides for the carrying, wearing and use of lifejackets and restricts the use of alcohol and drugs. The provisions also apply to ski boarding, water skiing, paragliding and other towed rides. The second set of regulations, the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 (Prescribed Classes of Vessels) Regulations, 2001, prescribe personal water craft or jet skis, and fast power craft for the purposes of careless and dangerous navigation or operation provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000.The penalties for dangerous navigation or operation offences are imprisonment for up to five years, a fine of up to €10,000, or both where death or serious bodily harm is caused. In all other cases, the regulations provide for a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months, a fine of up to €1,500, or both. The Minister has recently brought forward proposals to amend the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts to increase penalties for breaches of fishery harbour centre by-laws. The proposals will provide for stronger controls on jet skis and other high powered craft that could endanger life and seriously prejudice the proper operation of fishery harbours.The Minister wishes to encourage local authorities to adopt local by-laws for the safe operation of jet skis for all areas under their responsibility, including beaches. To this end, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been encouraging local authorities to adopt suitable by-laws. At least eight local authorities have implemented new by-laws on the use of jet skis and others are following suit. This has followed a campaign introduced by the Department for the safer use of jet skis.A legal issue has arisen regarding the making of the by-laws in respect of water areas not directly under the control of a local authority. Section 33(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992, inserted by section 44(11) of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, provides for the introduction of regulations to enable local authorities to make by-laws for the control of vessels, including personal water craft and fast power craft in areas under their jurisdiction. The Department's legal advice indicates that this provision might be open to challenge in light of recent case law. The Department's maritime safety directorate has consulted the Office of the Attorney General on the legal position and the powers of local authorities to make by-laws to regulate jet skis and other such craft. The most recent legal advice states that it appears that local authorities have the power to make by-laws under section 37(1) of the Local Government Act 1994, subject to the area being under the control or management of the relevant local authority. Local authorities, however, cannot make by-laws under section 37 for areas not under their control or management, unless section 33 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 is repealed or amended.The Minister has requested his officials to introduce proposals as quickly as possible for legislation to address these legal difficulties. This approach will help considerably to allay public concerns about the improper use of jet skis and other watercraft on all waterways within the State. As part of the review of safety measures on small watercraft, the maritime safety directorate has drafted a code of safe practice for recreational craft which will be ready for publication shortly. The code sets out recommended safety practices on board recreational craft and also the statutory safety requirements as they apply to such craft. It has been developed for application to recreational craft operating in Irish waters. It covers all types of sailing and motorboats and also craft such as ski boats, jet skis, canoes and kayaks. It also incorporates both competitive and non-competitive use of recreational craft.I note what the two Senators have said and I assure the House that the issue of the safe use of jet skis and other such craft remains a priority of the Minister. I regret that the Minister could not come to the House at the last minute, but I will convey the Senators' concerns to him.
