            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">The evaluation of files for release to the national archives is carried out by designated officials in my Department.  It is normal, as files are processed for release each year, that some are certified by the appropriate officials for retention on the grounds set forth in the Act.  Under section 8(6) of the National Archives Act 1986, provision is made for the review of closed records at five-yearly intervals from the date the certificate to withhold the records is made.  My Department complies with its statutory obligation in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">A total of 721 files or file parts were transferred to the national archives to be released for public inspection on 1 January 2009.  Some 12 files were withheld, of which one was withheld under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>) of the Act and 11 were withheld under section 8(4)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_8">As regards the 1978 Northern Ireland files, 85 files were released and no files were withheld.  Some 61 files were released without any abstractions, while 24 files contained documents which were either abstracted or had partial abstractions made on them.  In total, 177 entire documents were abstracted from 22 files and partial abstractions were made on 21 documents from seven files.  Abstractions were made under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).  The abstractions related to information given in confidence, including security information and certain personal information about individuals.  The majority of the documents were withheld because they contained personal information.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">There was a larger number of Northern Ireland documents, 112 in total, abstracted this year in comparison to last year due to the large number of correspondence on five files containing personal information relating to people arrested, detained or in prison.  The documents were mainly letters from relatives of prisoners and statements by prisoners, medical reports, reports of confidential conversations between Irish officials and contacts in Northern Ireland and letters or notes containing personal information or confidential material.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">I do not expect the Taoiseach follows the guidelines of the British Government in every matter but I note Jack Straw, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, recently accepted the case for a substantial cut, from 30 years to 15 years, in the release time for archival government papers.  Similar adjustments have been made in other countries such as South Africa, the Netherlands and France.  In Ireland, the time limit remains at 30 years.  Does the Taoiseach have any view as to whether it should be reduced?</p>
            <p eId="para_11">A UK report into the time limit stated the UK's freedom of information legislation effectively scuppered the 30-year archive rule.  As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Freedom of Information Act 2003 ensures Cabinet minutes must be released no later than ten years after their adoption which is less than the 30-year limit.  Does the Taoiseach believe the 30-year limit should be reduced substantially?  Does he accept the Freedom of Information Act, if applied broadly and appropriately, effectively scuppers the 30-year rule in any event?</p>

            <p eId="para_12">A case would have to be made as to why the limit should be reduced.  The idea behind the National Archives Act is to assist historians by releasing State papers from 30 years ago every year and giving them valuable insights into Governments' analyses at the time.  Those studying and examining those historical events find the State papers a valuable research resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">Freedom of information legislation is of the 1990s vintage.  Under the 30-year rule, State papers up until 1978 are released.  This period was a particularly difficult time in our history.  It requires the full safeguards and caution provided under the National Archives Act which is consistent with both providing material of historical significance while ensuring people, who may through inappropriate documentation being made available, be put at risk, endangered or compromised.  As I outlined in the response, there is personal material contained in some State documents which would not be relevant under the National Archives Act.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I share the Taoiseach's views on the sensitivity of that period.  However, I believe the limit should be reduced substantially from 30 years.  If the Freedom of Information Act were applied, people would be entitled to get information in as broad a way as possible without infringing issues of national security.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">The latest State papers that were released are interesting in many ways.  For instance, the late and much lamented singer, Joe Dolan, was under surveillance when he went to Moscow in the 1970s.  I am not sure whether this was usual procedure for people who travelled to the former USSR or other eastern bloc states.  In the 1970s, there was an enormous controversy about the business of nuclear power stations and the one proposed to be built at Carnsore Point, County Wexford.  An official in the Department of the Taoiseach, who I assume is no longer there, wrote in a memo that there was "little time to be lost before placing orders for a nuclear station".  It was as if one could wave a wand and have a station placed wherever one liked.  In view of comments made by various individuals and organisations recently, is the Government giving the matter of nuclear power any consideration?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_16">This is not a matter to which the Government is giving active consideration.  However, 30 years ago, in light of the second oil crisis, the problem of our dependence on fossil fuels and the fact that the question of climate change had not yet arisen, it was a valid subject for examination.  At present, energy independence is not only a fashionable but also an important topic of discussion and policy formulation throughout the world.  The issue to which the Deputy refers was brought into sharp relief 30 years ago in the context of the impact on our balance of payments and the significant rise in oil revenues.  In addition, gas had not been accessed in our territorial waters at that stage.  Exploration, resource management and the ability to identify natural resources which could be commercialised were live political issues at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">One can examine papers that are 30 years old with the benefit of hindsight and experience.  Many of the developments that have taken place would militate against the requirement for Ireland to consider such a proposal at present.  The putting in place of a number of interconnectors to allow Ireland operate within a wider regional energy market probably represents the best means by which we can ensure we will be able to generate our own capacity and have access to other supplies of electricity that are competitively priced.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">Were any of the files relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings withheld?  On the wider issue of releasing files, given that any sensitive material — such as that relating to individuals, etc. — is withheld in any event and that information of a contemporary interest can be made available under the Freedom of Information Act, is there a good reason for retaining the 30-year rule?  Many of the files which attract public attention and which are released under the 30-year rule relate to Northern Ireland.  In light of the situation in the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement, is there any reason all of the Cabinet files relating to Northern Ireland — albeit pruned down as happens under the 30-year rule — should not now be made available?  Rather than releasing the 1979 files next year and the 1980 files the year after, all of the files relating to Northern Ireland could be made available in order that those studying the situation in the North would be able to examine them in their totality.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">The position with regard to files relating to the management of the economy is similar.  In light of current events, it probably would be instructive if information relating to the 1980s and 1990s were made available.  Again, this could be pruned to remove material of a sensitive nature.  We could also take this course of action in respect of files containing information on our relations with Europe.  A period of 30 years is quite long and the information to which I refer belongs to a time which predates the Freedom of Information Act.  Why is the 30-year rule being retained?</p>

If there is a wider policy issue regarding the efficacy of having these rules in place in the first instance, perhaps parliamentary questions to that effect might elicit a more considered reply.  My immediate reaction is that one can consider certain aspects of the questions being asked.  I would not announce a change in the present policy position without carefully considering the pros and cons.</p>

Where does the authority rest to withhold the release of files which would be due for release under the 30 year rule?  Given the overlap between the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs on matters pertaining to the Six Counties and relations with the British Government, are such issues jointly addressed by these Departments?

I have no direct or indirect involvement in what is released or not released.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">The National Archives Act 1986 provides that under certain circumstances files or parts of files can be withheld from release.  This provision is set out under section 8(4)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), which provide for withholding of material in the following circumstances, namely, when it is in the public interest to do so, when information has been supplied in confidence and where releasing the material would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that it contains information about individuals.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">My question refers to the chairs of the boards of banks that have received the State guarantee.  The Taoiseach should be in a position to have them come before Dáil committees to answer questions.  Given the controversy surrounding the former director of FÁS and the chief executive of the regulatory authority, who both received serious amounts of money when they left their positions, does the Taoiseach think there is an opportunity to write into the conditions for all future contract appointments that abuse of privilege or straying outside the remit of one's appointment would result in non-payment of a golden handshake?  I note, for example, the Committee on Finance and the Public Service has stated that the sums paid to the regulator should be taken back.  This is clearly a cause for serious public anxiety.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The Taoiseach's predecessor has stated in response to questions that Dáil committees should have some sort of role in the appointment of persons to State boards, and important boards in particular.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if the Government or a Minister intends to appoint a person to a somewhat important State board, that person should appear before a committee to explain what he or she can offer the board in question, in other words, his or her qualifications to deal with Government policy in so far as the board's remit is concerned?  The previous Taoiseach said that he would involve committees to some extent, not in an interrogatory role but to give the prospective appointee an opportunity to set out his or her qualifications and experience and what he or she proposes to bring to the board.  This might result in a better situation than what has obtained heretofore under all Governments.</p>

Committees have the right and entitlement to invite people before them to discuss a range of policy questions not only in respect of the particular competencies they bring to the operation of State boards but also in terms of the policies that are being implemented, which are presumably consistent with Government policy as outlined by the relevant Minister.  I understand that facility is available to all committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">The question also relates to the conditions and contracts of employment which boards enter into with the executives they appoint.  Presumably they act on legal advice on any arrangements arrived at subsequently in terms of severance or other matters.</p>

I understand this is an interim authority pending the enactment of legislation providing for the broadcasting authority of Ireland, which represents a further reform of broadcasting.  If my memory serves me correctly, this legislation will see the establishment of a broadcasting commission.  In respect of the interim authority being announced this afternoon, the question of committees having an input or making further suggestions to the Minister is an innovation instigated by the latter.</p>

Will the Taoiseach accept as highly questionable the efficacy of appointing former board members of discredited financial institutions to State boards and the continued service on the boards of State bodies of former members of boards of institutions such as, for example, Anglo Irish Bank?  Does the Taoiseach propose, in the context of reform and redress of the whole process of appointments to State boards, to take into account the facts in regard to a number of these bodies and the fact that former directors of Anglo Irish Bank are currently serving on the boards of public bodies despite all the questions that remain unanswered in regard to the extent of the knowledge of people at the helm of Anglo Irish Bank down through the years of its highly irregular and illegal activities?</p>

            <p eId="para_787">The Deputy will be aware these are matters that are under investigation.  In the interests of the principle of accountability not being breached, it is important those given the authority to act independently, as provided for under Acts of the Oireachtas, are able to do their job in respect of any issue referred to them.  That is what is happening in regard to the specific case mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">All non-executive members of boards, namely, board appointees, are dependent upon the information provided to them by executive members of management in terms of papers supplied to the board for the purpose of overseeing policy and giving strategic direction to the organisation of which they are members.  One should not, therefore, presume upon the idea that non-executive members of the board were, in the first instance, informed or in all circumstances <i>au fait</i> with any inappropriate or unacceptable conduct brought to their attention.  As I stated, the specific case referred to by the Deputy is under investigation and should be allowed, in the interests of everybody, to be pursued vehemently and vigorously and brought to a conclusion in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">My response, in general terms, is that the performance of those who are members of State boards determines their suitability or otherwise in respect of any particular job.  It should be stated — this is not always recognised — that people who take up appointment as members of boards, be they semi-State or non-commercial organisations, many of which are public service in nature, do so out of a sense of public service and in the interests of pursuing objectives which serve the common good.</p>

I am not sure whether these two entities will continue as separate entities or if they are to be merged.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the position or positions to be filled will be opened up to competition not alone in Ireland, but from abroad to ensure people who believe they have the qualifications to fulfil those roles will have an opportunity to apply for appointment?  Does the Taoiseach envisage an involvement of the relevant Dáil committee with such people to allow them to outline their qualifications, experience and what they could bring to the position to be filled, whether it is a regulator, governorship or an amalgamated position?  I would like to see a situation whereby State boards, when employing a chief executive, write into the contract of employment that if the position of responsibility is abused then any golden handshakes simply do not apply.  For example if a young garda graduates from Templemore, signs a contract and serves for 30 years, but abuses that privilege, that person should lose all of the benefits that come with being a member of the Garda Síochána.  Recently, there has been a seething anger on the streets as a result of what has occurred.  That should be regulated and controlled and the Taoiseach is in a position to do so and I will support him in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_795">The question of reforms that will take place in respect of regulatory matters, financial and otherwise, but especially financial, in the present circumstances, is something that has been accorded the highest priority by the Minister for Finance.  He would intend to bring proposals to Government very shortly regarding that matter.  It would be his intention in respect of any vacancies that arise or any posts to be filled, that we would employ people who would be eminently suitable and capable of doing a job which would be, perhaps, a different type of job from that which was the case in the past.  In respect of contracts of employment entered into by authorities with executive management or anyone else, it is always open to an authority to have available to it not only rights of compensation, but rights of dismissal in the event of that being warranted.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">I referred to the need for reform of the appointments process, in respect of which my question was quite particular, in line with the questions I and others have already asked this afternoon. What reform measures does the Taoiseach now intend to make?  I do not ask this on the basis of making judgments in respect of anyone who has served in these capacities.  Would the Taoiseach not accept the important need to ensure public confidence in the appointments system, and confidence into the future in respect of those entrusted with these responsibilities in the interest of the public in the first instance?  The particular areas of crossover I have indicated <i>vis-à-vis</i> Anglo Irish Bank stretch into such bodies as Forfás, Bord na Móna and the Dublin Airport Authority, to name but some.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">Is the Taoiseach in a position, or has he taken the time, to inform himself of the extent of the crossover between directors and members of the boards of financial institutions and those appointed by this and previous Administrations, especially in the past decade or 12 years, to various State bodies?  Would the Taoiseach not accept in respect of those appointed heretofore that now is a very good time to review the practice of appointment in a non-judgmental sense, and to open it up to transparency and to the full raft of very good citizens with a variety of experiences who could bring their own special knowledge and expertise to these State boards in the future?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_798">As I have said, there are many people who act on State boards, some in the singular and some in the plural who have shown and displayed not only a strong commitment to public service, but a strong competence and professionalism and have brought these particular attributes to the fore in respect of their involvement in State boards throughout the years.  Among the requirements for appointment to a board with a major role are financial management and accountancy skills, and familiarity with procedures in that area.  Those are prerequisites for any role in corporate governance.  Many people — I will not go into the specifics — have displayed all these attributes through their business experiences as executives running organisations, which they bring to bear beneficially in non-executive capacities.  Non-executive board members of any organisation require and depend on the papers provided to them by executives in order to ask questions or inquire into any policy directive or initiative consistent with the strategic direction set out by the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">One cannot make the assumptions the Deputy makes regarding some of the matters still under investigation.  Let the investigation point it out and bring it to the fore in due course based on the facts.  The Deputy asks for a non-judgmental approach but the best way to achieve that is to consider the performance of the executives within the organisations they serve.  It remains a matter for individual board members to indicate whether they are no longer in a position to serve for personal or professional reasons.  I am sure they take that into account in determining the length of their tenure on any of these boards.</p>

The practice initiated when Deputy Gilmore's party took office in 1992, requiring matters to be brought to the attention of party leaders before State board appointments were decided, continues.  As the Deputy knows, every State board does not require prior formal Government approval.  The specific matter he raises would have been discussed.  The Minister would have brought this to my attention recently and I would have left the ultimate decision to the Minister, as is my practice, and I would inquire whether the formation or composition of a board had a broad range and balance of competence and skills to ensure it was effective.  I do not lay down preconditions or set formulae.  I like to see people, regardless of their background, being brought forward on the basis of their ability to contribute.  The sponsoring Minister needs to consider the competencies of the people in question.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I understand that in November 2008, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions asked the Labour Court to review the national minimum wage and to make a recommendation on its adjustment to me.  The court subsequently invited submissions on the issue.  Various submissions were received from IBEC, ICTU, the Department of Finance and other interested parties.  The Labour Court held discussions with these parties.  I understand the matter is being considered by the court.  If the court is satisfied that general agreement on an appropriate minimum wage has been reached by the various parties, it will recommend that rate to me.  If general agreement is not reached following the consultations, however, the Labour Court can make a recommendation to me anyway.  In doing so, the Labour Court would need to have regard to the movement of earnings of employees, the relevant exchange rate movement and the likely impact on employment, unemployment, inflation and national competitiveness.  When I consider any Labour Court recommendation on the minimum wage, I am required under the relevant legislation to take into account the impact the proposed rate might have on employment, the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness.  The key consideration is to ensure the national minimum wage is set at an appropriate rate.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment or express views on the level of the minimum wage in advance of the Labour Court recommendation.</p>

            <p eId="para_806">I am asking this question at a time of rising unemployment.  As the Minister of State knows, between 600 and 700 jobs are being lost in this country every day.  More than 150,000 people have lost their jobs since the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is reasonably estimated that at least 500,000 people will be on the dole by the end of the year.  I believe employers and employees need certainty.  In recent weeks, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs has suggested that the minimum wage might be reduced.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has called for an increase of up to €1 in the minimum wage.  We need clear direction and certainty from the Government.  Employees need to know that the minimum wage, which is extremely low, will not be cut.  Employers need to have certainty about their labour costs for the next two or three years.  It is important, regardless of the Labour Court's recommendations, for Ministers to clearly state that the minimum wage will neither increase nor decrease over the next two years.  That would give employees and employers the certainty they need, regardless of the recommendation that is made.</p>

            <p eId="para_807">I thank the Deputy.  I did not suggest that the minimum wage should be increased or decreased.  I pointed out that I am obliged under the relevant Act to consider any recommendation that is made to me by the Labour Court.  When the Labour Court is adjudicating on this matter, it is obliged to seek submissions and to take into account issues such as employment, unemployment, inflation and national competitiveness.  When it decides on a rate and makes it known to me, as the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs of the day, I will have to make a decision within three months on whether to accept, reject or amend it.  Statutory provision has been made.  I do not think we should override the legislation that was passed by this House.  When the Labour Court makes known its findings to me, I will have three months to make known my decision to the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_810">We need to get real.  If the Labour Court follows the terms of the Act by taking into account issues like employment and competitiveness, the only conclusion it will be possible for the court to reach will be to recommend a major reduction in the minimum wage.  We have been losing jobs by the second since our competitiveness fell off a cliff.  That is where the economy is.  If the Labour Court is faithful to the legislation in this area, the only proposal it will be possible for the court to make will be a savage cut in the minimum wage.  That would be wrong and most inappropriate.  We need the Government to govern, rather than to outsource its power to agencies, courts, bodies and the social partners.  It should clarify its policy on the minimum wage.  I suggest that its policy should be to provide for no increase or decrease in the minimum wage for at least two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_814">I am simply making the point that the Labour Court will make its adjudications.  It consists of wise counsel and is well represented and reflective of the broader society out there.  When the court makes the determination, we will make an adjudication on that.  Until such time as it does this, I will not give my personal opinion because that would undermine the court's decisions.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_816">The total number of people on the live register for January 2009 is 327,861, which is an increase of 146,412 since January 2008.  The live register is not designed to measure unemployment, as it includes part time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.  Employment and unemployment are measured by the quarterly national household survey and published by the Central Statistics Office.  In the third quarter of 2008, which is the most recent quarter for which data is available, employment decreased by 25,200 over 12 months to a current total of 2,120,800.   Unemployment increased by 53,300 in the same period to 160,000.  The CSO is releasing fourth quarter results of the quarterly national household survey next Friday, 27 February.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">The rise in unemployment is particularly unwelcome and is a sign of the difficult times that global economies are facing.  The Government is determined to do all in its power to support the rising number of people who have lost their jobs.  My Department, FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together to respond quickly and effectively to the rising live register numbers.  FÁS employment services and FÁS local employment services are putting in place measures designed to provide increased capacity for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the increased number of unemployed seeking job search assistance voluntarily.  The implementation of these measures has increased the capacity of job search services from 6,500 to 12,250 persons per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">To assist individuals through the provision of education and training opportunities, I recently announced the availability of 51,000 new training places under the FÁS training initiatives strategy.  These places are in addition to the 27,000 places that were previously planned for 2009, under the bridging foundation training, specific skills training and traineeships programmes.  They are specifically tailored for individuals who wish to add to their existing skills level and improve their prospects of re-entering the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">In response to the significant downturn in construction related activity since the beginning of 2008, FÁS has established a training fund to enable redundant workers to provide a timely response to identified training and re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  This will enable individuals to secure a speedy return to work.  Where this cannot be secured, it will provide relevant upskilling opportunities so that job seekers can secure employment in alternative sectors.  FÁS is also focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers.  These include redundant apprentices being allowed to move on to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">A register of redundant apprentices has been established by FÁS and the institutes of technology to identify these people at the earliest possible stage and FÁS has prioritised the need to locate employers to sponsor the completion of the apprentices' off-the-job training.   These measures will operate in parallel with the FÁS employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme, which aims to provide up to 500 redundant apprentices with on-the-job training with certain approved employers on a rotation basis during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The Government intends to achieve greater capacity within existing resources to meet the ongoing challenges in the labour market.  In this context, we will bring forward further measures to make training and education services available to a greater number of unemployed persons over the coming weeks and months to ensure timely and comprehensive access to the full range of services provided by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">The Government's focus will also be very much on supporting and promoting enterprise development to create new jobs.  The enterprise development agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and create jobs, even in the current challenging climate.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.  To continue to facilitate this we need to ensure that our competitiveness is sustained into the future.</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_62">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_824">Unemployment is rising at the rate of 1,500 per day.  Two thirds of those unemployed are men and 25% of them are under the age of 25.  Unpaid redundancies are costing the Government €50 million per year.  The estimated cost to the State for each unemployed person is around €20,000, when social welfare contributions and taxes forgone to the State are taken into account.  I estimate that the total cost of 400,000 unemployed people is €8 billion per year, but if Deputy Varadkar's figures are right, then it will cost €10 billion per year.  That is a huge amount of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">Can these resources be invested in educating and upskilling the potential workforce?  The key recommendation of the national skills strategy group, which reported in 2007, was that the education sector is the major vehicle for the necessary upskilling which is required.  We told the Minister about the redundancies last year, yet she just threw up her hands.  Why was that redundancy package not put in place last year?  There is no use sticking one's finger in the dyke, when the water is cascading in and about to drown us all.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Why are the 51,000 people all attending FÁS?  Why should they not be placed with VECs, which could provide another opportunity for retraining.  FETAC, PLCs and institutes of technology provide a wide range of courses that allow for upskilling and retraining.  They can focus on the design and delivery of courses in sustainable energy and green technology techniques.  Why are the redundant apprentices all attending FÁS?</p>
            <p eId="para_827">A headline in one today's newspapers states that the education cuts will cost at least 9,000 school leavers and jobless people a place on a further education course from next September.  There are many jobs being lost at 33 VECs.  Is there any joined up thinking taking place at all?</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Is the Minister going to do anything for indigenous industry?  Are we afraid of bringing in employment grants to help to get people back to work?  Is the back-to-work allowance scheme going to be expanded?  Will the VTOS be expanded?  Is the back-to-education allowance still curtailed by the imposition of stupid limits?  The Minister should get rid of all the eligibility criteria and get the people moving.  We are in a new situation that requires drastic solutions, not the same solutions dressed up in a new bottle.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">The Deputy is as sincere as everybody else in the House about this issue, and I would like to tell him that we have a co-ordinated approach and we work within all the Departments that are relevant to training and upskilling.  The Minister of State is involved in the co-ordination of the skills programme and the reorientation of the skills needs of workers.  That is only a part of all that is happening.  We have provided a facility for 2,200 redundant young people to allow them to fulfil their opportunities from an educational perspective.  We are working with the Minister for Education and Science and with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to provide new initiatives in the back to education scheme and the back to work scheme.  There is a co-ordinated approach in dealing with these issues.  We have short, medium and long-term resolutions to these problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">We are also working on the task of sustaining people in employment by supporting industry.  The methods as to how that can be done are being pursued with industry to ensure that the greatest outcomes will be afforded to people.  We cannot have a situation where we have training for training's sake.  It must be linked to where new opportunities will arise.  On that basis, the skills strategy is being re-orientated to deal with the immediacy of what is happening.  That is what we are doing with the convergence and the transferability of skills from people with existing skills and from others.  We are working towards other programmes for graduates and others with different skill types.  These are not necessarily the focus of FÁS.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">As a member of the Government, the Tánaiste is responsible for the provision of credit.  I know a person in south Westmeath who started a business from scratch, and who now employs eight people.  The person changed the business from that of a sole trader to a limited company on 1 February, and sought €3,000 for an overdraft, something that already existed when the business was that of a sole trader.  The bank refused the company the overdraft, even though the taxpayers are putting money into that same bank.  The company had invested €200,000 of its own money and was investing a further €50,000 of profits into a development project, which would employ up to 20 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">I wrote to Mr. Brian Goggin, the chief executive of Bank of Ireland.  He must have known I was coming back to the House today.  I e-mailed him on the 13 February and received a reply.</p>

We also examined the issues the Deputy raised which are pertinent to all of us in business.  We expressly said if we are to sustain employment and create new opportunities, we must allow those entrepreneurs to continue in that capacity.  We are also examining how guidance for smaller companies through the county enterprise boards in providing new opportunities, such as refundable loans, would allow a little more traction for such companies.  The Minister of State is dealing with this.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">It is a matter of concern that some of the banks do not have a business acumen.  On that basis my agency, Enterprise Ireland, will make available people with business expertise in a new initiative with the banks to allow them the opportunity to have a greater acumen and support business, which is a most important initiative on which we have embarked.

            <p eId="para_848">Pharmaceutical exports from Ireland are valued at €34 billion annually, achieved by 80 companies employing 20,000 people.  The pharma and biopharma sectors are extremely important for Ireland and have experienced significant growth in recent years.  The outlook for Ireland in terms of development and manufacturing is that in spite of intense competition, we will still secure investment in both the small molecule or pharma area and also in the large molecule or biopharma sector.  Ireland has a long history in the sector and eight of the top ten major pharmaceutical companies now have a major presence here.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Much of IDA Ireland's engagement with the companies is around securing additional investment and business functions from the established client base.  With over 40 years of investment in Ireland, the operating environment is recognised as world class, with excellent infrastructure and specialist services and a regulatory record that is second to none.  IDA Ireland is continuing to win development projects from the pharma sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The single most effective strategy of securing the future of manufacturing at the Irish sites is giving the Irish companies a role in new product development.  Major investment projects currently under way include Merck in Carlow, Teva in Waterford, Eli Lilly in Kinsale, Genzyme in Waterford, Gilead Sciences in Cork and Hovione in Cork.  These projects, which are mainly at an advanced construction stage, will lead to the creation of 800 jobs and involve substantial capital investment of over €800 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The key objectives of Enterprise Ireland's three-year strategy for the development of this sector are to accelerate indigenous export growth by €175 million; build a platform for longer-term growth in the sector; build client innovation capability; and drive improved leadership and management competencies.  These are all positive developments.  However, in international markets the traditional pharma sector has been experiencing somewhat slower growth.  This is due to a combination of factors including patent expiries, a decline in product pipelines, increased costs of clinical and pre-clinical research, pressure on pharmaceutical prices, increased costs of marketing and sales and greater intensity of competition.  There has been a decline in research and development productivity and generic drugs have been achieving greater market share.  Given these developments, it is more important than ever to concentrate in Ireland on building the infrastructure to support a healthy, vibrant pharmaceutical industry, an industry firmly rooted in the sciences.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The Government has strongly committed to this.  Over the last decade or so we have put in place the programme for research in third level institutions which focused on building world class research facilities and capability under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.  Science Foundation Ireland was established to attract world-class researchers to Ireland and promote world-class research activity, focusing mainly on life sciences and ICT.  With these foundations in place, the Government is committed to further developing the sector.  We have a clear vision in place, which is being carried out through the implementation of our national strategy for science, technology and innovation for 2006 to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">With regard to dialogue with the sector, the Tánaiste and her Ministers frequently meet individual companies from the whole range of sectors.  For example, on a recent IDA Ireland investment promotion mission in the US last November, the Tánaiste met a range of companies including four from the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">On the question of manufacturing, the 2008 report of the high level group on manufacturing identified the actions to be taken by all stakeholders to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland.  The report sets out a number of recommendations directed at innovation, productivity leading to transformational change and reskilling and management development.  It also identifies a need to increase awareness and take-up of existing supports.  In the recent review of Towards 2016, the social partners agreed that a manufacturing forum should be established to monitor and ensure the implementation of the report's recommendations.  The members of the forum are now being appointed.</p>

I would like if the Minister of State could answer me on two issues that have come into the media recently.  These are GlaxoSmithKline, GSK, which is reported to plan to cut back 6,000 to 10,000 jobs internationally.  What steps has the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment taken to address that or to contact GSK to see if any jobs in this country will be affected?  Pfizer and Wyeth employ 5,500 people in this country and Lipitor, one of the drugs that Pfizer manufactures in Cork, will go off the market in 2011.  What steps has the Department taken in those two areas to ensure there will be no job losses in those areas in this country?</p>

The takeover of Wyeth by Pfizer is undergoing due diligence in the international arena.  US and EU competition law must be examined.

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_860">Since 2004, Irish labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the European Union.  For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies — green cards, work permits, spousal and dependant work permits and permits for intra-company transferees — were introduced under the Employment Permits Act 2006 and came into effect on 1 February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">The green card scheme replaced the previous work visa or work authorisation scheme and is available for occupations where there are strategically important high-level skills shortages.  A green card can be issued for an extensive list of occupations with annual salaries of €60,000 and above, and for a specified list of high skilled occupations with salaries between €30,000 and €60,000.  No labour market test is required for the green card applications.  Green cards are issued for two years initially and will normally lead to the granting of permanent or long-term residence after that.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The work permit scheme is mainly for non-green card occupations in the €30,000 to €60,000 annual salary range.  A work permit may be granted only in exceptional circumstances for occupations with salaries below €30,000.  There are also a number of categories of employment for which work permits will not to be considered, as vacancies for such positions can be filled from within the EEA.  Work permits are the subject of a labour market needs test and are granted initially for a period of two years, and then for a further period of up to three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">Currently employment permit holders constitute approximately 1.5% of the total labour force.  Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the numbers of permit applications and consequent numbers of permits issued over the last six months have been showing a consistent downward trend.  Our employment permit arrangements are being reviewed to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">Why have the work permit and green card schemes not been reviewed since 2006?  Although we have had a dramatic shift in economic circumstances we are only now reviewing the conditions for those schemes.  While I accept that the number of work permits issued over the last seven months has decreased — a figure of 1,100 is significantly down on the previous period — the issue is not only the figures but of perception.  The Government needs to be seen to be on top of the issue.  Is there any plan to introduce a labour market test for the green card?  Have any discussions taken place with the Minister of State with responsibility for integration policy, Deputy Conor Lenihan?</p>

            <p eId="para_865">The schemes are reviewed every six months.  There is a constant change in the context of the labour market and that change is reflected in the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">The statistics, both here and across Europe, indicate that the numbers coming in to seek employment are reducing quite rapidly.  There is a need for us to adjust accordingly and as that change takes place, depending on the area about which we speak, the adjustment is made in terms of policy and what we are doing.  Currently, a review is being undertaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_867">Is it the case that the fees established for employment permits have not been reviewed since January 2007?  While employment permit holders make up 1.5% of the labour force, they make up 3% on the live register, or 10,000 people, resulting in a loss to the economy on an annual basis of approximately €200 million.  Would it not make sense to waive the fee for migrants who are resident here and who are in receipt of employment permits as this would remove the barrier for such migrants who are legally entitled to PRSI-based social welfare payments and give them the opportunity to take up a job for the period up to the expiry of their work permits?  At present, they do not have the opportunity to avail of that because employers will not pay the fees and in the vast majority of cases the migrants do not have the resources to pay those fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_886">——Deputy Naughten is good at writing to me about them too — finding themselves without work or with reduced working weeks.  Our approach to tackling the issue is multi-layered and centres on restoring our public finances, protecting employment across the economy, retraining those without work, and attracting new investment and jobs to our shores.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">As regards strengthening our jobsearch supports, at my request, FÁS's employment services together with local employment services is putting in place measures designed to provide increased capacity in jobsearch supports for the increased number of unemployed.  The implementation of these measures will increase capacity from 6,500 per month to at least 12,250 per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">The Government is also working to significantly improve access for unemployed persons to maximise opportunities for upskilling and reskilling so that people will be better placed to avail of new job opportunities when they become available.  A number of programmes are already in place and it is intended to expand greatly the frequency and range of these programmes over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I recently announced the availability of 51,000 new training places under the FÁS training initiatives strategy, which brings to 78,000 the total short training course places under the bridging foundation training, specific skills training and traineeships programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">The training initiative strategy enhances the traditional mix of course offerings and will be delivered through three core training initiatives, short courses, night courses and on-line courses.  The courses are for highly employable persons who wish to add to their existing skills level and improve their prospects of re-entering the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">In addition, FÁS is responding to the major increase in the numbers of people within the construction sector who have found themselves out of work and the increase in the number of apprentices being made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">We have established a training fund to provide a timely response to identified training and re-training needs for low-skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  FÁS is also focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas such as the installation of energy efficient and renewable technologies, environmental activity, and compliance and regulatory work.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">On redundant apprentices, my Department and FÁS have put in place a series of actions to facilitate more than 2,200 apprentices to complete their studies.  These include apprentices being allowed to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.  A register of redundant apprentices has been established by FÁS and the institutes of technology in order to identify these people at the earliest possible point and we have prioritised the need to locate an employer to sponsor the completion of the apprentices' off-the-job training.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Last year I announced the launch of FÁS employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme, which operates this year and aims to provide up to 500 redundant apprentices with on-the-job training with certain approved employers on a rotation basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_896">Further help for those who have become distanced from the labour market for some time and who are seeking to re-enter is provided by the community employment, CE, scheme.  CE is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">While a significant amount of work has been done in a short space of time, the Government is intent on achieving greater capacity within existing resources.  In this context we will bring forward further measures to make training and education services available to a greater number of unemployed persons over the coming weeks and months.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">In addition to the activation measures that I have set out today, this Government's focus will also be very much on supporting the growth of Irish companies with the ambition, leadership and innovation to succeed in creating and sustaining employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_900">I note her own reports in the newspaper today about what might be announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, that is, letting people keep their benefits on going back to work.  That is one idea of a scheme, but is she against the concept of Government organised labour activation schemes which would get people out there working on much needed projects such as school buildings, parks, walkways, train stations, bus stations and council housing stock?  All such work could be done through Government activation schemes, either using the local authority or whatever.  Is the Tánaiste against that concept, yes or no?  I have been asking for a long time.  I think it is a good concept.  I have not received any reaction from the Government on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The Tánaiste visited SR Technics on Thursday last.  Can she enlighten us any further?  Is there any chance another company would be willing to buy it out?  First, is SR Technics willing to sell to anybody?  In addition, is there any way that the Government——</p>

        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_126" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_928">Employment regulation orders are made by the Labour Court on foot of proposals from joint labour committees.  JLCs are statutory bodies, established by the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, to provide machinery for the fixing of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment in particular sectors.  JLCs operate in sectors where collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">A joint labour committee is composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in the sector and they meet regularly, under an independent chairman, to discuss and agree terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector.  When it reaches agreement on terms and conditions, the JLC publishes details and invites submissions.  Following consideration of any submissions, the committee may make proposals to the Labour Court for making an ERO.  The making of an ERO has the effect of making the pay rates and conditions contained in it legally enforceable.  The terms and conditions set down in the EROs are a matter for agreement by the joint labour committees and I do not propose to amend the legislation to change this.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">In the context of the recent review and transitional agreement 2008-09, the social partners agreed to a series of further measures to support the JLC system.  These will include the introduction of legislation to strengthen the existing system for the making of both employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements to provide for their continued effective operation; and measures to provide for improved operational procedures to include the nomination of chairmen for JLCs, following consultation with the social partners, for a fixed term of office and the continued enhancement of expertise and competencies through the practice of nominating chairmen on the basis of their experience and qualifications for the role.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">I am conscious of the difficulties that many firms operating in sectors covered by EROs are experiencing at the moment.  In recent months I have met representatives of employer organisations and heard at first hand of the difficulties with regard to wage costs.  I have consistently advised employers to make their concerns known through their representatives at the social partnership table and to pursue the issues actively through the established mechanism of the relevant joint labour committee.  In my view, the parties represented on the JLC are best placed to address the impact of the economic crisis on employment levels and the viability of services in the relevant sector.</p>

This country is haemorrhaging jobs, we are on the edge of an abyss and it is possible that in a few months time we will not be able to make out debt payments or even pay our own salaries.  At the coalface are those industries covered by EROs in retail, hotels, restaurants, security, construction and agriculture.  These industries are losing jobs because they cannot meet the terms of the employment regulation orders and they cannot meet the pay increases the Government will not pay but is making them pay.  The Government must make the decision to change the system, review the existing employment regulation orders and make JLCs equal so there is a level playing field between employees and employers with no voting rights for the independent chair.</p>

One must get that balance right, but at the end of the day it is in the hands of industry.  For many years, JLCs were not as responsive to the needs of industry because there was a consistently upward curve.  Now that there are challenges, however, they need to come together in a spirit of partnership, as has been the case.  They are chaired by an independent chairperson and can bring in expertise and get assistance to strike the rates, pay and conditions that reflect the industry.  I assure the Deputy that, in the context of enforcement, our labour inspectors are active.  In fact, some people in this House think they are too active.  It is always difficult to achieve a balance.</p>

They can work if they are more responsive in difficult times.  I am quite sure that people can come together from both sides — industry and employees — and, more importantly, the chair is independent.  That issue is also being looked at in the context of the review of JLCs and the amalgamation of same as a commitment in Towards 2016.</p>

        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if she has plans to establish a State guaranteed loan for small and medium enterprises; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_162" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
            <p eId="para_975">I have no plans to establish a State guaranteed loan for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  The Government's recapitalisation scheme for Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, announced on Wednesday, 11 February 2009, is a fundamental requirement in restoring stability to our financial sector.  Such stability will ensure that the financial institutions can actively contribute to our economic activity and particularly support our enterprise sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">A key principle of the recapitalisation package is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly for SMEs.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of the overall package.  This package contains a range of initiatives that will directly assist our enterprise sector in facilitating access to credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Under the recapitalisation scheme, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland have committed to measures to maintain a flow of credit to small businesses.  They have committed to increasing lending capacity to small and medium-sized enterprises by 10% and to providing an additional 30% capacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  A €100 million environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank, as well as a further €15 million each to new or existing seed capital funds.  Much of this funding will flow to small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The recapitalised banks have also agreed to fund and co-operate with an independent review of credit availability which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives and will report within five weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">A code of conduct for business lending to small and medium-sized enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February.  This code will facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions, and will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by banks.  The code should strengthen the bank-client relationship and develop greater trust and confidence in the banks' lending practices.  Banks are now actively promoting new lending as evidenced by recent press and television advertisements.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The Tánaiste met with representatives of the banks only last week and impressed upon them the need to ensure that credit is available to viable businesses.  She has asked the banks and enterprise support agencies to work closely together to facilitate lending to enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">Funding to the SME sector is also provided through my Department and the State enterprise support agencies.  The Department's continuous support for indigenous companies arises through maintaining a positive business environment and particular interventions from State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county and city enterprise boards.  The allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 will ensure that we continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">SMEs are central to our economic development and the range of measures and supports in place will continue to help the sector adapt to the current economic climate.  The services provided by the development agencies are kept under review and will be adjusted to respond to the current economic situation.</p>

As regards State-guaranteed loans for small and medium-sized businesses, the Tánaiste alluded earlier to the fact that she met with SR Technics earlier today.  The Minister of State also alluded to the fact that the Tánaiste met with the banks.  Has such an initiative for SR Technics, where 1,200 jobs are to go, been considered?  This is a viable business with 80% capacity booked on one line for the first two months of this year and 50% for the next line for the rest of the year.  There is no shortage of orders because the order book is active up to 2016.</p>

Are the banks going to support small industries, such as those to which I referred, to ensure their survival or, in the case I cited, an expansion?  If the other banks will not do so, we own Anglo Irish Bank.  Will the Tánaiste give a direction to that bank to go to the European Investment Bank and drawn down €1 billion of the €30 billion available so that it can be made available to small and medium-sized businesses at a particular rate of interest?  That is what will secure the future of our industries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1019">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 68 and 95 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">I am aware of several recent media reports which have speculated on the introduction of price controls as a way of tackling prices.  I have not made any commitment to the introduction of price controls.  I have said that I will consider introducing legislation if I find certain retailers, or other elements of the supply chain, whose actions are resulting in the consumer not receiving fair value.  I am prepared to consider all legislative options to address problems that persist or act as a barrier to fair competition or to the achievement of value for the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">Much media comment in this area has focused on the possible introduction of price control measures as a means of tackling the current differentials in prices between this jurisdiction, Northern Ireland and the UK.  Undoubtedly, the level of the differential in prices is giving rise to considerable concern, not only for consumers but also for the economy, given the impact they are having on employment, trade and revenue to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">Notwithstanding the Government's accepted preference of tackling price inflation through the promotion of competition and consumer choice, North-South price differentials have been a matter of concern for some time.  Given this, I have been actively engaged with various elements of the retail sector over the past several months to ensure Irish consumers benefit by way of lower prices from the appreciation in the value of the euro, particularly against sterling.  Given that the euro has appreciated by almost 30% in value over sterling in the past 18 months, it is unacceptable this has not translated into lower prices for consumers in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">It is incumbent on all links in the retail chain to ensure the greatest degree of transparency possible as to the reasons for the current North-South price differentials.  I will continue to pursue this issue with retailers, distributors, suppliers and manufacturers to ensure Irish consumers receive a fair deal and value for money when doing their day-to-day shopping.</p>

Nothing has increased more this year than government charges.  Why should we trust the Government to fix prices when it is responsible for most of the inflation rises?</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment withdraw the slur she made against Irish retailers?  In the main, they are not responsible for high prices; it is the Government that is responsible.  Government charges are the primary reason for high retail prices.  Will she withdraw the slur against Irish retailers and her encouragement to consumers to shop in other countries?</p>

Those are issues in the supply chain and route to market which are being investigated.  Under section 32 of the Competition Act 2002, the Competition Authority carries out studies on retail distribution and imports.  I do not have clarity on this issue and, therefore, I have asked the Competition Authority to investigate the matter and report to me by 30 April in order that I can address the issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1033">Since the House met last week, the banking situation has deteriorated.  We have had the publication of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, albeit a truncated version, and Anglo Irish Bank's end-of-year results.  Around the country, there is grave concern because it is difficult to get a grasp of the full range of the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">This morning the Garda fraud squad was sent into the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank, which is now State-owned.  This sends out its own message.  I am not going to be confrontational with the Taoiseach on what others consider to be petty points.  This is, however, about the credibility of the country's financial institutions.  This morning's Garda actions, which Deputy Charles Flanagan called for on several occasions, send out their own message.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I will put three simple questions to the Taoiseach.  First, what new information has come to his attention since the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank which has triggered the sending in of the Garda?  Second, has a direct instruction been given to all personnel, particularly senior personnel, in the now State-owned Anglo Irish Bank to co-operate fully with the ongoing investigation?  Finally, arising from this morning's actions, how does the Government propose to rectify Ireland's international financial credibility with the international markets ?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_201">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_1036">As the House is aware from news reports, this morning the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation was involved in an investigative operation in Anglo Irish Bank under the direction of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Any such investigation is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; the Government does not intervene in such investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">The following information has been made available by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in respect of the operation.  A Garda officer seconded to the ODCE obtained a search warrant from a judge of the District Court yesterday.  This warrant was executed today in accordance with the powers given to the director under section 20 of the Companies Act 1990, as amended.  The search was led by Garda officers who are seconded to the ODCE.  They were assisted by other officers attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and by ODCE staff.  The purpose of a search under section 20 is to acquire books, documents and other materials which may provide evidence of or relating to one or more suspected offences under the Companies Acts.  For operational reasons, the director will not be disclosing the suspected offence or offences in question, the premises searched or the name of the company to which the search relates.  The director will be making no comment on the matter at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">I have consistently made clear that the proper statutory bodies were investigating what occurred at Anglo Irish Bank and that the Government would do nothing to prejudice subsequent possible criminal or civil proceedings.  We must allow this investigation.  In that context, I do not wish to say anything which might prejudice future civil or criminal actions.  It is important to stress that customer deposits are fully covered by the guarantee.  When the bank was nationalised, it was made clear that it would continue to be run as a going concern.  All Members have an obligation to aware of the damage that inaccurate and inflammatory statements or speculation can do to the levels of confidence shown in Ireland by international financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">The issues which arose during the due diligence process and which were referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement are being investigated by him.  It is the view of the chairman, board and management of Anglo Irish Bank that there should be full co-operation with the officers who have the statutory and independent authority to deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The signal which needs to be sent out is that this matter is being investigated by the requisite authorities and that it is being pursued; that any suggestions to the contrary last week or at any other time are without foundation; and that there is a necessity to ensure we proceed with the reform of regulatory structures in order to instil public confidence.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that he intends to bring proposals in that regard before the Government in the near future.  This will be extremely beneficial in ensuring that people understand that it is the view of everyone inside and outside the House that we should have a reputable and properly functioning system.  That latter will ensure that the principle of accountability will apply and that, if appropriate, the full rigours of the law will be applied.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1041">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Obviously, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is dealing with this matter in the context of possible infringements of the Companies Acts.  The Fine Gael Party has a different view in respect of the investigation being carried out at Anglo Irish Bank and suggests that it should be done under the stewardship of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as distinct from the regulatory authority, which was part of the problem in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The situation that has arisen has dealt another hammer blow to the credit worthiness of Ireland Inc.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the markets do not actually care who owns this bank as long as credit worthiness is restored to our financial institutions.  In that context, I differ from him in the sense that I am of the view that Anglo Irish Bank should have been wound down over a period, in an orderly fashion, as opposed to being allowed to operate as a going concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The world is running out of patience with Ireland Inc.  As the Head of Government, the Taoiseach is in a position to take decisive action in order to attempt to rectify this problem before someone else rectifies it for us.  We must start on the long, slow and painful path away from the economic precipice on which we now stand.  The Taoiseach referred previously to bipartisanship, national consensus on issues and the offering of support in the national interest.  These are sentiments with which anyone can agree.  From my perspective, the message which must immediately be sent out to the international markets is that the Government is prepared to take decisive action and to look to the future in a way that will engender confidence among those who operate in those markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The difficulty which arises is that when people hear about the HSE, spin doctors and everything else, they become angry.  Fine Gael has tabled a Private Members' motion for this evening in which are listed nine points which were carefully drawn up and which are constructive, progressive and realistic.  Each in its turn will deal with an aspect of restoring credibility to Irish financial institutions.  The points to which I refer relate mainly to the need to change the regulatory system, to replace the senior management and executives of both major banks and the regulatory authority, to examine the way in which top executives are remunerated — we suggest that a cap of €250,000 be imposed — and the possibility of employing the good bank-bad bank concept, which Fine Gael has been advocating for some time.  These are among a number of issues in respect of which the Taoiseach could provide support in a bipartisan fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">In my view, and that of my party, the adoption of the nine points put forward in the motion will send out a signal to the international community to the effect that the Government is changing direction, is taking decisive action and is putting in place a structure that will restore the credibility of and trust and confidence in the Irish financial institutions.  In light of the Taoiseach's views on bipartisanship, support in the national interest and support for Ireland Inc. — and given the fact that I recognise the gravity of the economic situation we face and am aware that the world is running out of patience — is he prepared to accept the proposals laid down in Fine Gael's Private Members' motion?  Those proposals will be important in assisting, in part, with restoring the sense of credibility and trust that is vital to the future of our country.  Is the Taoiseach, in the spirit of bipartisanship, prepared to accept suggestions that are constructive and progressive?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_203">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_1046">In respect of the financial crisis, in recent months the Government outlined a strategy based on the need to supply a guarantee in respect of the banking system, such was the imminent threat upon it last September.  This did not meet with unanimous approval in the House.  However, it met with some approval and the Deputy's party supported that aspect of our strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">We then proceeded to ensure due diligence and a recapitalisation policy statement was issued.  We took the time with which we were provided by the guarantee to assess the best way forward in respect of a recapitalisation policy.  In that context, we were obliged to undertake discussions with the main banks concerned.  In a statement issued before Christmas, we outlined our preparedness to make significant funds available for that purpose.  On the basis of a proper risk assessment and detailed advice provided by experts employed by the Government for that purpose, we obtained the best assessment as to what the Government's commitment should be in the context of a recapitalisation of the two main banks.  We proceeded to recapitalise these banks, which did not meet with unanimous approval in the House.  I understand that when the relevant vote was taken, the recapitalisation was opposed by all of the Government's opponents in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Having carried out the recapitalisation, we stated that we would proceed to try to assess the best way to manage the risks that will emerge in the coming years.  We made it clear that this is our next step and the Minister for Finance, his advisers and the authorities under the aegis of his Department are undertaking work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">In the interim, many statements were made in the House which were inaccurate and incorrect and which made a difficult situation even worse.  We are in a battle for this country's economic stability and nobody should underestimate the scale of the challenge we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">In respect of our management of this financial issue, while it is open to all Members of the House to give their views and scrutinise Government action, as recently as last week accusations were being thrown about here that there was some ulterior motive behind Government action in this matter.  This is totally contrary to the facts and not a shred of evidence has been provided since then to substantiate these accusations, particularly the political charges that were made.  These were most unfortunate and do not go without notice elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_1052">The bottom line is that we are seeking to pursue this matter in the best way possible and in the national interest for the purpose of trying to restore financial stability to the system as soon as possible.  As I stated, this is an ongoing challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">On the economic issue, the Government has proceeded through its budgets and through raising more than €2 billion from taxation in 2009.  Further savings were made in 2008, with full year effect in 2009 and, since then, based on a framework agreed with the social partners, we have announced the need for a €2 billion saving to be identified immediately in the interest of maintaining and upholding credibility with international markets regarding the determination of the Government to seek to start to address the serious problem which has emerged in the public finances.  This did not meet with agreement in the House and continues to be opposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">From the Government's point of view, we would welcome any support that would be forthcoming from the Opposition.  However, in respect of every issue we have put to the House, not one has met with unanimous approval.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">That is a matter for the Opposition parties to determine and decide upon in their own democratic way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Furthermore, in respect of meeting the continuing challenge that faces the country in establishing and maintaining stability in our financial system and the real economic challenge that faces the country in the months and years ahead, it is important to continue to try to do this in a way that brings a national effort behind any proposals that are brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">As I stated, a framework has been agreed with the social partners.  There is much, for example, in what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has had to say, which is consistent with my approach and that of the Government.  It is an agenda which closely reflects the framework agreed between the social partners on 28 January and the Government's views that an integrated national response to the current crisis is not only desirable but essential if there is to be sufficient impetus and a coherence of approach to meet the scale of the challenge.  I remain of that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">At present, however, there is not a basis for the resumption of formal negotiations.  Obviously, the week in which we enact the legislation providing for the imposition of a pension levy is not the most conducive week for such discussions.  However, I believe everyone who is interested in the betterment of the country and meeting the challenge we face must try to ascertain if there is a way to return to these issues in a comprehensive fashion, although not specifically on the policy initiatives we have taken, which are necessary in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I remain open to discuss with the social partners the real challenges facing us in the months and years ahead.  In the meantime, the Government, as it has demonstrated, will continue to take whatever decisions we believe are necessary in the circumstances.  We look forward to those efforts.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_1060">The reaction of most people today to the news that the Garda has gone in to search the offices of Anglo Irish Bank is that it is about time.  I do not want to say any more on the issue for the reasons that have been stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The priority we all have to address, one on which we all agree, is the necessity and imperative of restoring confidence in the Irish banking and financial system.  We must also be honest, however, about what is eroding the confidence in Irish banks and the banking system.  A contributing factor has been the incremental release of information, in particular about what went on in Anglo Irish Bank.  We also have deficiencies in the regulatory set-up and the political supervision of this set-up by Government.  We know about the back-to-back arrangement between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, on which PricewaterhouseCoopers reported in October.  The Minister for Finance did not read the report at the time and did not find out about it until January when the matter was drawn to his attention.  When he found out about the arrangement he did nothing until 10 October when it became public knowledge, at which point we had a flurry of activity with the board being called in, executives resigning and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">At the weekend, a most extraordinary report, one I find hard to believe, was published in <i>The</i>
                        <i>Sunday Tribune</i>.  The newspaper has indicated it has seen transcripts to confirm its report that the financial director of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Willie McAteer, told the head of our Financial Regulatory body, Mr. Neary, at a meeting in September that the bank would be “managing” its balance sheet, in other words, cooking its books.  According to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, Mr. Neary responded with the words, “Fair play to you, Willie.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The Sunday Tribune report also states that staff in the Office of the Financial Regulator were informed in a telephone call from officials of Anglo Irish Bank in October, made after the guarantee was put in place, that the bank was manipulating its balance sheet and the balance sheet did not represent a real number.  The newspaper also reports that a senior civil servant, who is described as working closely with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, assured Irish Life &amp; Permanent that he understood why it was necessary to carry out the back-to-back transactions and that there was no need for concern over these arrangements.  Has the Taoiseach checked if these stories are true?  Has he asked the Minister for Finance about them?  What can he tell the House about them?</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">I agree with the Taoiseach that we have to restore confidence in Irish banks.  Part of the process of restoring confidence in Irish banks, particularly Anglo Irish Bank, is to identify if wrongdoing took place and, if so, to have it dealt with.  Another part of the process is to restore some confidence in the regulation of Irish banks.  I would like to know if the story which appeared on Sunday is accurate and what steps the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance have taken to check if it is true.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_209">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_1065">I will make a general point and then answer the specific questions raised.  As everyone knows, a thorough investigation is taking place in Anglo Irish Bank and certain matters which have come to the attention of the authorities are being investigated.  People will be aware, therefore, that the meeting referred to in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>article did not take place until 22 January 2009, that is, after the Government’s decision on the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  It seems from the newspaper accounts that this is an allegation based on a newspaper’s interpretation of a document that is at least a third hand account of impressions of persons who were supposed to have attended the meeting in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The Department of Finance has no role in approving transactions of this kind between banks, much less four months after the fact.  When the Department became aware in October, as a result of the initial PwC report on Anglo Irish Bank, that such transactions did exist the matter was immediately drawn to the attention of the Financial Regulator.  The simple point I am making is that there are interested persons seeking retrospective approval on matters which were not given the <i>imprimatur </i>by the Department of Finance in any shape or form.  I am satisfied of that, knowing the official concerned.  Therefore, any effort to deal with this matter other than through the proper investigative channels — based on surmise, interpretation, recollection, or the post-dated memo of 22 January which mentioned something that was alleged to have happened in September — will not be useful.  I did not attend the meeting in question; nor do I know of anybody who attended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">Let the investigators deal with the matter, because that is the only way we will get to the truth.  It is important that any information that becomes available in the public domain be seen in that context.  The only way in which this House can proceed — indeed, the only way in which the law can be pursued — is through the investigative arrangements set down by Acts of the Oireachtas.  Every aspect of this matter will be investigated by the people concerned, independently and statutorily, and the true facts will be brought out.  I cannot add to that.</p>

As I do not want to be adversarial about this, I invite the Taoiseach, with due respect to the answer he has given, to try to answer my questions a second time.  The issue in respect of the senior civil servant at the Department of Finance is not whether or not the Department of Finance gave approval to the arrangements between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent.  It is accepted that it did not approve or give, as the Taoiseach said, an <i>imprimatur</i> to it.  The question is whether it gave the nod to it.  That is what I want the Taoiseach to address.  That is important.</p>

However, has the Taoiseach made any inquiries about the regulator being told in September — and, apparently, his office being told again in October — that Anglo Irish Bank was, in effect, managing its balance sheet, and that it was given the nod for that?  This is a case not of light regulation but of blind-eye regulation.  The reputation of the country and of our banks, and all the economic consequences that flow from that, are at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">What went on in Anglo Irish Bank must be investigated.  The Labour Party has been seeking this for some time and I am glad to see progress being made on it.

          <p eId="para_1081">I take the point that has been made.  These transactions, as I said, took place at the end of September last year.  The meeting referred to in the article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> did not take place until 22 January 2009.  I am simply making the point that the Department of Finance official concerned had not been briefed on any discussion that may have taken place with the Financial Regulator on the matter and was not in a position to comment on that discussion, and the official concerned gave no <i>imprimatur</i> whatsoever to those transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The position of the Financial Regulator is that it did not give authority to a transaction that would constitute a wrongdoing or would not be in compliance with the Central Bank Acts or the companies legislation.  Regardless of what motivation there might be for putting across such a view — it should be kept in mind that this was four months after the fact in a memo dated after the decision on nationalisation of the bank — in respect of people looking back to see whether they could find retrospective approval for any such thing, the investigator is the only person who can come to a conclusion on the matter.  The authorities would not agree with the interpretation being put on the reference to the memo dated 22 January, which is an important date when one takes into account that we are now looking back in the aftermath of a due diligence process that had taken place prior to that date and the decision taken by Government to nationalise the bank in the interest of maintaining financial stability in the country and of making sure that a bank of systemic importance did not fail.  I am putting it no further than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">I am as constrained in the matter as Deputy Gilmore but I am simply making those points as they are the reason we should be cautious in accepting the veracity of any such interpretations, given the interests of various parties, if I am making myself clear.<b> </b> Furthermore, I regard the official concerned, whom I know and with whom I have worked in the past, as a person of the highest integrity.  I have no reason to believe that the Office of the Financial Regulator was not also seeking to discharge its duties conscientiously.</p>

The proposal will permit a maximum of two speaking places for Labour Party Members, most of whom would like to contribute to the debate on Second Stage.  That will not be possible under the proposed arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">In the context of all that is happening today and in the lead-up to today's events outside this House, an opportunity should be provided by the Government to raise questions on recent developments.  Members have questions to ask regarding Anglo Irish Bank, which is now in State ownership, but there is no provision for such questions on the Order Paper.  Serious questions arise, some of which I touched on during Leaders' Questions, in regard to the role of former directors of Anglo Irish Bank continuing to serve on State bodies.  Issues also arise regarding the ongoing Garda search of the business premises of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_1103">There is a clear need to improve the position of the public finances as a matter of urgency.  The proposed pension related levy is necessary to help restore balance.  It is the first of a series of measures that will have to be taken in our effort to ensure our economic survival and ability to compete.  There is no doubt that it represents an imposition but the public service pay and pensions bill comprises more than one third of all public expenditure.  There is simply no alternative to making savings in this area and we believe the fairest way to do so is the arrangement whereby those who earn most pay most.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The big problem we face is increased joblessness.  People are losing their jobs in this recession, which is exacerbated by other problems such as difficult trading conditions in the UK.  Many workers are losing their jobs altogether and some of them have private pension provisions which are being considerably reduced as a result of the pensions crisis.  This is one aspect, although it is not the only response of the Government.  The scale and magnitude of the problem is far greater than even this imposition could seek to address.  I ask that the urgency of the situation be recognised by everyone so that we can send the right signal to international markets about our determination to put the public finances in order.  This is the first, necessary, step in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1388">I have already spoken at length on the delays in the farming grant.  The Minister's and Government's decision in that respect is completely unjust and unfair.  When the Minister for Finance spoke on this Bill he gave only two lines in a 12-page speech to the issue of farming which gives some idea of his thinking regarding the serious farming crisis.  I will leave further comment on that issue to my colleague, Deputy Creed, except to say that banks are putting heavy pressure on farmers.  It is clear that if the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has met senior bankers he has not succeeded in spreading the message to the staff in local branches because they are sending out letters seeking urgent decisions on the repayment of the money used for farm buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">I want to comment briefly on the early child care support that has been removed by the Government.  The support in question makes a significant difference to families, particularly if both parents have lost their jobs and no longer have incomes.  It is a useful benefit for those in work who need to pay for child care.  The thing that annoys parents the most is the Government's failure to try to close a loophole in the system whereby money leaves this country to support children in other countries.  It is completely unfair that people who are living here can claim the early child care support on behalf of children who live in other countries.  It is time that aspect of the system was stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">The pension levy is unfair.  Last August or September, at a time when the Taoiseach was on his holidays and completely ignoring the situation, my party stated that there was a need to curtail some aspects of Government output.  The imposition of the pension levy on people who earn less than €15,000 is a complete joke.  There is no point in Government Deputies talking about fairness or equity, because they are not evident in this proposal.  The levy is to be imposed across the board, regardless of the circumstances of the family of any civil servant.  That needs to be changed before we vote on this Bill for the last time tomorrow night.  It is hard to tell people who are earning €15,000, or even €30,000, that it is in the country's interest for them to pay this levy.  When one considers that the former Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her husband, who is a former chairman of FÁS, went on a junket to the United States at a cost of €150,000, one has to ask where this country is going.  One can ask people to do things that are good and correct if one is acting in such a matter, but it is not acceptable to ask somebody to take the brunt of a cutback of this nature while one continues to live the high life.  We all know what kind of job the Financial Regulator did, but he was given a golden handshake of €630,000 nonetheless.  In such circumstances, one has to ask many questions.</p>

I do not think we have reached the bottom of the pit yet.  People outside this House have not yet recognised the gravity of the situation we are in.  I believe the Government will be obliged to introduce a new budget in the not too distant future.  The public finances are unravelling at such a pace that a new budget, with tax-raising measures at its centre, is inevitable.  The most regrettable thing about all of this is that no cohesive plan is emerging from the Government benches.  The Government is not willing to adopt a bipartisan approach to solving this problem.  The Government's "we know best" approach is not serving the nation at this critical time in its economic history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">It is not sustainable to borrow €55 million a day as we are doing at the moment.  I wish to make it clear, before I move on to the parts of this legislation that relate to the agriculture industry, that Fine Gael will oppose this Bill on Second Stage because we do not believe it represents the comprehensive panacea that is required.  While there is a price worth paying for the security that comes with public service employment, it is indefensible that the proposed public service levy is disproportionately skewed against lower-paid workers in the public service.  As I have said in previous debates, the political classes in this House have to lead by example.  If the Taoiseach had made a commitment, in the first instance, to start leading by example in this House, he would have gone some way towards addressing the problem.  The current position is untenable.  We need to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">I assure anybody who is not familiar with the problems in the farm waste management scheme that the point I would like to make in respect of the scheme does not represent special pleading.  Farmers had to invest in waste management systems to enable them to stay in business.  The systems do not generate any additional income for them.  In fact, farmers are exposed to a liability as they will have to pay for the balance of the works over a number of years.  Deputies who are involved in the business or farming communities outside this House will be familiar with the well-established principle to the effect that if one pays one's taxes late, one will have to pay penalties and interest.  The same principle should apply to the State in respect of the contract into which it freely entered with farmers throughout the country who had obligations under the farm waste management scheme.  Some 17,400 farmers were run up a chute when they were told they had to complete works under the scheme by 31 December last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">I do not know where to start when highlighting the debacle that was the handling of this issue by the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  If the Minister had accepted the thrust of the Private Member's motion on this issue that was proposed by Fine Gael last November, he would have extended the deadline and allowed farmers to complete these works throughout 2009.  He could have made it clear to farmers that payments would be staggered if works were completed in 2009.  It is entirely unacceptable to pull the rug from under farmers after they have organised finance with their banks and completed their works.  That is what the Government is doing, in effect, by providing for staggered payments over three years without proposing to cover interest payments.  It is entirely unacceptable, as I have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">This House introduced the prompt payments legislation, with much fanfare, some years ago.  It provides an example of how the State should do its business.  Under the legislation, the State is obliged to pay its customers within 30 days.  If I recall correctly, the charter of farmers' rights requires payments to be made within eight weeks.  It is entirely unacceptable that such contracts are being unilaterally torn up by one partner to them.  The Government would not get away with it if it were not for this legislation, which is a signal of the weakness of a Government that is trying to weasel out of contracts into which it freely entered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">I will propose two amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  The first amendment will require the State to cover the interest liability that will accrue to farmers while they await full payment.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, and his Government backbenchers will support that amendment.  In the current climate, the cashflow problems of farmers are exacerbated by other problems in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I refer to problems with the refund of VAT that is due on certain works, for example.  There are delays in getting documentation back.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">A range of problems is associated with farm waste management.  The Department can share the blame for the collapse in the dairy sector, which has been caused by the failure to invoke adequate market support measures.  The House does not need to be reminded of the pork dioxin crisis.  The agriculture sector is an engine that can contribute to the revitalisation of this country's economy.  It needs to be recognised as an indigenous industry in which people work hard to create employment in their own farms, while sustaining thousands of off-farm jobs.  In addition to our first amendment, which will deal with interest payments, we will propose a second amendment to provide for the payment in two instalments, of 40% and 60%, of the liability associated with the farm waste management scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">As the Minister for Finance is not here, I would like to ask the Minister of State a specific question.  Some 17,400 farmers are involved in this scheme.  If one works on the basis of an average payment of €33,000, the liability can be estimated to be approximately €575 million.  Some €125 million has been provided in the budget of the Department.  It is proposed to pay 40% of the liability in 2009.  I estimate that 40% of the total liability is €230 million.  I want clear answers.  I do not want to tell farmers in a week or two weeks' time that it is proposed to pay 20%, rather than 40%.  Where will the Government make up the shortfall for the €125 million provided for in its estimate, and the €230 million that is required to make a 40% payment in 2009?</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">The Government's mathematics simply do not add up.  Its mathematical failings led us into this debacle the first day.  Anybody with any understanding of that scheme would not attempt to hide behind a claim that they miscalculated because they did not expect as many farmers to be involved.  It was widely known that the Government's liability was going to be in the region of €500 million, yet it failed to provide adequately for even 40%.  I would like clarity on that issue.  I also invite the Minister of State's colleagues on the backbenches to support the issue of interest payments on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1401">The sad part of this Bill is that we have to have it at all.  It is also sad that it has taken so long for the message to sink in and for the Government to recognise that there was a problem.  We now have fire brigade legislation that is attempting to deal with issues that were not dealt with over the past six or seven years.  The public are now being hammered and must take a punishment beating for the inadequacies of the Government, for the inadequacies of the legislation that was in place, for the non-existence of regulation and for the non-observance of rules and regulations put in place during the DIRT inquiry.  I cannot understand how the country is being held to ransom in this fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">We hear appeals for patriotism from the other side of the House and for people to put up their hands and accept some of the blame for what has gone wrong.  What in God's name is this place coming to?  Surely the power and the responsibility rest with the Government.  Accountability for the actions of the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank also rests with the Government.  All these bodies report to the Government, so what was going on?  We heard lectures over the weekend that the Opposition should tone things down, as they are causing a disturbance and upsetting the equilibrium of the Government.  This is a load of rubbish.  Where have the Government Deputies been?  What have they been doing?  Do they not understand what they have done to the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">The first hit has been on the public service, which is to blame for all this.  The public service is taking the punishment beating in the first instance.  Did the public servants not do what they were told by the Government?  Were they not working in accordance with the instructions of the Government?  Have they not observed the rules to the letter?  Were they not given benchmarking by the Government?  Did the Government not recognise their existence?  Did it not recognise the importance of having more public servants?  For example, the health service contains an extra 33,000 public servants.  Are these people not working in accordance with Government policy?</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">How is this proposal intended to affect the competitiveness of this economy?  How does this affect the price of our goods and services as we sell them abroad?  Have we not listened to lectures from the Government over the past few years stating that we would no longer be able to compete in the manufacturing sector and the services sector, and that we now had to look for high technology jobs?  Is the Government now recognising that we must go back to the old reliables?  Where now is the much vaunted high-wage economy?  Where is the richest country in the world?  Now that there have been two elections fought on the basis that we were the richest country in the world, what has happened since?</p>
          <p eId="para_1405">Have the Ministers of State on that side of the House looked into their hearts and asked whether they know everything they should know about these issues?</p>

They did not know that when they came into the House on 29 September and they have not known it at any time since.  More information unfolds from the system as each day goes by.  Is the Government capable of extrapolating the information necessary at this vital time for the stability of the economy and finances of this nation?  I do not think it is.  In such circumstances, the Ministers of State across the floor have a duty to themselves and to the country to stand up and be counted.  That applies to all Ministers and Ministers of State, including the invisible Ministers who only come in here when it suits them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">Before it is too late, will the Government please come clean with the full extent of the problem that now faces this country?  We should not be drip fed with information, as has occurred in the past three months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1411">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the economic crisis to which this Bill is addressed.  The people are anxious that we would be positive.  We should know the character of that which has failed and brought us to this position, and be able to look at real options for constructing an alternative that would impact on their lives.  Those most concerned are those who have already lost their jobs in the private sector, those whose jobs are threatened in both the private and public sector, and those who are now facing a reduction in meagre incomes as a result of this Bill, which will significantly reduce their capacity to participate in society, affect the opportunities available to their children, and affect their lives in the most basic areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412">Language is incredibly important, as it can mislead people or be of help to them.  When we speak of solidarity, it is important to ask — solidarity with whom?  The solidarity we need is that which would be at the root of a kind of citizenship that would see the economy accountable to political principles that are ethical in themselves.  That version of solidarity is entirely different from the kind of solidarity that is present within the Irish business class.  What do I mean by this?  When one looks at the former directors of Anglo Irish Bank and the directors of other banks, as well as the members of boards right across the corporate sector in Ireland, one would see what we would call in the social sciences "a very dense network".  It is where the chief executive of one body becomes the chairman of another body, and as the chairman vacates the chair, he becomes the member of the board of yet another company.  The members of that circle have demonstrated significant solidarity with themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">It is shameful that the Government refuses to do what is necessary if we are to have public respect and a restoration of trust.  If we are to reduce the size of the debt which we are paying in international interest payments, we need objectively to deal with breaches of the law and breaches of governance.  Of equal importance is the need to send a symbolic message to state that the old circle is being put out of business and that a new kind of solidarity based on responsible citizenship — a genuine republicanism — is being put in its place.  However, we do not see any suggestion that there will be such a sweep across the boards of institutions that have done such damage to Ireland and its future.  We see little evidence that this will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">Being positive, I want to suggest it is a time for new ideas.  Why is the Government unable to admit that the suggestion of regulation with a light touch was a disastrous tragedy which brought us into disrepute?  Why is it unable to say that the worst Minister for Finance, former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, who is now a Commissioner and is regarded in Europe as a disastrous product of the neoliberal school of economics, has given it a poisoned chalice with his notion of regulation with a light touch?  He has damaged the Office of the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the reputation of this country.  The bill is being passed on to some of those who have the least capacity to pay.  Will the consequences of Commissioner McCreevy's actions be carried by those who benefited under the so-called Celtic tiger?  Will landlords with endless properties who are getting rental interest relief pay?  No.  Will the people at the top of the banking tree who have an unlimited capacity to purchase additional pension rights pay?  No.  Will those who have gained benefits from private hospitals on public hospital ground pay?  No.  Will middle-level public servants pay?  Yes.  Why is this so?  This is very interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">I want to mention one of the most shameful things regarding solidarity because it is very important.  When I speak about the banks I refer to those at the top of the tree.  I find it somewhat cynical that those who chaired the boards of banks can write in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about the lean, flexible economy we need to create.  It is very sad that ordinary people who work at lower levels in the banks sometimes encounter the opprobrium of members of the public.  That is wrong because these people were recruited during that neoliberal period that drove down wages.  Tellers at the counters of banks are not responsible for those who gave them low wages and little security, and who greased their own tills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">In the public service many people are taking the brunt of what has been directed at them, and this is very important.  People tell them that because they have a meagre pension they are to be put into tension and conflict with the unemployed in the private sector.  This is another scandalous suggestion, cynical and disgraceful in its manipulation.  During the 2008 benchmarking most of the public servants who will pay the levy, those in the middle ranks, had their pensions judged to be worth 12.5%.  They paid 6.5% on that and then the 1% levy.  Now they will pay another levy.  The suggestion was put around that because they had a pension of any kind they were the enemies of the private sector and, worse, that they were not contributing to their pensions.  It was a disgraceful lie perpetrated and, sometimes, whipped up by the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">I am a long time in politics and know moral cowardice when I see it.  Let those who are asking people to wear sackcloth and ashes have the courage to say who should wear the sackcloth and who should have the ashes.  Are they talking about all those who work in banks?  Why have they not the courage to name the people they know well, whom they invited to their seminars and to whom they would look for philanthropy?  On the other side when they speak of the politicians they are afraid to name those who subscribed to the neoliberal model, were in favour of regulation with a light touch and went on to bring this message from Ireland to Europe.  This is the lazy and cowardly way to save the politicians and bankers and instead to drag down all politicians and the person with the most menial position in a bank.  Shame on them for their lack of courage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">We can examine what is happening in all the European countries as they respond to something undeniable.  Here I agree with members of the Government.  There is an international credit crisis, however within that there is a home-grown Irish crisis, namely the property bubble that was created in Ireland.  From 2006 it was perfectly clear that we were receiving an inordinate amount of property-related revenue.  We were looking on.  People can suggest why that is.  The Governor of the Central Bank suggests his job relates to the solvency of the banking system so he accepts what they say to him.  The Financial Regulator accepts the auditors of the banks and the Department of Finance accepts the legal opinion offered to the delinquent banks.  This is lovely and very decorous, but totally insufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">This comes from something that has been developed through the second half of the 1980s to the present.  People opposed the role of the State, but what are these people doing now?  They are turning to the State and using it to take out of ordinary people's pockets money that will prop up a failed and unaccountable banking system.  What happened when we wanted the State to invest in schools and infrastructure and be involved in industry?  They said we must keep the State out and favour regulation with a light touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">The old gang is still there.  If we are to move forward we must objectively make changes and send a symbolic message that we have cleared out the stables and that they are disqualified from boards in which the Irish Government will have a significant shareholding.  We would support such moves by the Government and moves on job creation.  We would fully support the Government if it suggested it would have not just a bord snip but a board that would examine every obstacle to retraining, returning to education or getting a caring occupation regarded as a full job and every delay in redundancy payments.  However, to get to the point of creating jobs in the green and social economies and to return to the traded economy that is producing and exporting we need to get the banking chaos out of the way.  We cannot do that on a drip, drip basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">That is why the Labour Party has suggested eight principles to deal with banking, including the establishment of a banking commission.  Those eight principles exist objectively and the international community can see them.  This year we are paying €4.5 billion interest on the national debt and we spend €55 million per day to run the country.  We will spend 25% of all our tax on interest and we are borrowing at 2.5% over the prime German rate precisely because of the poisonous circle that brought Anglo Irish Bank and us to where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">This is the kind of immunity they desire.  They sit on other boards and are the admired class.  They are the people who change one from the other.  People even appoint them to State and semi-State boards.  It is a time for a new politics and a different connection between economy and politics.  It is time for ethics and transparency.  It is time to end that old, poisonous circle, and to tell the world we are ending it and that we are part of a new kind of thinking that has the best of intellectual work in economics, talking about the social economy, a connection between ethics, society, politics and economy.  That means it is the end of the old neo-liberal myth.  It is time for Charlie McCreevy to go away and repent, not come back here.  He has left a deadly legacy and those who try to prop it up are no friends of Ireland as we try to come out of this crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1423">There is not a person reaching maturity in Ireland who is not terribly worried about the situation in which we find ourselves, and that is as it should be.  We really do not know how or when we will come out of this, but we know what brought us here and it is important that we analyse that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424">Recently I visited another country in severe weather.  That country did not stop and I envied its transport and health systems.  This is a country at which, I suppose, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and I would look at and say thank God it has joined the European Union because that will bring it on and it will benefit in the same way as Ireland.  That country had better transport, health and education systems than Ireland, and it had a better social and moral fibre, yet it is a country which we looked on as being not as developed as Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">The question we need to ask ourselves, which everyone is asking and which the Labour Party has been trying to get the Government to answer for a number of years, is what we did with the money generated during the boom.  What we did with that money is what brings us to this point.  We gave away that boom money and had a party, which brings us to Charlie McCreevy.  We encouraged people, by way of tax reductions and incentives, to drive on an economy that was based on one single aspect.  We did not put in place a good transport system and no matter what money we threw at our health service, we did not improve it.  God help us with our education system, which is worse than it has been in the past 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">When the economy took a downturn, what did we do?  First, we attacked the elderly, the very people who had ensured we had the wherewithal to have a boom in the first place, but we rowed back on that.  Next we attacked people with a disability.  We decided that they would no longer be entitled to the disability allowance at 16 and would have to wait until they were aged 18, but we rowed back on that.  The next target was children with special needs in school, but we have not rowed back on that.  Those children, the ones who need the type of expertise we can provide to ensure they have some quality of life in the future, must now survive in classes bigger than we originally intended — 27 on average — with no special needs class.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Our next target is the public service and the Civil Service.  No one in this country does not realise that we must do something because we are in serious trouble.  However, what these people say, and what we agree with, is that it is deeply unfair.  It is the unfairness of scapegoating one sector in society that creates the anger.  The attacks on the Civil Service and the public service did not begin in the newspapers.  They began with politicians demanding that they be brought to heel as if in some way they had run riot in the country when we all know that is not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">We need to take hold of what is happening in this country.  The Government, still deeply affected by the influence of the Progressive Democrats, who, I remember well, insisted on light-touch regulation and lower rates of tax and also insisted that we privatise our health service, must take hold of the situation and deal with it in an equitable fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">I think it was Abraham Lincoln who stated that there are only two certainties in life, death and taxes.  There is only one equal system that should apply, which is taxation.  With taxation comes all of the protections.  One cannot tax people on low incomes, because they are outside the net, while people who are in the system have protection regarding health expenses, if they can claim them back, and mortgage relief.  It is the unfairness of what the Government is doing that creates the anger.  This country — it has done it before on several occasions — is prepared to accept pain and that every one of us must put our backs to the wheel, but there is only one mechanism to do so, which is fair taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">Another matter has brought us to this point.  I heard the exact same arguments ten years ago about the employment of women as I hear now about appointments to boards, that there simply were not enough qualified candidates.  That is utter rubbish.  It was a little golden circle.  When government becomes that involved and embedded in industry, and when it becomes part and parcel of the golden circle, then there can be no result other than what we see today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">We need the Government to start clearing out those boards and people to start having trust in them.  One would not trust a bank that did what these people have done with the few bob one saved all one's life on which one must rely as a pension, and one is quite right not to trust them.  Share prices dropped again today.  This is because, basically, the markets do not believe what the Government is saying.  The boards should be cleared out.  There are enough talented people out there in the world who could take those positions.  It is not rocket science.  Given the salaries they were paying themselves, applicants will be queuing up at the door.</p>

          <p eId="para_1443">The justification for this Bill is strict necessity.  Due to a catastrophic fall in revenues, we have moved from a comfortable surplus position or near balance in the Government's accounts over a long period to a situation where this year we will be borrowing €18 billion or 9.5% of GDP, which is over three times the limit allowed for a member of the eurozone.  We first of all must contain what has been a spiralling deficit and then take further steps to reduce it, without killing off the economy in the process.  If we take a lesson from recent history, 20 years ago we started the process of national recovery by putting the national finances straight, alongside accompanying development measures.  We will not achieve recovery unless we address that hole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">We are often inclined to exaggerate the outside world's interest in our domestic dramas, scandals, and follies.  This time, however, there can be no doubt about the keen attention abroad being paid to potentially vulnerable eurozone economies, including ours, all the more so perhaps because of the star rating accorded to us up to the recent past.  The question being asked is whether the Government in particular, and the political system in general, are capable of handling the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">If we were to withdraw this Bill or vote it down, as many are demanding, we would risk such an erosion of confidence that our economic destiny, for the first time since independence in 1922, very likely would be taken out of our hands.  We would face as a condition of the emergency support we would then require, whether from inside the eurozone or outside, demands for far more drastic medicine, which would quite possibly make present complaints about fairness and equity seem like a storm in a teacup. Those of us who work in more protected areas of the economy and who find it difficult to accept that we now find ourselves in a completely changed situation need to wake up fast.</p>

          <p eId="para_1447">Ireland in current circumstances can no longer afford the present pay bill for the non-commercial public sector, a sector which has grown by more than 100,000 people since 1997.  There are only two choices: substantial redundancies or across the board net reductions in pay.  In many other countries without a social partnership culture, when there are economic difficulties, public servants are simply let go.  Twenty years ago, we adopted a fairly expensive voluntary redundancy scheme.  Social partnership began as a response to times that were also very difficult.  It served the country well for 22 years, both when restraint and co-operation in crisis management were needed, and through the better times.  An unprecedented situation like the present, when not merely a wage increase deferral but net reductions in pay, however arrived at, are called for, was never envisaged.  I fully understand the difficulty trade union members have in accepting that and I respect their protests.  They have to do what they have to do, but so must the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448">There is a widespread conception about the relationship between public representatives and their more organised constituents, which suggests that Deputies, Senators and councillors are political invertebrates, and that all that is needed to pull them into line is to suggest sufficiently strongly and preferably in numbers that a certain course of action or persistence in it will lead to votes being won or lost.  Personally, I always find that one of the least persuasive arguments, not taking kindly to being either bribed or threatened.  While most of us will seek re-election, what we do and intend to do while we are here is more important. Perhaps it is time to re-read Edmund Burke's letter to his constituents.</p>

          <p eId="para_1457">There is much talk of a need for leadership, as if leadership would be something popular.  This Bill, following the failure of the social partnership negotiations, is an act of leadership by the Taoiseach and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">Obviously, the Opposition parties do not want Government leadership.  They want to lead themselves, doing their best to disguise what they would have to do in government beforehand, as we will all have to go far beyond what has so far been decided up to today.  Would they rescind this Bill once enacted, or do more than tweak it, as the Taoiseach is willing to do? I doubt it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">The Labour Party is reverting to its roots, as the parliamentary mouthpiece of the trade union movement.  I remember, although I do not have the exact quotation, Deputy Ruairí Quinn admitting in a moment of candour about the Fine-Gael-Labour Coalition Government of 1982-87, of which he was a prominent member, that what it had done had helped to prop up public services and employment.  We had at that time a low expectations economy with no more than two thirds of the average EC income per head, half the employment we have today and enterprise suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">Today, we must be more ambitious.  There can be no question of just imposing higher taxes on the wider community to prop up a level of State-supported jobs, incomes and pension entitlements that is no longer affordable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1464">I detest Thatcherism and have almost as much distaste for neo-liberalism as Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465">Leadership is about spelling out those facts clearly, and about maintaining an iron resolve to face up to the problems facing our country and finding the necessary solutions, of which this can be only one instalment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">The major change in our circumstances, to which we have to adjust, is our membership of the eurozone.  Its advantages are that we are no longer exposed as a small country to currency speculation or exorbitant interest rates, and of course it has immense convenience.  The downside is that uncompetitiveness and excessive income levels cannot be levelled out by devaluation disguised by domestic inflation.  What is required is that we accept income reductions.  The market will face this to a considerable extent in the unprotected sector, but the public sector has to take corresponding action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">When benchmarking was introduced, it was designed to achieve two things, namely, to match the perceived rapid increase in rewards in the private sector and to eliminate industrial disputes based on rigid relativities.  The era of social partnership has brought about a highly beneficial improvement in industrial peace, with the number of disputes and days lost reduced to negligible levels compared to earlier decades.  Benchmarking was confined to the public sector and created, as we are well aware, considerable resentment in the private sector.  The second exercise was largely neutral and made very few changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">What is taking place at the moment, and what is contained in this Bill, is in effect benchmarking in reverse, a rebalancing exercise. It recognises that on a cost-benefit basis public sector pensions are on average worth a great deal more at the present time than the average private pension.  The pension levy, though unpopular, is an attempt to establish greater fairness across different sectors of the economy, but is above all designed as the least unacceptable way to relieve what has become an unsustainable level of Government expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">Historically, many measures, including income tax, have been introduced on the falsely optimistic understanding that they were temporary.  The Minister for Finance has correctly given no such assurance in relation to the pension levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470">Any unexpected fall in living standards is likely to put most people under considerable or even great financial pressure.  Few of us have uncommitted income and are debt free.  Reducing outgoings is difficult and painful, and the <i>cri de coeur </i>coming from people at this time is overwhelmingly genuine.  Unfortunately, as a country and as a society, we have little choice in the matter, although I note with satisfaction the comment from Age Action that the elderly are least affected by these measures.</p>

          <p eId="para_1472">The search for people to blame is in full swing, but we should guard against too simplistic an analysis.  While imprudent actions, or worse, at home have certainly greatly exacerbated the situation, the budgetary difficulties and loss of competitiveness we are facing are not caused solely by a few bankers and developers.  Making them pay for their mistakes may help assuage public feelings, but will not fill the holes in the dyke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1473">We need a perspective on what has happened so suddenly and why, apart from the obvious global diversion.  We are never going to abolish the economic cycle.  While political leaders worldwide promise from time to time to abolish the stop-go, boom-bust and to bring about sustainable growth, implying that it is possible to continue onward and upward, I disagree.  I do not believe we will ever again in this country view a tearaway growth that we never experienced before as an unalloyed blessing, where in fact it carries with it the seeds of threat.  In biblical Egypt, there were seven fat years and seven lean ones.  Every farmer knows to save fodder for the winter.  We are fortunate here that the much maligned former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and his successor, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, put aside surpluses into the national pension reserve fund, which thankfully has given us some of the money we so badly need to cope with the banking crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1479">When nearly everyone to a greater or lesser degree was doing better than previously — in many cases, a lot better — there was less general concern that a few were making astronomical gains.  A harsh spotlight has now fallen on inflated salaries and pensions in a number of sectors, as well as on many of the wealthiest in our society, who simply opt out of tax residence here altogether and choose for themselves what they support as good causes.  Worldwide, amongst OECD countries, there is less and less tolerance for the bank secrecy that allows evasion and for tax havens which do not comply with international codes of practice.  Ireland is a good citizen in this respect and a sharp distinction must be drawn between tax competition and tax havens.  Such issues require collective international action that will not harm the interests of individual countries that have much less clout than, say, the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">Moral discourse here has far too often been narrowly focused, even stunted.  The public good and the need to live up to ethical standards have too often been ignored or circumvented.</p>

          <p eId="para_1484">Much of the initial anger of the French revolution was directed at financiers and speculators.  Today, strictly within the rule of law, those who have brought disaster on what would once have been regarded as the ultimate in sound institutions, the bankers, must face the consequences.  Whether legally or morally, they have a liability for the debts they have incurred, which must not be heaped on the taxpayer to clear up, while they go off and enjoy extravagant lifestyles in the Caribbean or some other warm foreign climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485">From now on, people will be judged by the extent to which they are prepared to pull their full weight, to give example and, where necessary, to forego personal advantages.  The effort of everyone is needed.  Public service is and should be a high calling, adequately remunerated but without exploiting the capacity of the taxpayer, which may fall as well as rise, as if it were virtually infinite.</p>

          <p eId="para_1489">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide for the payment of a contribution by persons in the public service, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and certain other office holders, who are members of an occupational pension scheme or a pension arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">As regards today's investigation on Anglo Irish Bank, like everybody else in the House, I am angry with the behaviour of senior bankers.  There clearly was a small, cosy group of business people who felt that regulation was for little people.  They felt they were untouchable and if the global financial meltdown had not occurred, they could well still be untouchable.  Today's action by the Garda Síochána and the ODCE is welcome but it is and must remain a matter for them.  I hope this will be the first step in restoring the trust that ordinary people have lost in the banks and also, it must be said, in the political system.  We must allow this investigation to take its course.  It would be easy to hit out and name everybody we believe is guilty of these banking crimes.  We would feel much better if we were able to name and shame everybody, but it would not necessarily mean that justice would be brought to those who deserve it.  These bankers lost their moral compass, but we must not say anything that will let them get away with their crimes.  While these issues are linked, the most important issues are jobs and financial stability.  This Bill is one step in bringing that stability back to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491">The levy will be difficult for everybody to swallow, but it is the least unacceptable form of levy.  There has been resistance to the Bill since it was first proposed but implementing tough decisions is rarely popular or easy to do.  It is the Government's job to make those difficult choices in the best interests of the country and the economy, regardless of polls.  As politicians, we are always cognisant of public opinion but it is important that these decisions are taken without keeping one eye on opinion polls.  It has got to that stage.  We would neglect our jobs as public representatives if we were to pay too much attention to polls at the expense of making tough decisions, albeit the right ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492">Ireland is facing hitherto unseen economic challenges on an unprecedented scale.  We have had difficult times in the past but things have never gone from boom to bust at this speed.  It is normal for politicians to try to score political points but it has gone beyond that now.  Some people are calling for an election but that would only paralyse the country at a time when every day is important and our reputation within global financial markets must be restored as a matter of urgency.  An election would only paralyse the political system and do untold damage to domestic financial markets.  The easy option is to call for an election but it would do more harm than good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">As with every other TD, my office has been inundated with calls and e-mails about this levy from concerned civil and public servants.  I fully appreciate the challenges the levy places on individuals and families, but it is in everyone's interest that we should deal with this issue responsibly given the problems we face.  We must not skirt around the difficulties and there can be no escaping the facts, regardless of how unpalatable they may be.  We are in the midst of a global recession whose effects are being felt in every developed country.  Ireland operates an open market which, in general, has been positive for us over the past 20 years.  It has, however, left us exposed in the current international downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">This, coupled with the decline in the construction industry, has meant the economy has deteriorated at a faster rate than anyone could have predicted.  The State will have to borrow €18 billion this year at steeper interest rates to finance current and capital spending.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, this equates to borrowing €4,500 for every man, woman and child in the State.  The current rate of spending simply cannot continue and savings must be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">The steps the Government is taking is about protecting jobs and assisting small and medium-sized enterprises that generate employment.  They are the risk-takers, create jobs and give stability to society.  Bringing down costs is a matter of urgency.  Costs across the board must come down by at least 30% to 40%, if we are to be able to compete in a globalised economy.  Yes, the pension levy will be difficult for people.  However, it is only the first step and there will be significantly greater pain to come for all sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">Some union officials seem to recognise this but others are using out-dated political rhetoric.  They need to grasp an understanding of the difficulties the country is facing.  Some of them are still reading Karl Marx and using his doctrine.  Until now, the private sector has borne the brunt of the economic downturn.  In January, 1,000 people a day lost their jobs in the private sector.  To claim the public sector is being targeted unfairly is not the case.  Workers in the private sector are paying with their jobs.  The decision to implement a pensions-related deduction is not easy but it is deemed the most fair and equitable solution.  Public servants enjoy significantly better pensions than the majority of workers in the private sector.  The benefits are higher and, more importantly, they are secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">It has been claimed the wealthiest in society are not being asked to contribute their share.  In fact, the lowest paid are protected and those on higher incomes contribute most.  Currently, 38% of the entire workforce pays no tax at all.  It should be noted that 6% of the wealthiest in the workforce pay 50% of all our taxes.  Everyone in a position to help must do so.  This levy applies to the salaries of all Deputies and Ministers, who have also taken a 10% pay cut already.  Other measures will have to be introduced.  Those who have more money will have to pay more.  The higher tax band will be increased and I would not be surprised if the increase was to be 8%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">If another solution that could deliver the same savings were proposed, it would be considered.  Some union leaders, however, are not interested in solutions but rhetoric.  The Bill's proposals must be implemented for the good of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1499">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue facing the country.  The introduction of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill is the first step on a long road that lies ahead of us.  The daily and weekly economic developments in, and outside of, the country have opened people's eyes to the fact that Ireland is a small and vulnerable economy in the European context, never mind the global one.  We have competed for many years in a globalised market.  We now find that everyone is directly affected by what is happening outside and inside our borders.  I cannot blame people for being concerned about their economic position.  When we had crises in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, there was not as much information available as there is today.  People are exposed to 24-hour news broadcasts and the Internet and amass much information about what is happening elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500">We should not be sorry for what we have achieved in the past 20 years.  Much progress has been made which no one can deny.  There is much rhetoric about how we squandered this and that.  However, when one drives from one end of the country to the other, the improvements in our infrastructure are there for everyone to see.  A much larger percentage of our young people complete second level and third level education, which will stand to us in the years to come.  The difference between now and the 1980s is that we have a much better educated and progressive population, open to new ideas.  As we have proved over the past 20 years, we can take new technologies and adapt them to compete with the rest of the world.  In Dublin's inner city, young people are better educated than they were in the 1980s.  This is a strength upon which we can build.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">Every effort must be made to sustain and protect the economy which is the thrust of this Bill.  As one who started at the lowest rung in the Civil Service, I appreciate where people are coming from on the pension levy, particularly those on the lower wage scales.  When starting off in a public service job, one could be a long time in one position without getting promotion.  When I started in the Civil Service 25 years ago, there was an embargo on recruitment and promotion while a health levy was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">Every Member on this side of the House recognises the role played by the public service.  It is one of the main pillars of the country.  We are not out to do it damage.  We are asking the public service to come with the rest of us to contribute in remedying the current economic position.  We are not picking on civil servants.  It is extremely dangerous to go down the road of pitching public against private.  No one, either inside the House or outside, should go down that road as it is in nobody's interest.  It might sell newspapers or get some coverage on television.  Society, however, should not be divided.  The only way to tackle these current economic problems is by sticking together.  In the past 20 years, we have benefitted from social solidarity and partnership between all stakeholders.  This has proven hugely beneficial to Ireland Inc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">Prior to Christmas we reached a stage where, despite everyone's efforts, agreement could not be reached in respect of one matter.  It is to that matter the Bill before the House relates.  We should not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  We should continue to negotiate with the social partners.  Rather than engaging in rhetoric and denigration for the sake of doing so, it is crucial that we should call on all sectors to come together in order that we might work our way through the current difficulties.  That is the only way we will survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">The Government has been obliged to take difficult decisions in respect of which no one is in favour.  However, the alternatives are a matter of concern to us.  The further we go down this road — we have a long way to travel and the Bill represents only a first step — it will become clear that the decisions being taken now are in the interests of the country, of protecting ourselves and of sustaining what we have achieved to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">Previous speakers referred to the banks.  Like other Members, I am particularly disappointed with regard to the way some of the financial institutions carried out their business in recent times.  However, the reality is that we need a banking system — an economic framework within which people can save money or take out loans and mortgages to invest in their future.  Unfortunately, the existing system is under severe pressure as a result of both domestic and international events.  The actions taken in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, in particular, and the financial institutions, in general, in recent months were measured and necessary steps.  These had to be taken to regularise and stabilise our financial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">The bottom line is that we need a banking system.  We also need to protect people's savings and mortgages.  If we throw our hands up and walk away, these individuals — not to mention the thousands who each day deal with members of the public on behalf of the financial institutions — will be adversely affected.  Those at the top in the financial institutions have made mistakes and they will be called to account.  Guarantees in respect of the latter have been already forthcoming from those on this side of the House.  When the measures that have been put in place begin to take effect, people will appreciate that some of the difficult decisions we are making are designed to protect the country's future.  The alternatives do not bear thinking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507">I respect people's right to vent their frustrations.  Like other Members, I have spoken to many public servants during the past couple of weeks.  I also spoke to people in the private sector who are working three or four-day weeks or whose jobs are in danger.  These are the people we must protect.  As already stated, some of the measures required in this regard are unpalatable and difficult, particularly for us, as politicians, but also for those in the wider community.  In time, people will perceive these measures as having helped our cause.  I am of the opinion that they will ensure Ireland continues to thrive.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1508">I wish to share time with Deputies Perry and Neville.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I listened to a number of Government speakers who offered a stream of negativity and cast their eyes towards this side of the House in order to apportion blame to Fine Gael in respect of what has occurred.  My party has not been in power for 12 years but the economy was in good shape when we left office.  What has been said is unfair and it will not wash.  However, the previous two speakers, Deputies Chris Andrews and Cyprian Brady, made extremely positive and balanced contributions.  If there was more of that kind of debate, it would assist the process and increase the standing of this House among members of the public.  Deputies Chris Andrews and Cyprian Brady and I might differ in terms of approach, but good and wholesome debate of a magnanimous nature — which the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, promotes on most occasions — is always welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">Fine Gael set out its stall early in respect of the pension levy.  I was a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the 1980s during an extremely challenging period.  This was the era prior to American investment, the technology revolution, the advent of huge amounts of EU Structural Funds, the tax amnesties and the inquiries.  It was also the era prior to the banks beginning to lend money.  During the period in question, the banks penalised people and put them out of business.  Due to the fact that the banks could set them, at one point interest rates stood at more than 22%.  At that time, the banks were reckless with people's livelihoods in a different way and did a great deal of damage to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">I was a Member of the Seanad during the period to which I refer and I am in a position to state that there was not one positive contribution made by those who were in opposition.  They did not indicate the areas in which they would spend money or outline where they would make cuts.  Instead, they engaged in total opposition.  Fine Gael is at least bringing forward proposals in this regard at present.  We made such a proposal in respect of where the €2 billion in savings might be made.  That is unprecedented in this House.  Deputies Bruton and Kenny have put forward several proposals, but they appear to be falling on deaf ears.  People do not want to give the Deputies credit.  What Deputy Bruton has stated in respect of bad banks, good banks, etc., might be the only option.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">I wish to speak on behalf of public servants, particularly those in my constituency who are friends of mine.  I received approximately 400 e-mails from teachers, gardaí, HSE employees, lecturers, etc., who are angry and are of the view that they have been identified for special treatment.  When these people consider that there are 20,000 individuals in the private sector who each earn more than €200,000 per annum and whose incomes are not being touched, they become extremely angry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513">Two Saturdays ago, I was visited at my clinic by a woman who is married to a civil servant who works in the town in which I live and who earns €45,000 per year.  They have two children and lead a normal life.  She informed me that when they pay their expenses — mortgage, etc. — they have only €100 left over to purchase clothes and other things for themselves and their children.  The family to which I refer is living on the breadline.  However, the average wage in the public service is between €30,000 and €33,000.  Those earning that amount are really being penalised.  The case has been made that people on higher incomes who can reclaim tax, will pay less than those to whom I refer.  That is why they are angry and annoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514">Deputy Cyprian Brady referred to a wedge.  That wedge has been driven deep and the solidarity that was created through social partnership — of which I am very much in favour and which I would hate to see being abandoned — has disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515">People are becoming extremely riled in respect of the issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government nationalised Anglo Irish Bank but allowed those who took the decision on what has been described as the Quinn shares deal and who were involved in the loan from Irish Life &amp; Permanent to remain in charge.  The old guard has regrouped and retained control of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516">While I was pleased to learn members of the Garda Síochána were sent into Anglo Irish Bank today at the request of the Office of Corporate Enforcement, why was the Garda not involved earlier?  Senior executives of the bank should step aside until the current investigations by the Office of Corporate Enforcement and Financial Regulator have been completed.  The Taoiseach has indicated these executives must receive due process.  Let them step aside and allow others run the bank while the investigations are taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">Many farmers around the country are up to their necks in debt as a result of decisions taken on the farm waste management scheme.  They were forced to borrow money and proceed with works because of the manner in which the scheme was administered, the deadline which applied and so forth.  They are now in trouble as they face the prospect of a 15 cent reduction in the price of a litre of milk, non-payment of the rural environment protection scheme payment arising from bureaucracy and the non-payment of moneys under the farm waste management scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, will know many farmers in County Roscommon who will be adversely affected by the provision to pay outstanding moneys under the farm waste management scheme in instalments of 40%, 40% and 20%.  This will create a further crisis shortly.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_416">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_1518">Last week, one of the national newspapers featured a piece by a commentator which concluded with the words, "As we approach the inferno we see Dante's injunction: "Abandon hope all ye who enter here.""  Has the nation come to this point?</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">Irish people have a tendency to swing between the outer limits of optimism and pessimism and spend little time in the middle ground.  In retrospect, it is clear we have passed through a period of foolish optimism.  However, we must avoid entering a phase of hyper-critical self-flagellation, depression and fatalism in which everything appears to be outside our control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">Throughout our history, we have experienced bad and poor times but a sufficient number of people had faith and conviction in the future of the country to allow us to muddle through.  This is also the case at present.  Ireland has much going for it.  It is a relatively rich country with a good standard of living and well educated population.  Irish people can also muster a real sense of community when needed.  The reality of life, especially in a crisis, is that we can only do the best we can.  Somehow we will muddle through but in trying to find ways to address the present crisis we must face reality.  The Government, too, must face reality because citizens' confidence in it has been shattered.  The future of the country is at stake and confidence in the country and Government can be rebuilt only through facing reality and dealing honestly with the reasons we found ourselves in the current mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">In my experience in business I have found dealing with a crisis to be simple.  It is akin to tackling a house on fire in the sense that one can either react by trying to put out the fire with whatever tools one has at one's disposal or one can listen to other voices who tell us we should sit down and review the position in a series of meetings and then, armed with all available information, make a plan to put out the fire and rebuild the new house.  Crises demand real and immediate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">As a country we face one major problem, namely, the growing national economic crisis and the loss of thousands of jobs every month.  We also have a massive hole in the Government finances and a banking crisis.  The latter is a sideshow when viewed in the context of the well-being of the national economy.  The preservation of jobs must, therefore, be our top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">The Government appears to be almost relieved that the focus is on banks, bail-outs and public sector levies as these distract from the crisis it caused in the national economy.  The first and immediate step to restoring the national economy must be to rebuild consumer confidence in order that domestic demand can lead to recovery.  A fundamental problem is that in Ireland, as in most other countries in the world, people are frightened and domestic demand has declined, leading to further falls in Government tax income.  In our case, this is evident in declining revenue from VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">To regenerate consumer confidence an essential first step is for the Government to demonstrate, for as long as it remains in power, that its members are people of genuine character and substance.  I do not say this to score political points.  The Government must clearly accept responsibility for its part in creating the mess in which we find ourselves.  To show it is capable of genuine leadership in this crisis, it must first show it is able to deal honestly and openly with reality.  If trust is to be rebuilt, it must acknowledge its responsibility for its part in the making of the current crisis.  Why should we expect anyone else to squarely face reality when the Government still refuses to acknowledge reality?  It must tell the truth about what happened and place the facts in the public domain to enable us to start to address fundamental issues and restore confidence in the economy.  If it is not able to do this, it must step aside and allow the Opposition to try to solve our current problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">On consumer spending, I do not belong to those who believe governments should spend ever increasing amounts of borrowed money to prime the economy.  All past evidence shows that an excessive proportion of such additional consumer expenditure is spent on imports, thus making a minimal contribution to the national economy.  Anecdotal evidence also suggests that consumers are using any spare cash they have to add to savings or to pay off debt.  An additional financial stimulus using more borrowed money would have little direct impact on the national economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">The critical element of any solution must be to address the issue of jobs.  We must take all possible steps to protect existing jobs.  Ireland is an open, exporting economy and only the manufacturing sector can provide the volume of quality jobs to give full employment.  Companies are closing down and jobs are moving abroad, in some cases to other European Union countries as opposed to low wage economies elsewhere.  This demonstrates that our costs are seriously out of line with competitor countries.  We must reduce costs in the public and private sectors and State agencies must work intensively with local businesses to help protect jobs.  There is no other solution in the short to medium term.  Stimulating job creation must focus on local enterprises, including the critically important retail sector.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1527">I propose to address a specific issue about which I am extremely concerned in the context of the recession and increasing unemployment.  International research dating back to 1987 shows that in times of recession the incidence of suicide increases considerably.  Research done in every decade since the 1980s has confirmed this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">In times of recession, stress levels increase significantly among those who are rendered unemployed.  Mental illness also increases among this group owing to external factors affecting its members.  Depressive illness, which contributes to suicide, increases, as do financial difficulties.  As we are aware, financial problems can give rise to a belief that one cannot deal with one's circumstances other than by taking the desperate act of ending one's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">Health problems also increase among those who are made unemployed.  General health problems frequently result in emotional problems and, in some cases, psychiatric illness.  Opportunities to engage in education are no longer as widely available in a recession.  People who are made unemployed fear for their futures, their families and their homes.  They experience anger about the position in which they find themselves, are disappointed and insecure and feel a sense of hopelessness and low self-esteem.  This combination is a recipe for serious problems and people will become suicidal.  Unfortunately, there will be an increase in the number of people who see no way out of their hopelessness other than to consider taking their lives.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1550">I moved this motion in the names of the members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  It does not need telling either to the Acting Chairman or to the rest of the House that we are in deep crisis.  The time for denial of the extent of the crisis is past.  The pretence that Government has a strategy adequate to address that crisis is also totally inadequate.  We are now in a serious situation in which not only is the credibility of Ireland's public finances at stake, but the credibility of the banking system and our ability to get it going again is intimately tied up with the state of the public finances.  It will be impossible to rebuild public confidence in our banks — for which the State has offered a guarantee, recapitalisation, and the development of a new insurance-based model to deal with risky management — unless there is belief, internationally and domestically, that this Government has a coherent strategy to tackle the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">We learned in January the parlous state of the public finances in a brief document presented by the Department of Finance.  It acknowledges that over the next five years we must correct a problem to the extent of €16.5 billion.  Since that document was produced, the scale of the problem has got worse.  All the Government has done to date is to introduce one set of measures, primarily focused on a public service pension levy, which will generate €2 billion.  If the Government believes that is a credible five-year fiscal strategy, we are in a very serious position.  It does not constitute a credible fiscal strategy.  We will only have a credible strategy under a number of conditions.  The first is that it must be comprehensive.  People must know what is expected of them and what will be expected of others.  It must be sufficiently specific for people to know, for example, the balance between spending and tax revenue and that people know the types of tax to be applied.  People must know that the Government will move beyond simple rules of thumb to try to find savings in public spending, to forensically examine public spending and to change the way we spend money so we get value for money.  Another requirement — let us be blunt about it — is to front-load the decisions to restore international confidence that we are capable of managing our own affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">The Government was in denial for a great deal of last year.  It has come to the pace of the game far too slowly and has arrived out of breath and inadequately prepared.  It must recognise that many of the problems we now face are not ones that came miraculously from abroad but were created over years by a style of government that met difficult problems by buying people off, that ducked tough decisions about reform, that did not apply proper scrutiny or standards in regulation, and that allowed a cosy circle to develop whose members had too much access, so that when things went wrong they were not held accountable.  We are now living with the reality of that style of government.  Until the Government recognises that to change the way Ireland develops it must change all the things that led to this, we will not see the sort of reform that is required and we will not see international confidence rebuilt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">To pretend the banking system is simply an independent problem, divorced from the public finances, is a mistake.  The credibility of the Government's guarantee is linked to people's belief that it can honour that guarantee, and that in turn is linked to their perception of whether the Government is in control of public finances — whether it has a strategy that is credible, well constructed, sound and able to meet the challenges.  Unfortunately, the Government has failed on all these counts.  That is the broader context in which I move this motion.  Yes, we must tidy up our banking system and have an entirely fresh start, but we must also address our serious wider economic problems to restore credibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">I listened to the Taoiseach today and I found his remarks deeply dispiriting.  He could not resist denigrating the efforts of other parties to offer constructive solutions.  He dwelt in half-truths, trying to run down what other people had suggested.  Parties such as mine have consistently pointed out the necessity of a different way.  We have done that for years.  As recently as last October we said the budget was wrongly constructed and we could not afford the pay increases to which the Government was committing.  We were scoffed at, and the Government has not moved beyond that.  The Taoiseach seemed to welcome a degree of consensus, but the only consensus acceptable to him would be the Opposition's signing up to Government proposals——</p>

            <p eId="para_1556">——which would be introduced by way of a guillotine, as we have seen time and again, with no opportunity for debate about the options.  That is what the Taoiseach sees as the role of this House.  The House is facing a crisis, as is the whole country, and unless Government can be open to new ideas we will go down the tubes.  That is the state of affairs.  This Government has shown that it cannot fix the crisis we are in and it has not been capable of addressing the scale of the crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">I do not need to tell Members that the banking sector is of core importance.  It is the oil that keeps the engine of the economy ticking over.  Households could not survive without it; businesses cannot survive without it.  Businesses and households are already seeing the consequences of the interruption in the flow of credit.  The problems that many businesses are now facing are made greatly worse by their inability to obtain funding to tide them over more difficult trading periods.  We do not have a banking system that is adequate for the challenge this economy faces.  We must see Government respond much more decisively to this challenge than has been the case so far.  The tragedy is that there has been a consistent failure of the regulators either to understand the information presented to them, to pass it up the line or to act on it.  This has been of major damage to our international reputation.  If we persist with a regulatory system that has failed in such an appalling way — that is still struggling to come to terms with conflicting evidence about what it knew and what it failed to do — we will make our financial crisis greater.  We must now make a clean break as far as the regulator is concerned.  We must sack or remove the entire regulatory authority and, along with it, the senior management.  We must establish a new regulatory authority with the power and the ability to bring in a new regime based on a much sterner ethic than we have ever seen before.  It is not acceptable that the body investigating misdemeanours in the regulatory system is the regulatory authority itself.  We cannot expect an authority to be judge and jury in its own case and provide the proper investigation that we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">We can now get rid of the existing authority and bring in a new one that includes international representatives.  Over a short space of time, such as three or six months, we should require that new authority to establish a Q mark of internationally sound regulatory standards.  If the Government agrees to this, I would take heart that Members on the benches opposite understand the depths of the problems we currently face.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">We must also recognise that the present relationship between the Central Bank and the Department of Finance is not acceptable.  The notion that Secretaries General of the Department can seamlessly become Governors of the Central Bank is not an acceptable way to manage our affairs because those with the responsibility of calling halt in respect of policies on credit and fiscal strategy are compromised.  We must move to a new style of appointing governors through competitions which are open to all comers, including international applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">Banks are in a unique position of trust because not only do they have similarly limited liabilities to all other companies but, effectively, they also have an implicit guarantee that the taxpayer will step in when difficulties arise.  That puts a huge burden of responsibility on those who manage our banks because the privilege conferred by the underwriting of banks by taxpayers comes with a duty of care.  The truth is, however, that banks and their managers abused this privilege for their own enrichment.  The boards, which shareholders would have expected to supervise banks' activities, failed in their duty of governance.  The regulators, whom we appointed to ride shotgun, failed to recognise the flaws and, even when they came into the possession of information, did not understand its seriousness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">We need a comprehensive clean out in the management of banks.  The minimum we require are fresh boards and new executives in the banks that are being recapitalised by the State.  These people should be on salaries which are commensurate with the compensation paid to someone running a public service operation.  They should not receive the commissions which led us into the difficulties we currently face or bonuses that are linked to profitability.  Their salaries have to be capped, in which regard we have proposed a figure of €250,000.  The auditors, on whom we depended for overseeing the performance of the banking system, have also let us down.  We need to appoint new auditors to all the banks to demonstrate a fresh start.  We should look beyond the charmed circle of international names to other auditors who may be more probing and have a better understanding of how to conduct an audit.  Perhaps such an auditing firm would not assign junior staff to crucial elements of scrutiny.  A fresh start is needed in all aspects of banks' operations if we are to restore confidence.  That is not asking too much because, as taxpayers, we are now standing in the breach.  We will have to guarantee all the liabilities, offer solutions to some of the huge holes that exist in the loan books and recapitalise the banks.  We are entitled, therefore, to see these radical changes in our banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">We must also address the wrongdoing that has taken place.  The public rightly wants wrongdoing relentlessly pursued.  I share the view of one Minister who has described these events as economic treason but we require action that is commensurate with such a level of wrongdoing.  We are not seeing the wholesale changes that are needed in response to a Minister's belief that economic treason has been perpetrated.  I do not impugn the values or intentions of the Government but the public sees people who had extraordinary access to those in authority and a regulatory system comprising officials drawn from the same circles as the executives they regulated.  The public's confidence has been decimated by what has happened in Anglo Irish Bank and other institutions.  The concealment of directors' loans seriously damages shareholders' interests.  We now know it probably represents a breach of company law and we hope this will be pursued.  We are also aware that the unwinding of the major shareholding held by the Quinn Group in Anglo Irish Bank was orchestrated by people within the bank.  That suggests <i>prima facie</i> evidence of serious breaches of company law.  A company cannot orchestrate the purchase of its own shares and fund them on a charmed basis or in a way that preserves the anonymity of those who benefitted from the deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">People have a right to know how these decisions were reached and who was involved.  As we saw in the report published last week on Anglo Irish Bank, the taxpayer is going to pick up the bill at the end of the day.  Not only was this loan delivered in such a way that 75% of the money was without recourse because it was secured on the shareholdings themselves but we now learn that the bank believes it will be unable to recover the remaining 25% in full.  Those who are on this list have not even honoured the small element expected of them.  The taxpayer, who is left to bear the burden of what a Minister has described as economic treason, has the right to know who was involved.  I believe there are many on the Government benches who want these people to be named.  While this is not the core issue, it would be a symbol of the Government's determination to introduce change.  The failure to use the powers granted by the Central Bank Act or the Companies Act 1990 to put these names in the public domain sends the signal that this Government is not determined to make a clean sweep.  The message which has to be sent is that the Government intends to turn over every stone in its determination to ensure wrongdoing is not sheltered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">Rhetoric is no longer of any value.  International observers, on whom the success of our banking system and our ability to borrow depend, are not interested in rhetoric.  They want action rather than tough talk from Ministers.  Until we present convincing evidence that everything has changed in terms of regulation, a fresh approach to banking and the public finances and credible proposals which can be delivered within timescales that will impact on the public finances, we will continue to labour without international confidence.  If we cannot rebuild international confidence in our capacity to manage our own affairs, we will run into difficulties in funding our finances and the guarantees and capital commitments we have made to the banks.  If this happens, our economic independence will be undermined.  Many people fought long and hard to secure our economic independence.  The successful economic model created by many people on all sides of this House has been hugely damaged.  We now need to have confidence that the Government is willing to take the actions necessary to resolve the problems and to meet the challenges we face.</p>

            <p eId="para_1566">This motion is a constructive contribution towards putting in place an appropriate and decisive response to our current banking crisis.  Each week, the Government calls on Opposition parties to support its proposals in the national interest, to make constructive contributions and to put forward new ideas.  That is exactly what this motion, through a list of specific actions, seeks to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">Light-handed regulation and cosy relationships between senior bankers, the Financial Regulator's office, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and, ultimately, Government has resulted in misinformation, market deception and deliberate concealment of vital information from shareholders, the markets and the public relating to the financial health of certain banks.  The consequence of this failure is enormous.  As the Taoiseach correctly stated this afternoon, we are now battling for the very viability of our economy.  The reputation of Ireland's banking system and financial sector generally is in tatters internationally and must be rebuilt.  The ability of our surviving banks to access capital is compromised and exposure to bad debt is being upgraded by the day.  Also, our banking model for business is not working thus frustrating viable trading opportunities.  More important, the prospect of the State being exposed to an actual call on the bank guarantee is now a real consideration at a time when it is increasingly difficult for the State to raise funds and when the deficit between revenue and expenditure is out of control.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">There is no point in not talking about the gravity of the fiscal situation in an effort not to undermine already shaky confidence.  The Fianna Fáil way is to tell people only what the have to know and to keep bad news from the public, as if people cannot handle the truth.  It is the kind of thinking that resulted in this Government not telling this House the full facts before asking us to make enormous decisions around bank recapitalisation or the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  All of the proposals in the Fine Gael motion will need to be implemented if we are to expose the truth, prosecute bankers who have broken the law, remove regulators who have failed in their responsibilities and put in place new structures upon which we can build a new tough, but fair, regulatory system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">Along with the recommendations outlined in this motion we need a new type of politics with people taking responsibility for their actions and failures rather than trying to cover their tracks in a dishonest way.  This fiasco is a monumental failure of governance and a catalogue of unacceptable practices in Irish banking.  This failure of Government must also result in scrutiny, exposure and reform, which is the primary job of this Opposition.  The Government's explanations of who knew what and when are, to me, simply not credible.  There is no point in my saying otherwise in this House if I believe it not to be so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">I wish now to focus on the back-to-back dealings between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish life &amp; Permanent in September 2008 and the further revelations in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  This is not the first time I have heard the suggestion that the regulator knew about Anglo’s arrangements to give a false impression of its deposit base.  I ask the Minister of State present in the House this evening, is it credible<b> </b>that the Department of Finance knew nothing of what Anglo Irish Bank was doing if the Financial Regulator was clearly aware of it?  Let us not forget the Department was at that time preparing legislation to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and would have been monitoring the bank closely and communicating almost on a daily basis with the bank and the Regulator.  In that context, is it credible<b> </b>that the Minister for Finance and his Department were not tracking closely what was happening to Anglo’s deposit base and would not have noticed €7 billion being deposited into the bank and taken out less than a week later, after the financial year end?  Is it credible<b> </b>that in late September, before the bank guarantee scheme was announced, when the Minister for Finance took a hands on approach and was personally leaning on other Irish banks — Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks — to source up to €5 billion each to make available to Anglo because it needed capital, that the Minister was not up to speed with the mechanisms Anglo Irish Bank was using to source funds and shore up its deposit base?  Is it credible<b> </b>that when the bank guarantee scheme was in place, when the Minister commissioned and received a copy of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, that he did not read all the detail relating to Anglo Irish Bank, the one bank his Department was so worried about it and was going to nationalise weeks earlier?  The Minister for Finance is one of the leading legal brains in the country, a top senior counsel, yet we in this House are being asked to accept that he did not read the most important brief ever laid on his desk?  I cannot accept this as credible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">We are also asked to believe that the Minister was not informed by his officials of an issue of this consequence.  Is it credible that the Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance for four years did not receive a copy of the PwC report, conveniently absolving him from any knowledge of its contents?  Our Taoiseach is entrusted with making decisions that may literally make or break our country and we are expected to believe he did not read this report commissioned by Government to examine the health of our banks.  I could go on and on and try to further unravel the story that Government expects us to accept and believe in respect of this one incident between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, but I do not have time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The political claim that Government knew nothing about the wheeling and dealing that was going on in an effort to prop up a collapsing banking model in Ireland, linked to property exposure, is about as credible as making the case that the regulator knew nothing either.</p>

            <p eId="para_1576">There is a lack of international confidence in our banks and our economy for two reasons, namely, a lack of credibility in our  banking system and, a lack of any economic strategy to get us out the situation in which we currently find ourselves.  This was articulated last Sunday week in some of the newspapers by the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and is leading to an enormous degree of international concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">Deputy Bruton set out earlier what needs to be done if we are to get out of the mess into which this Government has got us.  As part of that plan we need far-reaching reform in every sector of the economy, starting with our banking sector.  First, we must urgently review the banking bonus structure which incentivised irresponsible lending within the banking system.  It seems nothing has been learned by the banking sector.  Recently, the Bank of Ireland announced a special 2.45% one-year rate for first time buyers.  Prior to this Anglo Irish Bank announced at 2.49% one-year special rate.  The idea behind this is the bank's belief that once a person takes out a mortgage it may be too costly or too much hassle for him or her to switch to another lender, thus ensuring borrowers remain with their initial lender for many years.  The difficulty is that the maths does not add up.  Currently, the European Central Bank rate is 2%.  The average rates for mortgages here for first or second time buyers is approximately 2% above the European Central Bank rate.  The bargain rates for one year are being offered to young couples, but they will be hiked by at least 1.5% subsequently, over-extending many young families again.  This is the same practice which got us into the problems and the situation we face at the moment.  It is clear nothing has changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">We urgently need responsible banking.  The pool of skilled personnel within the regulatory and financial services sectors is far too small.  People move from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank to the Financial Regulator, or from the banking sector into that chain of supervision.  We need a regulator from outside the current gene pool.  This Pat, John, Mary and Willie atmosphere must be broken up once and for all.  This was articulated very well in an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday.  Mr. Willie McAteer recalled an exchange with Mr. Pat Neary in which he told Mr. Neary that the bank would manage the balance sheet at the end of the year, in other words, it would cook the books.  Mr. Neary reportedly replied, “Fair play to you”.  This is not light touch regulation, but slap-on-the-back regulation.  The attitude within the banks was to present the issue of the day in a manner which would gain the rubber stamp of the regulator.  However, if that did not work a bank would go cap in hand to the Department of Finance to get its blessing for the same cock and bull story.  This took place continually in the regulatory sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">The difficulty is far too many businesses, jobs and homes depend on a properly functioning banking system.  The continuous drip feeding of information from the Government is damaging the perception of our banking system internationally and in the country.  In tandem with the changes outlined by Deputy Richard Bruton, we urgently require the publication of the reports by "An Bord Snip" and the Commission on Taxation.  The Government said it will not fast track these reports.  It has not approached either of the authors of the reports, but we must have these reports published now.  We also need a new budget now.  There is no confidence in the Government either in the country or internationally.  We urgently need a responsible and accountable Government that will make the decisions to get us out of the mess into which this Government has landed us.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_1580">I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, to the House.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion and I wish to discuss one aspect in which we may move forward.  Those of us on this side of the House are proactive.  We provide ideas and we fulfil our national obligation in doing so.  As far as banking is concerned, we are in an era which is totally unscripted.  All manuals can be burned and all principles have been undermined.  The underlying principle for banking and credit extension to small businesses was that the banks had a monopoly on wisdom.  There has been intellectual snobbery whereby it was assumed the man in the swivel chair knew more than the man in the wooden chair.  The notion that the businessman would approach his local bank manager with his cap in his hand seeking a loan or an extension to an overdraft was a matter of course.  Recession 2009 offers us a chance to change this notion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">I welcome the proposals from Deputy Richard Bruton seeking a fresh start, which is where we must look for the answers.  It offers us a chance to replace the existing model with a very different one.  The tragic collapse of the economy and the banking system demonstrates that the long-standing guiding principle does not work.  The thinking which landed us in this mess will not get us out of it.  We must engage at two levels.  We must engage with those in the financial sector and with those under pressure who are concerned at what will happen next week, rather than next month or in six months time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">There is talk of Ireland reaching out to Europe.  The thinking within the financial institutions at present is that a plan should be in place.  At present there is no such plan.  We must have a plan to anticipate what will occur.  Events are changing rapidly in the financial sector.  In the small and medium sized enterprise, SME, sector there is frustration because of the lack of credit flowing.  There was an advertisement two weeks ago in broadsheet newspapers from a bank, indicating it wished to get credit moving again, to lend money to SMEs and to issue mortgages.  However, this is still not taking place because of a vacuum between the banking and SME sectors.  We must reshape the current model and the way in which we bank.  It is not a question of the man in the swivel chair holding a monopoly on wisdom and the man on the wooden chair with a business idea.  There is a vacuum in that interface.  This is where the Government has an opportunity.  The Minister is aware of enterprise boards throughout the length and breadth of the country and different agencies which can be utilised in the interface between businesses and the banking sector.  We are at a crossroads in terms of the way in which to get things moving.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">My clinics are attended by young and old people.  They are attended by people who wish to continue with their business but who still cannot access credit.  There must be change in this regard.  Those in the SME sector will drive us out of the recession and will create jobs at local level.  People from my constituency contact me on a daily basis with business ideas.  However, the Minister for Finance and the Governments of the past ten years have stifled and crippled small business through red tape and bureaucracy.  We must work to improve matters on a cross-departmental level.</p>

On each occasion the Government has intervened in the banking difficulties it has made matters worse.  It is beyond my comprehension how it can get it wrong time after time.

            <p eId="para_1586">I say that without gladness.  Part of the problem is that we have had a single party State.  For 20 of the past 22 years the Minister's party has been in Government.  How could a supposedly independent financial regulator criticise the Government for the actions it took in recent years?  We will pay for the excesses of the past ten, 12 and 14 years in decades to come.  Of that there is no question or doubt.  Children not yet born will pay tax in years to come to tidy up this mess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">The €7 billion placed into Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland has been consumed by the market.  At present, Bank of Ireland shares are worth 30 cent and Allied Irish Banks shares are worth less than 40 cent, an indication of the confidence of the international markets.  We find ourselves in a position in which we face economic catastrophe.  It is a case of Armageddon in terms of what will happen to us in the short term, let alone the medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">Businesses require cash flow and funds and these are not being provided at present.  The banks may meet the Minister and claim this is the case, but it is not so.  Without jobs the economy will falter ever further.  As Deputy McHugh stated, jobs can only be facilitated with funds.  Business can only be facilitated through the availability of funds.  There are a remarkable number of viable businesses which need to overcome the difficulty of a cash flow hump and the banks are not providing the necessary help.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">I refer to remuneration and pay in the higher echelons of banking.  Remarkably, a reduction in the pay of such people has been discussed in terms equivalent to almost twice the amount that President Obama is considering for the directors of banks in the United States.  These banks are many times larger than ours.  I do not know how we can consider paying this sum; €250,000, or €20,000 per month is equivalent to the Minister's salary.  It is a fortune and the most that should be ever considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1613">While commentators here are naturally very focused on our internal problems and we are all focused on them by the difficulties in accessing credit, it is important to put the banking crisis in a global context.  Governments across the world are grappling with the collapsing confidence in the global financial system and are intervening in various ways to try to achieve the best possible outcomes for their countries.  It is important therefore to understand what I see as the Irish strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">I am keen to ensure there is an independent banking sector in Ireland.  That requires us to protect systemically important banks and avoid nationalisation of these institutions if at all possible.  My aim is to ensure there continues to be competition in the Irish market for consumers.  To that end, we are seeking to ensure that Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks continue as a strong and competitive banking presence in the marketplace.  Given the uncertain position of the UK and foreign owned banks, we would ideally like to see a third significant Irish player in the banking sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">The prerequisites for the success of this strategy are sufficient liquidity in the system and adequate capitalisation of our banks.  The Government guarantee scheme introduced in 2008 was designed to ensure that the banks would have sufficient liquidity to operate on a day-to-day basis.  This move has since been followed by many other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">Market expectations with regard to the capital that banks hold have altered significantly.  As a result banks have had to compete vigorously for deposits and other forms of funding in a weakening economic environment.  Banks have been also forced to seek capital in an unwilling and unfriendly market, resulting in an array of State recapitalisation programmes across the developed world.  It is in this context that we have announced our plans to capitalise the two main banks.  In due course, we will examine the remaining institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">In this challenging period for the banking sector, when investors dealing with banks are even more risk conscious, the good standing of a bank, its reputation and a strong ethos of corporate governance through its board and senior management becomes even more important.  There have been important issues for the Government to address in taking on this role, at a time when we have also to ensure fiscal prudence, taking difficult decisions to ensure our competitiveness internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The Government is providing €3.5 billion in core Tier 1 capital for each of the two main banks.  The capital to be provided to each was determined following detailed engagement with the banks themselves, and with the benefit of survey information of the bank's loan books, which was conducted for the Financial Regulator by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  A careful assessment was made of the potential losses that the banks face on their loan books in the coming years, taking into account the impact of likely trends in property values and various stress scenarios for the economy.  I was criticised in some quarters for being slow to proceed with a recapitalisation of our major financial institutions, but I strongly believe that the time spent on assessing as accurately as possible the capital requirements of each bank, was worthwhile in terms of the assurance that can now be offered to the markets on the levels of capital in the two largest banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">The level of capital being provided by the State will boost the core Tier 1 capital ratio of AIB to 8.5% and that of Bank of Ireland to 9%.  It is important to note that these are high capital ratios by international standards.  The banks will therefore be in a strong position to raise the funding they require on international markets and withstand loan losses arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">The continued flow of credit is vital for our economy.  To establish the exact position regarding the availability of credit, the recapitalised banks have agreed to fund, and co-operate with, an independent review of credit availability which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives.  The recapitalised banks have also agreed to work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and with State agencies to ensure the supply of appropriate finance to contractors engaged on major projects sponsored by them.  They have also agreed to engage in a clearing group to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  The two banks have also agreed to provide €15 million each to a new seed capital fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">The international credit crunch is severely limiting the availability of credit to sound businesses and thereby doing severe damage to our economy.  The bank customer package announced as part of the recapitalisation programme addresses this problem in several ways.  First, the banks have agreed to make additional funds available for lending.  Second, a statutory code of conduct for small and medium sized enterprise, SME, lending has been devised to help create a better balance for such lending and to give potential borrowers greater confidence.  This covers all banks, not just those recapitalised.  Third, the independent review of credit availability will give a definite picture of the current supply, demand and conditions for business lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">In addition, on 13 February 2009 the Financial Regulator published statutory codes of practice on business lending and mortgage arrears and these apply to all banks.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform them of the basis for decisions in relation to their accounts and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Decisions to grant, refuse or alter credit must be taken on a case by case basis.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will allow reasonable time to seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  I stress that this is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">The code of practice on mortgage arrears applies to all mortgage lending on a customer's principal private residence.  A lender may not seek repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower.  The code will ensure that mortgage lenders can commence legal action for repossession only six months from the time arrears first arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">I want to address issues relating to Anglo Irish Bank.  In January, against a background of concerns about governance issues and market confidence in Anglo Irish Bank, the Government, following consultation with the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Financial Regulator, decided to take Anglo into public ownership.  This decisive step was taken to safeguard the interest of the depositors of Anglo, and the stability of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">The Government, along with the entire country, has been shocked by the revelations of practices in Anglo Irish Bank and, as I have said time and again, we are fully committed to getting to the bottom of the position and ensuring that the full rigours of the law are applied to anyone who is found to have abused the system.  We will fully investigate the loans to Seán FitzPatrick, the Seán Quinn share transaction and the Irish Life &amp; Permanent deposit arrangement.  Any further issues that may emerge will also be dealt with by appropriate action but we remain fully cognisant of, and committed to, upholding the principle of natural justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">It is now vitally important that the country regains confidence in its banking system.  There are many thousands of loyal and hard-working banking staff who are shocked at recent revelations.  It is important that they, and the public, can be reassured about the long-term future of the financial sector in Ireland.  Collectively, we need to give the international markets confidence in the long-term future of Ireland's financial sector.  Continued revelations of alleged malfeasance damage us individually and collectively.  Above all else, they cast a severe slur on the reputation of the country overseas.  It is incumbent on all of us, including the media, to ensure a balance is struck between the exposition of past wrongdoing and the solidity and proper functioning of a significant and important part of the country's infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">There is no doubt that we inherited problems in the banking sector.  There has been much comment about how they might be resolved.  Deputy Bruton referred to it as a legacy issue.  As I said in my recapitalisation statement, the Government is prepared to examine proposals, such as the establishment of an insurance scheme or the creation of a bad bank.  Other innovative Irish solutions may be needed to deal with the problem.  As Deputies may know, I have appointed Dr. Peter Bacon to work in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency to compile a report and to advise me on suitable options in this area.  Members should not be under any illusions — the option that has been canvassed in this House and elsewhere is an expensive one.  Giving the guarantee may result in a payment being made back to the State and the decision to recapitalise may result in the State obtaining a return on its investment, but the decision to provide some form of protection in regard to risk assets in the banks will inform a substantial up front commitment, or deferred commitment, on the part of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">There was considerable debate and discussion on this topic at a recent meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the EU.  Member states expressed a desire for an EU-wide response.  Deputies will be aware that the British Government has examined many possible options in this area.  It may announce a scheme in the coming weeks.  I firmly believe there is no huge benefit to being first out of the traps with a solution on this issue.  The best approach is to learn from other experiences and to move as quickly as possible when a scheme has been devised that uniquely suits the Irish circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">It is universally accepted that bank regulation on a global scale has been too lax.  Ireland is no exception in this regard.  It is clear that a new structure is required.  I am committed to its implementation.  I have already indicated in the House that this may involve the merger of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  I am close to securing international expertise to advise me further on this matter.  While such expertise might guide me, it will not take the form of a consultancy.  Decisions must be made by the Government.  I will bring proposals to the Government in that regard.  As the House will appreciate, the oversight of the banks has been greatly intensified since the introduction of the credit institutions financial support scheme.  The new regime provides for heightened direct engagement with each of the covered institutions.  It also provides for new reporting arrangements, including the provision of scheme compliance certificates by the covered institutions and their external auditors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">The requirements and conditions of the bank guarantee scheme represent the first step in a new system of financial regulation and supervision.  The joint boards of the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority are considering further reform measures.  I have received a report in that regard.  I will examine it closely.  Other regulatory considerations, domestically and at international level, are under way.  The Financial Regulator is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach to ensure it meets its statutory mandate and responds to EU developments in financial regulation.  The regulator's business process review, which is designed to improve the effectiveness and value for money of the regulator, is close to conclusion.  The Financial Regulator is processing its strategic plan for 2009.  At EU level, new regulatory proposals, including improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive, are due for adoption in early 2009.  More generally, the Economic and Financial Affairs Council will incorporate the work being carried out at a wider international level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">The roles and mandates of national regulators are the subject of deep consideration.  Proposals will be made on matters such as prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight.  There is no doubt that there needs to be accountability in the financial sector for what has happened.  That is not an issue in this House.  A number of senior personnel have stood down for various reasons.  I have made it clear that more will follow when appropriate.  The EU has been consulted at all stages regarding any involvement in the banking sector.  In the next few days, an EU high level group will unveil its blueprint for reforming the financial system.  This is one of several topics I will discuss with the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, when he visits Ireland on Thursday.  It is essential that we work with our EU counterparts, the European Central Bank and the European Commission to ensure that a consistent and decisive approach is adopted to allow us to emerge from this difficult time with a strong and well-regulated banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">I have made it clear that there will be a new pay regime in the Irish banking sector.  It is imperative that this regime is organised in a way that ensures that rewards in the sector are structured to meet the long-term objectives of the banking institutions and the overall health of the Irish financial system.  The banks have accepted this in principle.  Firm commitments to abolish bonuses and to reduce substantially the salaries of senior executives and directors have been made by Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland in the context of the recapitalisation scheme.  The Government awaits the findings of the committee on remuneration, which was set up under the guarantee scheme at the prompting of many Members of the Oireachtas from all parties.  The committee's findings will help us to flesh out and implement these principles.  I am advised that the committee, which is led by Mr. Eddie Sullivan, will publish its report on 5 March 2009.  I understand the report may recommend that the salaries of senior executives be capped.  It is clear that remuneration in the Irish banking sector should not incentivise the kind of conduct we saw in the past, such as excessive lending.  I am satisfied that bonuses have been eliminated during the guarantee period.  Such abuses can be eliminated if there is a careful review of any incentivisation.  It is clear that the salaries of many executives are way out of line with the salaries of comparable executives in Irish companies of a similar size and scale.  In that context, it is essential that Mr. Sullivan's report will be brought to the Government for consideration at the earliest opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">The Government recognises that the future prosperity of the country will be determined by the actions we take now.  We have a strategy to deal with the complex problems in the banking sector.  We have acted firmly and fairly in the national interest.  The Government's approach to the banking system has been structured and measured.  A priority for the Government has been to ensure that all interventions in the banking sector have as their ultimate goal the benefit to the taxpayer of ensuring stability and securing the position of the customers of the banks — account holders, mortgage holders, businesses and enterprises.  I ask the House to support the amended motion and to provide the leadership needed to see us through this crisis.  I ask Dáil Éireann to affirm its support for the Government's amendment.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_436">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1634">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The amendment that has been moved by the Minister for Finance "notes that the Government has taken determined and decisive action to restore, through the Bank Guarantee Scheme, Recapitalisation and otherwise, the health and reputation of the financial system".  In recent weeks and months, the Government has been deeply involved at every level in trying to ensure the financial viability of this country and the strength of its banking system.  Some of the commentary from outside and inside the House has been unhelpful.  There has been a change in that regard lately, however.  People have started to realise that as we are in this together, we need to address these problems in a coherent manner.  We need to pull together to put measures in place to stabilise this country's financial system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">Some of the commentary on the problems in Ireland has been inward-looking.  Some comments have been made solely in the context of the Irish situation.  This is an international problem, however.  It originated in the sub-prime market in the United States and has spread across the whole world.  Every country with a modern financial system is creaking under the pressure.  Ireland is no different.  When people criticise the actions that are being taken, they should do so on the basis of facts rather than in the context of a partisan approach that involves trying to undermine the Government's credibility.  People are speaking about Ireland's financial difficulties without reflecting on the global challenges that are visiting these shores.  They are talking about coming together in a bipartisan spirit, but I wish their deeds would reflect their words and commentaries.  Over the next few weeks, I urge everybody to be supportive during what is a fundamentally difficult time not just for the Government but also for every man, woman and child in the country.  There is a great deal of fear.  People are worrying about their jobs and the potential loss of their homes.  That is why Deputies on this side of the House are trying to ensure there is integrity in the banking system.  The Minister for Finance spoke about regulation in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">Fundamentally and importantly, the most immediate issue we face is the need to bring stability to our financial and banking systems.  The first decision that was taken involved the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme.  That was a very brave and historic decision, because if we did not do it, there could have been a big fall back in Irish banking.  Every outside commentator recognises that.  It was disappointing that we did not get full support in the House, but I believe that as time goes on, it will be shown to have been the right decision.  It gave the Government the opportunity and the breathing space to deal with the banks in a structured manner with regard to recapitalisation and risk management.  Time was needed for this, and the bank guarantee allowed that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">There are myths and rumours which claim that the Government is shoring up the banks.  The Government is ensuring that we have a viable banking sector that can ensure a flow of credit to small and medium-sized businesses.  We now have a code of practice in that area and in the area of mortgage arrears.  Equally, we have ensured an availability of credit to first-time buyers, so that there might be some stimulation of the economy.  These are critically important issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">It was very interesting to listen to Mr. Peter Sutherland today, a man who everybody in this House would hold in very high esteem.  He brought some sense and reality to the debate on the challenges facing Ireland.  I urge others to listen to his views and his expressions of concern that we could undermine the credibility of the country by inflammatory comment and by the partisan approach that is doing nothing for the credibility of the banking system in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">There is much anger out there about the remuneration of bank executives.  I accept that is something which is causing great concern among the public.  It is causing anger, hurt and betrayal.  We cannot prejudice the outcome of any investigations of wrongdoing or perceived wrongdoing.  We must leave the law of the land, as passed by these Houses, to take its course.  Those that are charged with the responsibility of enforcement should be allowed the freedom to do so without any interference or commentary that could jeopardise those investigations.  I urge others not to use that in order to beat up the Government.  They are doing themselves and the people they represent a disservice.  The economy will slow down, there will be job losses, and we will find it difficult to resurrect it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">There is no doubt that being in the eurozone has helped us weather the storm so far.  The fact that we are at the heart of Europe has assisted us in being part of a stable currency.  The other challenges that people conveniently forget is the pressure on our exporters into the sterling and dollar areas.  These problems have put us at a huge financial disadvantage.  The commentary is a little simplistic, distilling the debate down to a few people in the banking system who are alleged to be the cause of all difficulties.  There is anger at those bankers, and rightly so, but the solution is not there.  The solution is for this House to pull together, make sure we all wear the green jersey and put forward a positive view that Ireland is dealing with its challenges.  We need bipartisanship in one area of fundamental national interest, which is to resolve the financial difficulties of the banking situation.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1641">I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Government amendment to this motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">Those responsible for inflicting such serious damage on the Irish banking system in recent times must be held to account before the full rigours of the law.  Based on what has been publicly disclosed, the events at Anglo Irish Bank are nothing short of a national scandal.  These events included the concealment of the directors' loans, the deliberate propping up of the share price following the unwinding of the contracts for difference, as well as the €7 billion window dressing of its customer deposit base at year end.  During the Celtic tiger years, the Irish banking system was run by a small number of elite executives, who often put self-interest ahead of the country's interests.  In refusing to accept the resignation of its chief executive following exposure of the bank's role in boosting the deposit base of Anglo Irish Bank, the board of Irish Life &amp; Permanent displayed the type of gross arrogance and appalling lack of judgment which has characterised the top echelons of our banking system in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">It is essential that the investigations being undertaken by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Financial Regulator are completed as a matter of absolute priority.  The only way national and international confidence can be restored in our banking system is if there is full accountability for the actions of senior executives involved.  I welcome today's searches by gardaí attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and I look forward to the completion of these investigations and appropriate action being taken.  Deputy Thomas Byrne and I recently wrote to the Garda Commissioner asking that additional resources be made available to assist the director, and I am pleased that eight additional officers have been made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1644">It is clear that some of the transactions at Anglo Irish Bank were completely unethical and, in my view, fraudulent and illegal.  Those responsible must be pursued vigorously.  The competent authorities must do the job they are empowered to do and conclude definitively on these matters.  One measure that would help rebuild confidence in the banking system would be to take a tough line on the level of executive pay.  Imposing a 33% reduction does not go far enough; the Minister must impose an actual cap in pay at a level to which people can relate.  It is not acceptable that senior banking executives are allowed to live in a parallel universe and earn extraordinary amounts of money at a time when the Irish people have come to the rescue of the banks.  The oversight committee is reporting on 5 March and I look forward to the recommendation of the committee and the Minister's final decision on the issue of executive pay.  I am sure he will apply common sense to the level of executive pay and bonuses, which will be capped following the deliberations of the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1645">It is clear that there needs to be a fundamental overhaul of our regulation system.  The reform of the regulation system needs to be brought forward urgently.  The current system has been exposed as flawed and inadequate.  For example, the Financial Regulator's office seriously mishandled the Seán Fitzpatrick loan scandal at Anglo Irish Bank.  In spite of the fact that members of the authority had a series of meetings with Anglo Irish Bank in January 2008, we are led to believe that the chief executive of the authority or any member of the board was not made aware until December 2008 when the Minister informed him.  That is completely unacceptable and shows a serious lack of controls and procedures in place at the offices of the Financial Regulator.  The authority investigated this itself and the resulting report was a whitewash.  I welcome the Minister's intention to bring plans for regulatory reform to the Cabinet, and I believe that the board should be removed as part of that reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">During the Celtic tiger years, the Central Bank time and again highlighted the risks for the Irish economy arising from excessive lending, particularly in the property market, yet the advice provided by the Central Bank was not implemented by the Financial Regulator in its dealings with individual financial institutions.  The role of the regulatory authority is to ensure consumer protection and to foster sound, growing and solvent financial institutions.  The regulator has clearly not implemented the economic policy advice from the Central Bank.  The answer lies in consolidating the functions of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority under a new financial watchdog.  I look forward to reading the Minister's proposals on reform of the regulation system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1647">Ireland needs to have a strong banking system in order to come through this economic recession.  A new banking system needs to emerge from this crisis, and that system needs to be led by executives who recognise their responsibilities to their company, their community and their country.  We need people of principle and conviction at the top echelons of our banking system.  The banks and the Irish economy have a mutually reliant relationship.  We need to get credit back flowing through our economy, and we need to restore trust and confidence in our banking and regulation system as a national priority.  I fully support the Minister in his efforts to achieve that end.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1648">I wish to share time with Deputies Rabbitte and Morgan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">The speech we just heard from the Minister for Finance was, to use an American term, a vanilla ice-cream speech.  It was a vanilla ice-cream speech on banking in which everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.  To add to the sense we have from this Government of panic, dread and confusion, we also have a very valiant attempt by the last three speakers to rewrite history.  How can we have confidence in a Government which brought forward a guarantee at the end of September and the beginning of October at the core of which was the protection of Anglo Irish Bank and which failed, as it confessed, to carry out any due diligence or examination of the bank?</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">It was just a guarantee thrown out there and now we are running away from it.  On that and subsequent nights, I recall Fianna Fáil people saying that Ireland being a first mover on the guarantee was a wonder and a clever move.  We were the smartest kids on the block.  Tonight, the Minister said: "I am firmly of the belief that there is no huge benefit to being first out of the traps with a solution on this issue."  The guarantee at the end of September calls to mind Georgia's invasion of Russia, with the same disastrous consequences for the Irish economy that the invasion had for the Georgians.  The kind of backtracking we have heard from the Fianna Fáil speakers here would be laughable if it were not so serious for the tens of thousands of people losing their jobs, the businesses that cannot get credit and those who remain in work in the public or private sector but must pay extra charges, levies and taxes to rescue us form the appalling mess Fianna Fáil has made of our economy and the achievements from which so many of us took pleasure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">Regarding the toxic ten — the golden circle of the ten people whose names we are not permitted to know — from the various reports over the weekend we know they had loans of €450 million and were given a 25% personal guarantee on that money.  For tax purposes, they will also be able to claim 22% in losses, although we do not know if that is on the entire €451 million or maybe a little less.  I estimate they will get at least €80 million in tax losses, which they can carry forward over the next ten or 20 years or whenever the property market recovers.  The four people named in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, if their names were correct, are prominent people in the property business, three of them in my constituency and, therefore, well known to members of the Minister’s party.  It was most interesting to see that.</p>

They were published in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and would be familiar to most people who have been involved in battling against some bad rezonings on the green belt in my constituency.  If those names are correct they would be better known to members of Fianna Fáil.  The Government has put up a straw man argument on why we are not entitled to know those names.  The only argument it has advanced is that they are customers as well as shareholders, and there is a sacred confidentiality between a bank and its customers.  However, the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that where there is any suggestion of wrongdoing, this confidentiality does not apply.  In this case the wrongdoing is that we had to nationalise the bank, making the taxpayer liable for an incredible amount of guarantee for it.  We have also put our two bigger, essential banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, in mortal danger; witness what has happened to the share price today yet again.  However, we are told we must have confidentiality regarding Anglo Irish Bank.  There was no due diligence before the guarantee and we are then told we cannot have the names.</p>

Protestations of banker-client confidentiality do not arise in this context and the Minister for Finance, as sole shareholder in the bank, should insist this is so.  I draw the attention of the House to section 26 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 which specifies that certain persons, including the chief executive of the Financial Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank, can be required to attend proceedings of relevant Oireachtas committee meetings and provide the committee with such information as it requires in so far as it does not contravene EU legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">On 11 November I had, at my request, a meeting with the then Financial Regulator, Mr. Patrick Neary.  I followed this up because I was very unhappy with the outcome of the meeting and the information.  By then the information about Mr. Quinn was in the public domain.  We now know that throughout 2008 and possibly late 2007 the regulator, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, knew there were serious problems with Anglo Irish Bank.  I asked Mr. Neary if he could explain the role of his office regarding these matters, particularly the insurance company and Anglo Irish Bank.  On 11 November I was told regarding the Quinn insurance company that a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the matter "was undertaken prior to the conclusion being reached that a fine was warranted".  So the regulator and, presumably, whoever he communicated with, knew all about it.  When the Government members offered the guarantee in this House they were either fools or knaves because they and their Taoiseach could not have known that there were serious problems in Anglo Irish Bank, yet they chose not to exercise any due diligence.</p>

He wrote that in addition, the target institution is also obliged to notify the Regulator.  He added that on foot of such a notification the authority is required to determine whether any of those involved in acquiring shares are suitable to be shareholders of the institution in question and that in some cases, where no notification is received, the Regulator may contact the institution to seek confirmation that the transaction does not fall within the foregoing rules and require the institution to have this confirmed by external legal advice. The Government is putting up a straw defence.  Those in the Government and in the previous Fianna Fáil Government have been intimately connected in the affairs of this bank, yet the Government continues to withhold the names from the Dáil and, more importantly, from the people of Ireland who are about to be increasingly pauperised, whether public servants or private servants, by the failures of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1676">It would work more effectively than the current one and that would not be a big challenge to any of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">I do not doubt for a moment that economic students of the future will look back with dismay at this period of Irish history, especially when they see that the Government had this report in its possession for five months before the Garda raided this bank to gather evidence before it was all removed or destroyed.  In such circumstances anyone out who has self-incriminating evidence and five months to clear it would be very foolish to be caught.  However, it is good to see that at long last some movement has occurred, but it is bizarre in the extreme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The reason the Garda, and all these corporate enforcement officials such as the Financial Regulator, did not act until now is that the prevailing assumption was that one should not touch the banks.  There was an assumption that these were the gods of the Celtic tiger and they cannot be seized upon and must be allowed do whatever they want.  This really was amazing because everybody on this side of the House has stated for some considerable time that Anglo Irish Bank was a toxic bank.  Even before we knew the detail of the toxic loans, and some of the surrounding activities, we were saying that a receiver should have been sent in to the bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">Some on this side of the House also stated that it may take a period of five years to address the situation but the Government did not listen.  The Government knew more about this than we did.  The Government had information about the toxic loans, and yet sat on its hands.  I find that bizarre in the extreme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The public is punch drunk with this entire episode.  An article last Sunday in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reported that the then Regulator, the person in charge of ensuring that the banks were honest and acted with proper probity, told the bank, when advise it would be engaging ins some creative accounting practices, to continue with its operations.  That is bizarre in the extreme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">What happened to the Financial Regulator?  Rather than being called in and carpeted, rather than be told that he was a disgrace and have him sacked he was sent off with a golden handshake of €630,000 and given an annual pension of €142,000.  Many people are asking me was that golden handshake a reward to keep him quiet and not to disclose other pieces of information in his possession, and to keep him from putting them into the public domain.  I do not know but people are well justified in asking those questions.  It looks odd, to say the least.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">There have been other details.  There is the €450 million that was given out to the six customers, the €6 billion transfers between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, which was very dubious activity and the €180 million in loans to directors.  The report, I understand, stated that the bank has very large exposures, an understatement if ever there was one.  That information should have been given to those of us on this side of House before we voted on the nationalisation of the bank last January.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">With regard to the nationalisation of the bank, is the Government aware of any Members of this House, including Ministers, who had shares in Anglo Irish Bank and who did not declare them before voting on the nationalisation Bill in January and if so, does that represent a conflict of interest?</p>

            <p eId="para_1685">If it emerges somebody here had shares in Anglo Irish Bank, does that mean that their vote on the Bill was null and void?  I am no lawyer but it looks deeply suspicious.  I find it strange that nobody here had any shares in the bank.  I can assure the House that none of my colleagues holding the Sinn Féin seats here had shares in it or any other bank.  The Government should have told us the true state of this bank before we voted and then we would have been able to represent much more constructively those taxpayers and members of society who we are sent here to represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">The 120,000 people who marched in this city on Saturday afternoon last did not just march against the pension levy and the wage cut.  They marched to impress upon the Government to move away from its carry-on of protecting the speculators, the corrupt bankers and that strata of society, and ignoring people.  It is fair to bring all the toxic information regarding the banks before the House.  Whatever about the markets, the bankers, the Government policies and the speculators are the people who have destroyed our reputation internationally.  It was not Opposition Members who are trying to hold the Government to account, as they are not only entitled, but obliged, to do in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Those people were marching on Saturday afternoon last to change Government policy back to a position where there is some kind of a caring society created, where this is not all faced in the direction of the filthy rich and of that culture of corruption with the elite, and rather to turn it round to deal with those workers on low and middle incomes, for example, to deal with the cervical cancer immunisation programme costing approximately €9 million and which has been abandoned.  It looks to society that the only people benefiting here are the bankers and the filthy rich, and as for the rest of society, they can go to heck and do not matter.  That is grossly unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The banks lending policy was a joke.  The regulator, the Central Bank and the Government should have reined in this but not one of them did.  I had a case in my constituency office a few weeks ago of a 54 year old man in very poor health who went to a bank at 50 years of age and was given a 20 year mortgage.  He was a tradesman in the construction sector and was expected to work until he was 70 years of age to pay back that loan.  He is now about to lose his home and he is distraught.  In my book, the lending institution was at least as culpable as the man was foolish for taking out such a huge loan.  It is a disgrace that the banks are getting away with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">There is an absolute necessity to create a credit stream that will run from the banks to small and medium enterprises.  Not only do viable businesses depend on that, the jobs therein are also crucial.  We know the cost of unemployment to the Exchequer and the business case that can be made for a credit stream without any of the social issues being included, so I hope the Government will recognise that and put something in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1690">Prior to the previous adjournment of the debate, I outlined that international research since the 1890s shows that there is an increase in suicide and mental health issues during times of recession.  I request that the Government allocates €8 million to the National Suicide Prevention Office to deal with that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">There is a precedent for this.  Some weeks ago the Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced that €7.8 million was being provided to organisations involved in marriage and child bereavement counselling services throughout Ireland as a first part of a three-year rolling investment in the valuable services provided by those organisations to support families in times of distress and trauma.  The psychological stresses should be addressed in a similar fashion.  The Minister stated that now more than ever there is a need to ensure the quality of services available to help families who may be experiencing new pressures and stresses in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">The difficult economic situation being experienced throughout the country is filtering into the lives and homes of families throughout Ireland.  When a person loses his or her job or has working hours cut, the financial strain can lead to pressures in relationships and on his or her mental health and well-being.  The Minister for Health and Children must deal with the situation in the same way as the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has dealt with the pressures on relationships.  She also stated that having a network of support services available throughout the country to provide marriage and relationship counselling services is a core part of helping families to cope with problems they are confronted with.  Having a network of support services available throughout the country to provide mental health and suicide prevention services is a core part of helping families to cope with problems they are confronted with as a result of the recession and the effect it will have, as proven by international research in every decade since 1890, and the fact that those rendered unemployed are six times more likely to commit suicide than the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1693">I call on the Minister to respond to the request to treat the levels of mental well-being and psychological stresses in the way the Minister for Social and Family Affairs dealt with marriage difficulties and family relationship problems.  The same applies to mental health and well-being and suicide prevention, and recognising that the recently unemployed have a higher level of suicide.  We must promote suicide prevention programmes aimed at those people and the avenue to do that is the National Suicide Prevention Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">Before Christmas we met the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and Professor Drumm and they informed us they had recognised this and would increase the level of money to the National Suicide Prevention Office, but recent rumours have been circulating that the office may have to take a 10% cut in its budget.  If that happens, the Government and the Minister are in denial about the real situation confronting people in terms of psychiatric and emotional difficulties and levels of suicide in families as a result of the recession.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1695">We are debating this legislation on Second Stage but only 20 minutes ago in this Chamber, Deputy Joan Burton made statements about the alleged involvement of Fianna Fáil in Anglo Irish Bank.  She started saying this only last week, when the Opposition was smearing us.  It is a lie that Fianna Fáil was intimately involved with Anglo Irish Bank over the last few years.  Most of us had never come across that bank, unlike other Members of the House on the Opposition benches who were substantially involved with it for a number of years in terms of share holdings.  That lie is incorrect and is unfair on Fianna Fáil Members who have not come across that bank and were delighted to see the gardaí investigating it today.  It is important that Fianna Fáil fights back and rejects these accusations being made conveniently by the Labour Party when it should be offering economic solutions to the problems we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">This Bill is such a solution.  It is a difficult Bill and will have consequences for the many public servants affected by it.  Any of the public servants I deal with are hard working and committed to doing a good job, including people who work for Meath County Council and the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">When we debate this legislation, however, it is important to read the preamble to the Bill, which sets out in stark terms the difficulties the country faces.  It notes that a serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State have occurred which threaten the well-being of the community.  Legislation does not include a preamble of that nature without good cause.  That is the nature of the situation we face and if we do not face up to it there will more serious trouble in the economy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">The next paragraph of the preamble states that as a consequence, a serious deterioration in the revenues of the State has occurred and there are significant and increasing commitments in respect of public service pensions.  It is therefore necessary to cut current Exchequer spending substantially to demonstrate to the international financial markets that public expenditure is being significantly controlled to ensure continued access to international funding, to protect the State's credit rating and reverse the erosion of the State's international competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">These are serious matters the legislation seeks to address.  As a result of our deficit, we are dependent on our access to international funding and the maintenance of our credit rating.  That view does not seem to be shared by the Opposition.  However, if we cannot do those things, we cannot borrow the money and employ public servants because we are borrowing almost the entire amount of public service pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">No one wants to place this imposition on anyone.  However, the imposition on those in the private sector who have lost their jobs, although some in the public sector have lost their jobs, is far more serious than for anyone who has to take a pay cut.  That is not to underestimate the serious and substantial difficulties people face when they take a pay cut, particularly those on lower incomes.  We have quite a progressive taxation system in this country.  According to the Department of Finance, a single person on €25,338 per annum will pay, including this pension levy, 13% of his or her gross income in total deductions to the Revenue. That is a person on the modified PRSI rate.  A person earning €66,179 in the public service, which is not three times the previous figure, will pay 33% of his or her gross income in total deductions to the Revenue Commissioners.  In money terms, however, the difference is that the person on €25,000 will pay €3,193 — that is total deductions, including tax, PRSI, the pension levy and the 1% levy.  However, the person on €66,000 will pay €21,897.  There is more than a seven times difference in the cash payment, whereas the salary is not three times different.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">We have a significantly progressive system and it is not true to say we do not have a progressive taxation structure.  We have a very progressive one, although it certainly could be improved.  I would have no objection to people earning six-figure salaries receiving tax increases in this year's budget.  The reality is, however, that the money that will come in from people earning more than €200,000 will not be as significant as a broad-ranging tax increase, which may have to happen later in the year.  Those figures and others, which are available on the Department of Finance website, indicate the progressive nature of our taxation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">We have a low level of taxation and there are few economies where one's taxation contribution could be as low as 13%.  Let us call a spade a spade because PRSI and the two levies are all tax paid to the Government out of one's wages for services provided and benefits received.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">A single person earning €66,179 will be on 33% of his or her gross income, which is much less than many other countries charge.  A married one-earner couple — there may be more of them with rising unemployment — on €66,179 pays only 27% of gross income in taxation.  That compares very well to other countries.  We must nail this myth that somehow we are a high tax country, because we are a low income tax country compared to other jurisdictions.  That is not to say, however, that the income tax burden does not impose difficulties on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1704">Deputy Burton was also guilty of confusing the pension levy with bank recapitalisation, in saying that somehow one's pension levy will go to the banks to pay for the recapitalisation.  That is a myth that has been put about by many Opposition spokespersons and others around the country.  They say that somehow this levy is directly connected to the bank recapitalisation, but I suggest it is the other way around.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">The pounding the world financial system, including our own banks, is receiving has resulted in a huge decline in revenues for us and is causing major difficulties in the economy.  The bottom line is that if we do not recapitalise, the banks will not be able to lend.  Now that we are doing so, the banks have given a commitment that they will lend money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">People do not seem to realise that the recapitalisation moneys, apart from the various conditions the Minister for Finance has attached to them, are basically a loan.  The Minister expects something in the order of €560 million in interest payments in the first year.  One of the banks said it would aim to pay back sooner because of that.  That can create difficulties for the banks, but that is the condition we have put on it.  It is not that the pension levy is going straight into the recapitalisation figure, however, so that myth must be nailed.  The pension levy is really there to shore up the public finances and it must be done.  If we do not do that we might as well all go home because we will not have funding to do anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">A lot of hardship will be endured because of the pension levy.  The various rates come from the table in section 2 of the Bill, whereby any remuneration up to €15,000 is deducted at 3%.  Any excess between €15,000 but under €20,000 is deducted at 6%, and any amount over €20,000 is deducted at 10%.  That is not to say that all one's income over €20,000 will be deducted at 10%, although unfortunately some people think it will be.  That position has been represented to me by concerned constituents.  I was contacted by a number of constituents in the HSE who got information that the rate for incomes over €20,000 was 10%.  While they are not happy with the situation, they were relieved to discover that the rate was not 10% unless they are earning at the higher rates where it goes up to about 9.9%.  That would apply to Ministers and TDs who will be on about 9% of their overall income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">Some people do not realise the tax situation involved which has the same effect as a pay cut, in that the deduction will be on gross pay and not on the net amount.  The deduction on the net amount will be significantly less.  It is nonetheless a serious imposition, but a necessary one for the Government to get the public finances back in order and to provide State services.  The Minister could easily have cut back on services, including schools and hospitals, by abolishing the capital programme.  We would have no deficit problem then, but the consequences for the economy would be so serious that we would have even more unemployment.  In addition, we would have even less infrastructure being prepared for when the international economy turns.  With bad news every day, one wonders if it will ever turn around, but it is assumed it will.  The international economy had better turn for our sake because we are totally dependent on international finance and our reputation abroad.  We must demonstrate that we have the financial wherewithal to weather this storm, keep things under control and ensure our national debt, which comes from a low base, does not increase any more than is projected by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1712">This Bill does not actually impose a pension levy on public servants, rather it imposes a pay levy on persons who are participants in certain State superannuation schemes.  Therefore, the reference to pensions is to define the category to which the pay cut applies.  It is not a pension levy as cans be seen when one reads through the Bill.  These persons derive no additional pension benefit from the levy, which is imposed at levels of 3%, 6% and 10%, depending on income.  The levy is on net rather than gross income and applies to all income, including overtime.  This proves again that it has nothing to do with pensions because overtime is not reckonable for pension purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">It has all the signs of being a rushed scheme.  We have heard various anecdotes from meetings of the social partners, but the internal evidence of what is presented to us looks as if it was rushed.  When questioned in the Dáil, the Taoiseach stated that the levy applied to gross income.  Three hours later on television, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said it applied to net income and that seems to be the current position.  This fact does not seem to have been taken into account, however, when the scheme was designed.  It is claimed to be progressive in nature, with those on higher income paying more.  When tax relief is allowed some persons on higher income, on the higher rate of tax, will pay less in percentage terms than persons on lower income and on the standard rate of tax.  Any competent set of civil servants designing this scheme would not have fallen into that kind of trap unless they were working on the basis, in the first instance, that it applied to gross income.  It appears, therefore, that those who designed the scheme meant it to apply to gross income and when this was changed to net income no amendments were made to eliminate the distorting impact of the higher tax rate on the progression of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">Further evidence that the original intention was gross income is in the calculations of savings announced by the Cabinet.  There is a difference of €500 million between applying the levy on net rather than gross income.  Yet the announcement claimed savings of €1.4 billion from the levy when the actual figure was €500 million less.  I do not know if the change took place between the Taoiseach's answer in the Dáil and the Minister's appearance on television.  It shows, however, the signs of hastiness — a dirty hurry.  Things done in a dirty hurry are always inexact and inequitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">This levy is unfair as it singles out public servants without any impositions on other persons in the community who are far wealthier than the nurses, the teachers, the gardaí, the prison officers, the local authority workers and the civil servants.  I cannot understand how experienced politicians, who above all else pride themselves on their political skills, could have introduced a levy which applies to such a narrow range of hard-working people in our community while allowing others, the principal beneficiaries from the excesses of the Celtic tiger boom, to walk away scot free.  The Minister for Finance has suggested that next December's budget will be harsh and taxes will be increased.  The tax increases will apply to public servants the same as they will apply to the bankers and those who made exorbitant profits out of the economy when the going was good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">The public service did not cause the financial and fiscal crises in which the country is mired.  Certain wealthier sections of society are largely to blame for that.  In the interests of social cohesion, they must share some of the burden being imposed upon public servants.  While public servants have a contribution to make to the solution of our fiscal problems, they did not cause them and they played no part in the main events that caused the economy to crash.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">The levy is particularly harsh on the lower paid.  Many Members on both sides of the House believe that should be amended.  The word "tweak" has been used; the Bill needs a bit more than tweaking.  A salary of €15,000 is too low to commence paying the levy.  If the Minister were to design it again, a starting salary of €25,000 would be more appropriate.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to use his influence to have an amendment introduced on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">After the Long Title, there is a recital referring to the fiscal situation, the difficulties the economy is experiencing, the State's credit position, Exchequer spending and so forth.  I believe this recital has been included on the Attorney General's advice to proof the Bill from a legal or constitutional challenge as it is effectively the appropriation of people's pay which would run into constitutional difficulties.  One can protect oneself from such a challenge when it is put in the context of the public interest with all the dire events in the economy.  While I accept the Attorney General's advice must be taken, one part of the recital states, "whereas the burden of job losses and salary reductions in the private sector has been very substantial and it is equitable that the public sector should share that burden ...".  It is outrageous the Government decided to write into the Bill a provision which points to social division, playing the public sector off against the private sector.  If the Minister wanted to make that debating point, he should have done so in his introductory speech not in the text of the Bill.  When it goes to Committee Stage, the Minister must remove this wording.  If he wants to counterpoint in society, he should counterpoint the rich against the poor, the influential against the powerful.  He should not counterpoint public servants against those losing their jobs in the private sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1719">The one aspect of this legislation that everyone remarks upon is its unfairness.  They should not be too surprised about that, however.  While Fianna Fáil claimed it had all the political craft over the years, it recently made two mistakes and unfair decisions.  The first mistake was during the budget when it imposed a 1% levy across the board from those earning €17,000 per annum to those earning €99,000.  The Government then spent the next two months apologising to the various groups for this mistake.  The Government has now compounded this mistake by stampeding the electorate into believing there was no other way of introducing a levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">A common theme running through today's Fianna Fáil contributions on Leaders' Questions, the Order of Business and this debate is that the Opposition is guilty of high treason.  Somehow or other, the country's problems would not be as bad except for the Opposition.  What hypocrisy.  Over the past ten years, the construction bubble sucked in everyone in the Government to the point they could not see night from day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721">It was the Government that should have regulated the banks.  In the past ten years if an Opposition Member raised an issue concerning a bank or banker in the House, the Taoiseach, or his predecessor, would say, " How dare you speak about the banks".  The banks were allowed to run riot.  Now, it suits the Government to nail the banks.  What happened in the banking world is nothing short of atrocious.  Who allowed them to get away with it?  The Government.  There was more regulation in an ordinary credit union down the country than there was in the national banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">Last week, public representatives had an important meeting in Ballinasloe, County Galway with several hundred members of IMPACT.  They comprised nurses and local authority workers who will all be unfairly hit by the levy.  One after another stood up to explain how the levy would economically affect them.  If the Minister believes this was the only fair way to tackle this problem, despite the other economic problems we have, then he, and the Government, have no brains.  There is something lacking at the core of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1723">Many Members have said, including Government backbenchers when they are down the country, there is a fairer way of introducing this levy.  We all appreciate we are in a bad economic situation but the Government must stop turning the gun on people who had nothing to do with creating it, as Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1724">Many public servants will pay dearly for this levy without gaining any extra pension rights.  They are in fact subsidising a group in society which played holy hell over the past ten years.  That group took the money and ran while the Government will ensure those on low and middle incomes will pay for them.  When 120,000 people took to the streets of Dublin last Saturday, the good wishes of another 2 million people were with them.  There were many reasons more people could not attend but, by any standards, it was a huge march.  Numerous individuals wished they could have been present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1725">Of all the legislation that has ever been passed by the House, this Bill will be remembered for a long period.  We are fully aware that the State must make savings of €2 billion this year and a great deal more next year.  However, it is the way in which this is being done that has led to protests.  The Bill is ill-timed and not well thought out.  On 4 June, the Government will rue the mistake it made in introducing it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1726">IMPACT held a meeting in Wicklow last night and the message that came across is that people in general and public sector workers in particular want to know the truth.  They wish to know the extent of the problem.  They are terrified that this is not the end and that when higher taxes are introduced, either later in the year or in the budget, they will be hit again.  As previous speakers stated, these people are strongly of the view that they did not cause the downturn in the economy.  Meanwhile, those who should be held accountable are getting away scot free.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">In the Government amendment to Fine Gael's Private Members' motion, the issue of capping the salaries of those who run the banks that are seeking recapitalisation has been overlooked.  There is no doubt that the motion, as amended, will be passed by the House tomorrow evening.  Most people would consider annual salaries of €250,000 for those in the banking sector who caused the problems we are facing as being more than generous.  However, all the Government is doing is imposing a 25% cap on those who earn €2 million or €3 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">In concluding his speech on budget day last October, the Minister for Finance stated that the budget was "no less than a call to patriotic action".  If ever legislation was designed to divide the country, it is that currently before the House.  As Deputy Noonan indicated, the preamble to the Bill refers to sharing the burden.  I accept that many in the private sector have lost their jobs and that public sector jobs are somewhat more secure.  However, there is no doubt that those in the public service were prepared to play their part in assisting the process of making cuts in public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">Last week the Committee of Public Accounts issued a report on FÁS, which has a budget of €1 billion.  The report indicates that €35 million of this was spent on advertising.  In addition, it states that some procurements and tenders were not appropriate.  The committee made a recommendation which, if the legislation had permitted, would have been stronger.  This matter could have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to carry out an investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">On the day on which the Garda fraud squad raided the bank the Government nationalised, this legislation, which will oblige people earning €15,000 per annum to pay a pension levy of €400, is being debated.  It is not correct to state — as did Deputy Thomas Byrne — that people earning €25,000 will only pay a percentage.  The money in question will be deducted from these people's essential daily incomes.  Those on higher incomes have somewhat more flexibility and it is, therefore, not fair to say this measure is weighted in favour of the lower paid.  Those on lower pay should not be subject to the levy.  The latter would only be fair and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">As already stated, people want to be told the truth.  They also want leadership.  We want to know the extent of the problem in order that we might provide assistance in dealing with it.  People want to hear those who have been in power for so long stating that not everything they did in the past was correct and that they have made mistakes.  It seems to be beyond the members of the current Administration to acknowledge the shortcomings they have displayed while in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">I wish to provide an example of the Government's short-sightedness.  When announcing the cuts of €2 billion, the Taoiseach stated that €300 million in savings would be achieved in respect of the capital programme as a result of the submission of more competitive tenders.  He indicated that work on certain projects could be done for 20% less.  I suggest that the €300 million in savings to which he referred could be used to achieve 20% extra for the economy.  For example, if it were used to keep 5,000 people in employment, an additional €50 million would accrue to the Exchequer as a result of their paying €10,000 each in income tax.  In addition, this would lead to €20,000<i>per capita</i> — a total of €100 million — being saved in unemployment benefit payments.  Therefore, half the €300 million in savings to which the Taoiseach referred would have been obtained before savings were even achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">A nursing home in Bray, County Wicklow, has been obliged to close down because it constitutes a fire hazard for older people.  It will cost €10,000 per week — €500,000 per year — to place those who lived at the home into outsourced beds.  If this was replicated at 50 other locations throughout the country — which could easily be done — the total saving would amount to €100 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">The example of FÁS highlights that a black hole exists in the context of there being too many members on boards.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the board of FÁS be reduced from 17 to nine members.  In addition, FÁS has a number of sub-committees, committees to oversee expenses, etc.  As an organisation, it is all over the place.  The approach of keeping everybody happy must be brought to an end.  We should have explored what could be done in this regard before attacking those who earn €15,000 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735">Retained firefighters, who work on a part-time basis, have not been able to obtain an answer as to whether the levy will apply to them.  At the end of their period of service, these individuals obtain a gratuity rather than a pension.  However, they cannot obtain a simple answer whether the levy will be imposed on them.  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to retained firefighters, not least those who serve in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1736">What the country needs, if it is to encourage people to pull together, is a thriving private sector which can pay for an efficient and progressive public sector.  There is no doubt that the public sector requires reform because it has become too large.  However, what is being done by means of this Bill should have been done in a way that is fair to everyone.  Fair play is what is required but it will not be achieved as a result of the passage of this legislation.  I urge the Minister for Finance to consider the amendments that will be tabled by the Opposition on Committee Stage because they will be aimed at assisting the country in addressing the financial challenges it faces.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_1737">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  There is little doubt that the economic situation in which the country finds itself is extremely serious.  As the Minister stated, the country is facing its greatest challenge in 70 years.  Based on what has been said by previous speakers, there seems to be a consensus building among people that we must work together and try to find common ground.  We all have a common purpose and the vision that should accompany it must focus on achieving an acceptable level of fiscal rectitude.  The term "fiscal rectitude" has not been heard for many years.  In the 1980s when Ireland experienced similar but probably not as severe difficulties, people found it in themselves to work together to try to bring to reality the notion of a balanced budget.  We have not been obliged to achieve a balanced budget for a long period.  We have enjoyed budget surpluses, some of them significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1738">The scale of the problem we face has been exaggerated by the speed at which the downturn occurred.  In a two-year period, we have moved from having a considerable surplus to dealing with a deficit of almost €18 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">Consensus was achieved in 1987 following seven, eight or perhaps nine years of failed policies on all sides.  People had failed to face up to the severity of the problem, to the serious issues that needed to be addressed and to the obvious and tough decisions which had to be made.  Placing it in context, what occurred over seven years in the 1980s has effectively happened again in a seven-month period.  The Government has been obliged to assist the public in understanding the reality that we have moved from a position of surplus to one of significant deficit and that severe economic measures are needed to address the problems that exist.  Much has been achieved in this relatively short period in terms of the changes, including in the public mood, which have taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">The loss of jobs is the element that creates the greatest concern.  Notwithstanding this concern, which we all share, the sentiments expressed and the level of hysteria displayed in some quarters would lead one to believe that 90% of the workforce was unemployed and the remaining 10% was in employment.  Although the opposite is the case, negative perceptions have assisted the downward spiral of the recession and could, if we are not careful, lead us into a depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_1741">We must be balanced in our comment.  While recognising the difficulties that lie ahead, we cannot allow commentary to exaggerate the problem to the extent that we instil unwarranted fear in the minds of many people.  We are all aware of people, many of whom are recession proof, who decided not to purchase various items this year.  Without wishing to understate the severity of the problems we face, balance is needed in the debate to ensure we do not further expose the economy to stress and undermine our capacity to return to a minimal level of growth in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">Under the Government plan, we could have a balanced budget in 2013.  The decisions which will be needed in the next four years to achieve this objective will be significant and the resultant measures will cause considerable pain for many people.  Members must be mindful of this and must share the pain.  We will be affected by the measures set out in the legislation and I expect we will continue to share the burden in the same way as we expect others to share it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">Of the Government's expenditure requirement of €55 billion for this year, €20 billion will be expended on pay and pensions and a further €20 billion on social welfare.  It is vital that we continue to support the most vulnerable in society.  While we are under considerable strain and pressure through our financial commitments and the requirement to fund various State activities, it is important to maintain the progressive nature of our social welfare support system.  We cannot allow ourselves to be deflected from ensuring that those who are caught in the poverty trap receive assistance.  It has been suggested in some quarters that the social welfare budget should be examined.  Given that no one in receipt of social welfare has an easy ride, we must be careful in this respect and ensure any such action is taken as a last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">We must continue to fund the back to education programme to ensure we continue to assist those who have not had an opportunity to escape the poverty trap or have been unable to enter or return to the employment market.  This will be more difficult in the current circumstances because significant numbers of jobs are being lost, including among skilled employee groups and professions.  The loss of these types of jobs makes it more difficult for those without skills to find gainful and meaningful employment.  It is important, therefore, to provide appropriate housing and assistance for those who belong to this section of society to give them some quality of life, while at the same time maintaining a focus on breaking the cycle of long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">We must work towards the removal of the social isolation and deprivation which has bedevilled some elements of society, in particular those who did not see the benefits of the Celtic tiger.  It would be a misrepresentation to argue that these people did not benefit from the Celtic tiger given that it provided the State with resources needed to establish a progressive social welfare system.  Clearly, therefore, the Celtic tiger benefited those in receipt of social welfare.  While they may not have succeeded in entering employment, they have benefited from the progressive social welfare programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">It is also important to place in context the progress made through economic activity in recent years.  We must try to trace the origins of the economic downturn.  Certain statements made in the House, other fora and a variety of publications amount to misrepresentations.  Nothing could be further from the truth than the notion that the Government, in concert with a number of bankers and assisted by a number of property developers, caused the current problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">A few years ago, we were all pleased that there was competition in the banking sector and we could all recount stories of the bad old days when the banks charged penal interest rates of 18%, 19% and 20%.  We talked about the difficulties this created in a bygone era when farmers struggled to buy land to improve their lot and provide a livelihood for their families.  We heard stories about bankers creating problems for those seeking to purchase a home by taking a stuffy approach, showing disregard for the common man and woman.  We heard about bankers who refused to help people who needed money as they sought to ensure only a small elite group had the capacity to borrow.  All this changed as a result of competition in the banking sector.  As interest rates were reduced and money was made available, many people who would not otherwise have had an opportunity to do so found they could participate in the property sector.  This is not to deny that a culture developed in the banking sector which allowed elements to engage in wrongdoing.  Nevertheless, the motivation in the early stages, when a number of smaller banks emerged, was to bring about competition and ensure people were able to participate in society in a way they had not done in the past.  Many people benefited from this development but we now have a certain degree of amnesia as people forget where the banking cycle started.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748">One of the fundamental mistakes or element of wrongdoing is to allow those involved in lending to do so on the basis that they will gain a significant bonus from arranging a loan.  This removes the discretion and clear-mindedness required to ensure the risk being assumed is properly assessed by the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">The Minister has established a committee to examine remuneration among the higher echelons of the banking sector.  In establishing appropriate levels of remuneration, cognisance must be taken of the bonuses available to banking staff who arrange loans or generate lending activity.  This issue must be examined because it is not appropriate that bank staff should be remunerated on the same basis as a store assistant who is rewarded on the basis of the number of pairs of shoes, handbags or suits he or she sells.  Bank lending is a different world which does not involve commodity trading or sales.  We must, therefore, ensure action is taken on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1750">Accusations have also been made about the manner in which the housing stock was developed.  Not long ago, it was suggested that the supply of housing did not meet demand and the Government was accused of not doing enough to address the problem.  As Members will recall, Dr. Peter Bacon was commissioned to produce a report on the issue.  Based on his recommendations, certain policies were changed and new policies were implemented with a view to increasing supply.  People forget that demands were made to increase the supply of housing to force down prices.  At that time, Opposition and Government Deputies recognised that the lack of supply was causing an increase in house prices.  The issue was then addressed by policy decisions.  We now hear that this approach was wrong and that the Government should not have acted in this manner, notwithstanding the common view at the time that measures were required to remedy the supply problem.  Sometimes intervention works and sometimes it does not.  The market will eventually set the appropriate level.  Clearly, the property market became overheated despite the best efforts of the Government — and indeed the Opposition — in terms of coming forward with valid ideas about controlling the property sector.  The reality is that we can put in place certain controls but they do not always work.  In this case we had an overheated property sector and we are now seeing the market rationalise and set a limit which is more appropriate and perhaps more sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751">In some cases there is considerable hardship associated with the imposition of this levy.  Like every other Deputy in the House, I have been lobbied by various unions and different people whom I know.  The people I have met who are on €40,000, €50,000 or €60,000 a year are just as disturbed as those on €15,000, €20,000 and €25,000.  It is a fact of life that people, particularly those who have a legitimate expectation of a job for life and an expectation that they will retain their salaries based on current trends and expected growth, build a lifestyle around their expectations.  I recognise the major inconvenience, difficulty and burden of trying to restructure the life plans they had in place.  Those of us who are in political life know we are not here for a guaranteed length of time and therefore we do not plan our lives in such an orderly way.  I have great concern and understanding for people who are in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1752">The people I met were at one in terms of their desire to ensure there was equity and, more particularly, that any wrongdoing was rooted out and dealt with in an appropriate manner.  I am not just talking about the banks.  Many people I met were just as concerned about those who find ways of breaching the social welfare code or are self-employed and find ways to obtain financial support for students in college.  Many of them recognised that there would be a necessity to return to payment of college fees, and they wanted equity in terms of how people apply for and receive grants.  There is a perception in some people's minds that there are some who find ways around that.  We need to ensure that whatever safeguards need to be put in place work and appear to work to ensure the confidence of those people who are particularly affected by the introduction of this levy.</p>

The notion of name and shame that was proffered in this House last week is, in my view, an absolute sham.  Criminal wrongdoing must be punished.  It is not just about retribution but about the restoration of the image of Ireland, which has been tarnished by the considerable wrongdoing which has taken place in various financial institutions over a prolonged period.  The systematic deception which is now coming to light must be brought to an end and seen to be brought to an end, and the people responsible for it must be punished in an appropriate way.</p>

We have developed a strong financial sector.  The financial services district is well recognised around the world and the damage that has been done to that by a small number of people has been of such proportion that it has reduced the esteem in which we were held.  This has only been recognised in the current environment.  We must show, for both the domestic and the international community, that we are prepared to take this on.  I have great confidence in the Minister for Finance, particularly with the approach he has taken to ensuring that wrongdoing is found out and that the people associated with it are brought to book and punished in the appropriate way.  I want to see — as do the domestic and international communities — that we have the capacity to root out corruption where it exists, wrongdoing where it has happened and deceit where it resides.  However, our desire to seek results cannot descend into a willingness to placate in a manner that ignores and undermines the foundation stones of our democracy.

The funding being provided to the banks under the recapitalisation plan, while it is perhaps not recognised on the international markets, will provide the necessary liquidity to ensure banks are in a position to continue to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises.  However, we must go further.  From a Government perspective, we must consider imaginative ways to provide tax breaks and mentoring programmes in order that we can instil a sense of entrepreneurial spirit in the people out there who have ideas.  We must be careful about demonising people who have done well over the last number of years.  There has been a desire in the media and among some members of the Opposition to suggest that people who have been successful are, just because they have made money, somehow distasteful or filthy.  If we continue in that way it will be the biggest disincentive to creating the entrepreneurial spirit we need to encourage in people now to ensure they create jobs.

          <p eId="para_1769">I wish to share my time with Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Shortall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770">I welcome today's Garda fraud squad raid on Anglo Irish Bank and I hope, in view of the lapse in time since the scandal in this bank broke, that its members were not met by empty filing cabinets and deleted computer files.  The bank should have been dealt with in this way long since instead of being nationalised, and the names of the Anglo Irish ten — Deputy Dooley, who is just leaving, would not agree with this phraseology — who are associated with the misconduct at that bank should be exposed, whether it is ten or 12 or 15, because I have no doubt we are looking at a number much greater than ten.  They should be named and shamed, and the full facts about their shady deals should be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">Even as the raid was going on we were reading of how a director, now resigned, of Anglo Irish Bank is still receiving fees of €28,000 of taxpayers' money annually for sitting on two State boards, Forfás and Bord na Móna.  This perk from the public purse is more than many low-paid workers currently receive in salary in a year.  Another now resigned Anglo Irish director — Members should remember these are both recent resignations, immediately in advance of the nationalisation proposal — receives €16,846 annually for his role as chair of the Dublin Airport Authority.  In contrast, I commend the more than 100,000 people who marched on the streets of Dublin last Saturday to demand fairness and equity in the measures taken to address the greatest economic crisis we have faced since the 1930s at least.  Some commentators have tried to portray that great mobilisation in a negative light.  It is important that we recognise the justifiable anger that existed on the streets last Saturday.  Who can blame people for their considerable pessimism given the scale of the crisis we are seeing and the prospect that it will get much worse before it gets better?</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">However, there is also a willingness on the part of people to play their part in putting things right and Opposition voices have reflected this over the past several weeks.  Those who marched clearly stated they are prepared to pay their fair share and to work for one another, their families, their communities and this country.  There is a core of true patriotism in these sentiments.  That is also why there is so much deep anger.  We have seen, as we never have before, nakedly exposed greed at the head of the Irish financial system and in the upper echelons of big business.  What is worse, we have seen how this greed, and, to call a spade a spade, criminal greed in some cases, was facilitated or connived at by this State's political leaders and so-called regulators.  As the HSE faces a shortfall of over €1 billion in 2009, we learn of the massive salaries and allowances paid at the top of the HSE, including €16,000 per month for an adviser to the HSE's chief executive, Professor Brendan Drumm.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">It is a misnomer to call what we are discussing this evening a "pension levy".  This is a further tax on all incomes across the board.  It has to be roundly rejected.  People in the public service are willing to make a further contribution, but they will not stand for the imposition of this discriminatory tax.  This is in effect a tax on public service rather than public service pensions.  I reject efforts to divide public sector and private sector workers.  They marched side by side on the streets of Dublin last weekend and, together, they are prepared to face the challenges of restoring this economy to what we hope it to be.</p>

          <p eId="para_1775">This tax, the pension levy, is punitive and unfair.  It allows the rich in society to get away scot-free while lower paid public servants are screwed.  It is a long time since I saw such anger in response to a Government decision and it comes alongside the decision to end special needs education, which affects nearly 600 children, the slashing of the HSE's budget, the debacle of last October's smash and grab on medical cards for those over the age of 70 and much more over the past several months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">Other Deputies have spoken about the hurt that exists and outlined how this levy will impact on public servants.  Given the limited time available to me, I will concentrate on the levy's impact on women, who make up a large proportion of the public sector workforce and a disproportionate number of teachers and nurses.  The Government's proposal will have disproportionate and negative consequences for many of these women because they will never qualify for the full pensions for which they are paying.  This makes a lie of the Government's claim of imposing a pension levy.  It is a pay cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">Over the past few weeks, I have received numerous e-mails from women who left the public workforce to contribute to society in a different but equally valuable way by rearing their children and caring for their other dependants.  One correspondent quit her professional career to rear her three children but her time out of the workforce is not recognised by the Government.  Her contributions towards a State pension will be calculated from when she began working in 1967 until her retirement in 2016, for a total of 47 years, despite the fact that she was not in the workforce between 1972 and 2001.  She will only have 15 years of service when she retires.  Based on her current salary, her pension contribution is €42.82 per week.  Her current pension entitlement is €48.25 per week.  Her new contribution will be €82.99 with no increase to her ultimate pension.  Another correspondent has worked for Offaly County Council since 1994 on a job-share basis in order to take care of her family.  This means she has only 25 years of service.  She pays €1,450 per annum for superannuation but the new levy will cost her €712 net per annum.  I could provide many more examples.  These women have been trying to persuade the Government to see sense.  This measure will disproportionately affect those on the lower earning scales.  No account is taken of ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">I also received correspondence from a staff nurse in the eye and ear hospital who stated that fewer than 5% of nurses and midwives receive a full pension.  Service of 40 years is required for a full pension, which comprises half-pay and a lump sum equalling 1.5 years of salary.  The majority of nurses do not perform 40 years of continuous service because of their studies or child rearing activities.  She wrote that she is not a violent woman by nature and that she pays all her taxes and has never been to prison.  However, she was working a night shift when the Government announced its proposals and found herself walking behind a doctor who she knew earned more than €300,000.  She suddenly realised that he will pay only 1.5% more than her in the levy.  She did not know whether she wanted to inflict an injury on the doctor or the Ministers who are protecting him and themselves by reducing the levy on all those who earn more than €100,000 while penalising those on middle and lower incomes.  The Government still has a chance to do the sensible and decent thing by withdrawing this new tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_490">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1779">I wish to scotch the notion that public sector pensions are a free handout from the tax paying public.  Public sector workers are among the most tax compliant members of our society because the State is their employer and, as a consequence, their tax is directly deductible from their earnings under the PAYE system.  Every euro earned is tax accountable, unlike many others in this society.  Any attempt to brand them as an incubus on the rest of society is wrong.  They are the teachers, nurses, gardaí and civil servants on whom we all depend.  Some enjoy comfortable salaries achieved after enduring a long incremental salary scale, which in the case of teachers is over 20 years, but many have very modest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">Public sector workers make a considerable contribution to their pensions but rather than going into a pension fund, their contributions are used for day-to-day expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">The minimum direct contribution by State employees to their pension is 5% of salary, with an additional 1.5% to cover spouse's and orphan's benefit.  The majority of State employees pay a direct contribution of 6.5% towards their pension, but that is not all.  Since 1995, public sector workers have been required to pay the full PRSI rate, ranging from 4% to 6% of salary.  Unlike workers in the private sector, this will not give them an entitlement to a separate old age pension.  The old age pension will be integrated with the defined benefit, thus reducing their occupational pension by €230 per week on current values.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">There is more.  The second benchmarking report of January 2008 concluded that the pensions of public service groups covered by the benchmarking exercise are significantly more valuable than those in private sector groups and are decided in an arbitrary manner, that public service pensions should be quantified as 12% of salary and that a discount of this amount should be applied when comparing remuneration in the public and the private sector and, accordingly, no increase in salary was recommended for public sector workers.  It is clear that in terms of increases foregone, full PRSI contributions and direct salary deduction, public servants are paying well in excess of 20% of their possible earnings towards pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">What is this pension?  In most cases, it is calculated at one eightieth of retiring salary for each year of paid pensionable service, up to a maximum of 40 eightieths.  While there are some exceptions in respect of the Army, the Garda and firemen, mainline civil servants are required to work until 65 years of age, even though they may have completed 40 years of service before that time.  They will continue to pay into their superannuation scheme even though they will not obtain extra benefit for the extra contributions.  There are, of course, many who will never attain 40 years' service because of late entry to the service. The proposed levy is on top of all this, ranging from 3% on a salary of €15,000 per annum to 9.6% on those earning more than €300,000, of which there are few.  Most relevant is that the levy will be 6.4% on a salary of €35,000 per annum, in addition to the 1% levy already imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">The levy is unfair for many other reasons.  It essentially treats public service pensions as a taxable benefit in kind.  It would make as much sense and would be just as unfair to apply a levy to private sector workers who have company cars and phones or whose health contributions or crèche fees are paid by their employer.  Why not charge Ministers for the use of the Government jet and writers-in-residence or live-in caretakers for the use of facilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_1785">There is also a problem with how the levy disproportionately targets low income workers.  As has been pointed out to me by several of my constituents, the tax treatment of workers as their salary rises into the higher income tax bracket means that the pension levy will represent 4% of gross income for a person on a salary of €510 per week and 2.3% of gross income for a person on a salary of €550 per week.  The levy will be 5% of the gross salary of a person earning €730 per week and 3.7% of the salary of a person earning €800 per week.  In many cases, people on lower incomes will have more deducted from their wages than colleagues on higher wages.  How is that fair?</p>
          <p eId="para_1786">There is a complete lack of clarity in the Bill on whether the levy will apply to temporary or fixed term contract workers in the public service or workers whose length of service is so short they are never likely to have enough contribution years to claim their pension.  Has the Attorney General even been asked for his opinion on the legality of applying a pension levy to non-pensionable income?  We still do not know if the levy will be applied to workers whose income is so low they will never benefit from their contributions.  It would be a gross injustice if people who are already forced to pay worthless contributions are compelled to pay even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">In the circumstances, these proposals are nothing short of outrageous.  This is not an attempt to make a special case for public sector workers or to drive a wedge between public and private sector workers, many of whom have appallingly poor pension provision, it is an attempt to clearly show the injustice of these proposals which target one sixth of the workforce by the imposition of a totally unjust and inequitable levy.  When this levy was announced, neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance seemed to know whether it was to be imposed on gross or net pay.  The proposals had all the hallmarks of having been worked out on the back of an envelope.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">There are still cloudy areas in respect of this levy.  In some areas of public employment special allowances form a considerable part of total remuneration.  These allowances will be liable to the levy but will not be reckonable for pension purposes.  How can the Minister justify such an anomalous position?  To my knowledge, most public sector workers accept that they must make a fair and reasonable contribution to their pensions.  It is clear from what I have said that they are already doing so.  What then is the need for this special levy on the State's employees?  The point must be made that this is not a pension levy, it is a wage cut.  There is no indication that any of the money deducted will go to fund pensions, rather it will be used to bail out an economy that has been bankrupted by builders, bankers and friends of Fianna Fáil who, as of yet, have not been asked to pay a penny in compensation for the damage they have caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">On that point, it was extremely galling to hear a banker say that he expected that his compensation package would be less than €2 million this year.  That is the sort of compensation that might be expected in respect of a life-threatening injury or permanent disability and is more than the lifetime earnings of a worker on the average industrial wage.  This person, who will earn €2 million this year, is not being asked to pay the levy while the Government is taking a €3.5 billion bail-out from the taxes of the ordinary worker.  Modern societies have evolved a system for redistributing wealth.  It is called a progressive tax system.  Those who are rich pay most and those who are poor receive most from the national coffers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1790">When the whole house of cards came tumbling down, the first response of the Government was to remove medical cards from those over 70.  When this did not work and it was compelled to partially back-track and introduce a means test, the Government decided to put a further tax on its employees.  It conspired with its wealthy friends to try to set worker against worker and create further division within our society, but it will not work this time.  The workers in Waterford Crystal and Dell know they have more in common with the teachers, nurses and gardaí they meet every day than with the members of the golden circle who support Fianna Fáil or the wealthy tax exiles who jet in and out and rub shoulders with our leaders in exclusive hotels and private mansions.  The recent survey in <i>The Irish Times</i>  has clearly shown that the penny has finally dropped and that many decent Fianna Fáil supporters have begun to see the light.</p>

          <p eId="para_1802">That is contradictory and shows the lack of any coherence in the Labour Party in Opposition.  One wonders what it would be like in Government.  I wish to address the House on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 as it includes provision under section 17 to effect changes to the early child care supplement.  The early child care supplement was announced in the 2006 budget, as was the decision to create the Office of the Minister for Children, now the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The establishment of that office has been an important development in the delivery of Government policy and services for children and young people because responsibility for all the key areas which affect children and young people, other than school education and health, have been brought together in one office with ministerial input at Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">Deputies will be aware of the constituent elements of my office which include the former national children's office and the area of child welfare and protection.  The child care directorate and the youth justice service, both of which were areas previously under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the areas of early years education and youth affairs from the Department of Education and Science are also located within my office.  Maintaining a general strategic oversight of bodies with responsibility for children's services is also a key area of responsibility for my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1804">As Minister of State with responsibility for these areas, I am aware of the benefits and coherence which the office brings to putting children and young people at the centre of our service delivery.  However, the role of my office in harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice and other areas is not the object of today's debate.  I have referred to it briefly to set the background against which the early child care supplement was introduced in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_1805">The early child care supplement was introduced as a direct, non-taxable, quarterly payment of €250, equivalent to €1,000 per annum.  The purpose of the payment was, and continues to be, to assist parents with the higher costs associated with caring for preschool children.  Payment of the early child care supplement is administered on my office's behalf by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1806">When introduced, the early child care supplement was paid in respect of all children eligible for child benefit who were under six years of age, the rationale being that six is the age at which school attendance becomes compulsory.  The approach taken at that time was the most generous possible to ensure no child would lose eligibility for the payment before starting school.  The payment was increased by 10% in 2008 to €275 per quarter, equivalent to €1,100 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1807">As we are aware, the economic environment has changed radically in recent months and it is necessary to reduce public expenditure and realise savings where possible.  This process began in the 2009 budget which introduced a package of targeted interventions to contribute to the responsible management of the public finances.  Included in these measures was a reduction in the age limit for eligibility for the early child care supplement from six years to five and a half years.  At the same time, the step was taken to change the payment frequency from quarterly to monthly.  In setting a monthly rate, the payment was rounded upwards to €92 per month, bringing the annual payment to €1,104.</p>
          <p eId="para_1808">The changes to the early child care supplement as a result of the budget will result in savings of some €93 million this year and €54 million in a full year.  A greater level of savings arises this year owing to once-off savings of €39 million as a result of the change from quarterly to monthly payments.  The changes to the early child care supplement were made with a view to continuing to target additional support to parents of preschool children.  The same rationale underlies section 17 which provides for further amendments to the early child care supplement to achieve the additional savings required.  In effect, the period of eligibility for the payment will reduce to children aged up to five years, the point at which the majority of children have started school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1809">In addition to providing for a reduction in the age limit for eligibility from five and a half years to five years, section 17 provides for a reduction in the rate of payment from €1,104 per annum to €996 per annum, to be paid in monthly instalments of €83.  The changes to the payment proposed will result in savings of the order of €57 million this year and €77 million in a full year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1810">When it was first introduced in 2006, the supplement was payable in respect of all children eligible for child benefit who were less than six years of age, but the reality is that most children start school at the age of four or five, well in advance of their sixth birthday.  In addition to continuing to oversee the early child care supplement, my office will also continue to provide significant levels of funding to support targeted interventions for disadvantaged children and young people.  Funding in this regard will amount to almost €88 million this year.  Taking account of this investment in children and young people together with the continued payment of the early child care supplement, I am satisfied the necessary amendments proposed in the legislation are targeted to the greatest possible extent given the major challenges facing the economy.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_503">
          <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_1811">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is one of the most important debates to be held in the House since my election in 1981.  Since I entered the House I have witnessed and participated in many debates of major significance to the country and to my constituents.  During these years difficult decisions were taken in the best interests of the people, especially after 1987.</p>
          <p eId="para_1812">After the general election of that year and following the doubling of the national debt, all parties realised we could not continue to spend.  At the time, interest rates were at unprecedented levels and the unemployment rate was spiralling.  A decision was taken by the Government to try to create an economic atmosphere conducive to investment in the country.  Strikes, work stoppages and demonstrations were common occurrences.  There was a slowdown in foreign direct investment to the country.  The Government at that time was a minority Government and I acknowledge that the former Deputy, Mr. Alan Dukes, through the Tallaght strategy was very supportive and put his country before his party.  We created that economic atmosphere and established social partnership.  All those involved in social partnership along with the Government of that time laid the foundation stones for the new economic Ireland.  There followed throughout the 1990s unprecedented economic growth.  Unemployment figures dropped and we almost reached full employment in economic terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1813">Some people may be critical that we did not put more of the surpluses generated throughout the years towards the national debt.  However, those surpluses were used to lower the tax rates.  In the late 1970s the highest rate was 77% and people have forgotten this fact.  The rates have been reduced now to 41% and 20%.  Many surpluses went towards major capital projects, increases in the numbers of public servants, reductions in pupil-teacher ratios and the provision of child care facilities.  If hindsight were foresight then perhaps a further €500 million each year could have been put towards reducing the national debt.  That would have insulated us from the period we are experiencing now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1814">At that time there were substantial net transfers from the European Union, whether for roads, infrastructure, water investment programmes, agriculture or social programmes.  As a Deputy representing a Border county, I am conscious of the role of INTERREG III, the International Fund for Ireland and the peace and reconciliation programme.  Ireland was an Objective One area at the time and I am very proud that the income <i>per capita</i> at the time of our entry into Europe rose from one of the lowest in Europe, that is 55% of the average, to in excess of the average.  Instead of being net beneficiaries we are net contributors to the European Union.  Throughout the period when there were no surplus funds, the Government ensured that matching funds were provided to draw down the maximum funding from Europe.  My peers and I never dreamt that we would experience the 1980s again, or worse.  It is difficult for young people who have experienced the affluence of the Celtic tiger, and a high disposable income because they do not have the 1980s against which to benchmark this experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1815">While there are internal factors at work here we are not immune to the worldwide credit crunch.  We are not immune either to the despicable behaviour of our banks which competed with each other offering loans in excess of 100% to young couples.  I do not blame those young couples while the banks were throwing money around as if it were confetti.  They have contributed to the problem.  Like every other Member of this House I welcome the clear signal sent out today by the fraud squad's entry into Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1816">Recognising the financial situation confronting us the Government acted quickly last summer by making adjustments to the tune of €440 million, the early budget in October, and the decision to find the €2 billion, €1.4 billion of which is coming from the pension-related contribution.  Unfortunately, it appears that much of that will go towards funding the additional people receiving social welfare payments and not to the purpose for which it was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1817">I find in speaking to Members from around the country, meeting with lobby groups and individuals, and reading their e-mails that they are of the view that we all have a responsibility to do something and play a part in turning the economy around.  We all accept that we have a serious problem and that we must play our part.  The people are prepared to do that but in a fair and equitable manner.  There should be no anomalies in this legislation.  Whether we call this a contribution to the pension, a levy, a tax, or whatever, it is a reduction in the income of the public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1818">A fairer and more equitable system, with a broader base, should exist and those responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves, not those who are not responsible, should pay for it.  Is there any point in telling those who must pay a levy from 3% at the low end of the scale to 9.6% at the top, young people or married couples whose children are going to university that this will protect their pensions?  They are not interested in that now.  They are interested in meeting their obligations, whether mortgages, car or education loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1819">The Minister is a fair-minded man.  He and his colleagues in Government must, over the next 24 hours or sooner, examine the anomalies I have detected in this Bill, such as people earning €20,000 being asked to pay 3.8%, or possibly those paying no tax having to pay €750.  Those on much higher incomes will pay less because this is tax deductible.  I hope the Minister will consider that anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1820">There are other people in the country besides civil servants.  I appreciate that the public servants have secure jobs but it is no use telling them that their pensions in 25, 30 or 40 years' time will be secure and that their contribution is lower than that in the private sector.  We should all play our part across the board.  While the public service pension rates are generous they become effective only when the public servants start to draw down their pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1821">I had an opportunity to listen to, and address, a meeting of IMPACT in Donegal last week.  It was interesting to hear people share their personal situations and what their positions would be after this deduction when they are paying crèche or higher education fees and trying to meet their mortgage payments.  This affects not only individuals but also many couples.  It was heart-rending to listen to them share their personal circumstances in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1822">I hope that over the next few hours of debate on Committee Stage the Minister will examine the anomalies in the deduction and do something to broaden its base as quickly as possible.  I have strong views on this matter and it was suggested to me at various meetings that the only way to demonstrate my opposition in principle was to vote against it.  I am realist and a loyal member of my party and I prefaced my remarks wherever I went by saying that whatever I did within the confines of the House I would do within the parliamentary party but would impress my view on Ministers in my bilateral meetings with them.  They are also public representatives as Deputies before becoming Ministers and are aware of the major issues and the problems that everyone in the public service and others are suffering.  I know that the Minister will do his utmost to reduce the impact of this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1823">I fully understand the anger outside the House.  It was palpable at the public meetings which I was pleased to attend because, like other Deputies, I have always described myself as the eyes and ears of the people I represent.  I come from my constituency in south west Donegal, and my county, to impress on the Minister and the Government the seriousness of this for the many individuals affected.  I realise, however, the difficult situation in which the Minister finds himself but let those who have caused this problem suffer and the people will contribute to the resolution.  We will work with the Minister but the method must be more fair and equitable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_1824">The heavy boots of war are on and Ireland is being attacked, not by a foreign aggressor but by its own Government.  The democratic process is under fire.  The voice of the electorate is being ignored and it is time for the people to fight back.  We saw evidence of that last week and will see more tomorrow and the next day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1825">As in all wars, lives will be lost due to lack of medical provision, families will be left homeless, employment will be lost, education will be inaccessible for those with special needs.  The public sector is in the front line of the war, as this Bill is primarily concerned with deductions in the form of a pension levy to be made from the pay-packet of public servants.  This does not, however, apply across the board to everyone in this category.  Last week, under Standing Order 32, I raised the exemption of the Judiciary.  I am fully aware that the remuneration of judges is copper-fastened under the Constitution to protect their independence, which is undoubtedly valid.  I ask the Minister to amend this legislation or the Oireachtas Allowance to Members and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices (Amendment) Act 1997, to allow the Judiciary to join the rest of the public sector in making a contribution at this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1826">Section 8 of the Bill exempts the Judiciary from deductions under the pension levy.  Perhaps the public will argue that the Judiciary is hiding behind the constitutional protection afforded to it by Article 35 of the Constitution.  This is not a desirable example from a group at the top of the public sector.  The general perception is that as judges pay tax, they should pay the levy.  Why should those who are struggling to make ends meet have to tolerate the members of the Judiciary, who are at the top of the public service pay scale, escaping the payment of this levy?  The levy, which would not noticeably affect the standard of living of the Judiciary, will cripple those on low and middle incomes.  If our judges cannot be compelled to contribute in this way, perhaps they could make a voluntary contribution in the spirit of showing solidarity and setting a good example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1827">The pension levy is a bitter pill to swallow for those whose lives are endless struggles for survival.  It is particularly difficult to accept that this jaded Government, which is out of touch, is led by a Taoiseach whose annual salary exceeds that of the most powerful politician in the world, the US President.  The Government is top heavy with Ministers of State and is burdened with costs such as ministerial cars and Government jets.  There are too many Oireachtas committees and too many Deputies get extra allowances in respect of them.  The position of chairman or convenor of an Oireachtas committee should not be regarded as an honorary one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1828">Section 12 of this Bill relates to the farm waste management scheme, the mishandling of which by the Government is driving many people in the farming sector to bankruptcy.  The farmers of this country have been plunged into a cash-flow crisis.  The Government can afford to plough in excess of €7 billion into the banks, but farmers are being abandoned.  They were forced to borrow heavily to build slatted sheds to meet regulations under the farm waste management scheme.  They are now facing ruin.  Who will bail out the farming sector?  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has failed to deal with this matter in a balanced way that would support our farmers.  The current situation is scandalous.  Farmers were forced to make untenable financial commitments to meet the provisions of the EU directive on the disposal of farm waste.  They made those commitments on the understanding that grant aid would be forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1829">Last October, I argued in this House that the failure of the Minister, Deputy Smith, to extend the deadline for the farm waste management scheme beyond 31 December 2008 was another nail in the coffin of the farming industry.  Farmers were already suffering undue hardship as a result of the Government's inability to manage the scheme effectively, for example, by paying approved grants on time.  This mismanagement is threatening the viability of the farming sector.  It has echoes of the manner in which the nitrates directive was bungled.  I am reminded of the inability of successive agriculture Ministers to handle the delicate balance between the well-being of our farmers and the need to negotiate constructively with the EU.  The refusal of the Minister, Deputy Smith, to extend the deadline for the scheme showed a criminal disregard for the economic viability of the farming industry.  An extension would have eased the frantic demand for payment and diluted the impact of the Minister's breathtaking blunder.  The Department is unable to pay the bill of €400,000 that is owed to our farmers as a result of that error.  The Minister's incompetence is driving farmers off the land and into bankruptcy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1830">Some 18,000 Irish farmers have applied for the waste management grant to enable them to repay the loans they took out on the basis of a promised payback.  What are they supposed to tell their banks?  Should they refer them directly to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  The farmers in question were disproportionately affected by last year's budget.  The future of the farming industry was threatened by the attack on grants for young farmers and on allowances for older farmers who want to take early retirement.  The dioxin crisis shattered global confidence in Irish pigmeat.  Payments under the rural environment protection scheme continue to be delayed.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Smith, and his Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to separate REPS 4 from the waste management scheme.  The many Irish farmers who are involved in organic farming are being denied their REPS 4 payments.  Fair play should prevail in that sector, just like every other sector of the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_1831">I thank Deputies for their contributions.  We have had a useful debate.  I look forward, as the Bill progresses through the House on Committee and Report Stages, to a fuller engagement on the many issues relating to the Bill that have been raised.  This emergency legislation has been drafted and introduced in the House over a short period of time.  That is the nature of emergency legislation.  I intend to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  In particular, I propose to clarify elements of the Bill to avoid any doubt about what is intended by the Government in the application of the deduction.  I propose to introduce a "removal of doubt" section in this legislation, similar in purpose to section 15 of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, on which elements of this Bill are modelled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1832">Many Deputies have queried how these measures will operate.  There is an understandable eagerness to know who will be covered, what elements of income will be included, what rates will apply and what the ultimate effect on the take-home pay of those affected will be.  This debate gives me an opportunity to bring clarity to some of these issues.  I want to respond to a number of specific points this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1833">Deputy Bruton queried the arrangements introduced in 2004 for those whom he feels may, through the integration of their occupational benefit with the social welfare system, qualify for little or no occupational pension despite being subject to the deduction.  Although this issue is likely to come up again on Committee Stage, it might be useful to provide some detail in respect of it on the record now.  I will begin by explaining how the integration system, whereby pensions are calculated for public service employees who are insured for full PRSI and are members of public service pension schemes, works.  Some years ago, the Commission on Public Service Pensions made recommendations on the treatment of part-time employees and employees on lower levels of pay.  With effect from 20 December 2001, the pension system for part-time employees was modified to a <i>pro rata</i> basis, by reference to the remuneration of whole-time employees.  A new system of calculating pensions for employees insured for full PRSI was introduced with effect from 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1834">The new system delivers increased pensions to members of public service pension schemes whose full-time salary is less than three and a half times the contributory State pension.  At present, this amounts to €40,000.  The new integration formula takes into account the value of the contributory State pension in calculating occupational pensions.  The method of calculating a pension for public service employees who qualify for benefits on or after 1 January 2004 is, for that part of the employee's pensionable remuneration which is less than or equal to three and a half times the current rate of the contributory State pension, one two-hundredth of the pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service; and, for any part of the employee's pensionable remuneration which exceeds three and a half times the contributory State pension, one eightieth of the pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service.  The maximum number of years of reckonable service is 40.</p>
          <p eId="para_1835">The new formula is used in all cases of retirement on or after 1 January 2004.  Pensions in course of payment on 1 January 2004 were revised by reference to the new formula in cases where this produced an improvement for the pensioner.  The revised system improved the position for people on lower rates of pay and ensured that everyone who met the requirements of the pension scheme got an occupational pension, regardless of income.  The new pension related deduction will confer no additional pension benefit and will be deducted from gross pay before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated.  As the new integration system ensures that everyone who meets the eligibility criteria of the pension scheme gets an occupational pension, regardless of income, there are no consequences to the interaction of the pension related deduction with the integration system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1836">Deputy Bruton also asked about an actuarial valuation of public servants' pension costs.  The latest full valuation of the value of the public service pension was carried out by the benchmarking body.  The estimated costs of pensions for the representative public service groups chosen by the body are 26% for a civil servant or engineer; 18.7% for a staff nurse; 38% for a garda, who has fast accrual terms in so far as his or her pension is earned in 30 years rather than 40 years; 24.5% for a national school teacher; and 16.5% for a special needs assistant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">The value of the ill health benefits and death in service benefits is not included in the figures I have listed.  Once allowance for these additional benefits is made, the cost of public service benefits for the specimen groups range from around 18% to almost 40%. These costs represent the expected cost to the state of providing these benefits.  However, the value to individual public servants of a public service pension is well above the costs shown.  For example, no allowance is made for the substantial expenses that would be incurred by an individual in the private sector who wishes to attempt to provide for a similar level of pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1838">There is a further benefit associated with a public service pension that is not quantified in the figures.  Pensions for public servants are underpinned by the State.  The security provided by this is a valuable additional benefit to public servants.  Deputy Bruton also referred to those on low pay.  A person on pay of €30,000 per year who is subject to integration will now pay a total contribution of 9.5% of pay.  It is clear from the figures that the value of public service pension benefits is well in excess of the contributions public servants make.  When we could afford it over the past ten years, we progressively reduced the tax burden on the lower paid to a point where 40% of all income earners are now outside the tax net.  According to the latest figures, a married one-income couple with two children on average earnings in Ireland continues to have the lowest tax wedge in the entire OECD.  When tax benefits from the State are taken into account, such families face a negative tax burden for the sixth consecutive year, receiving more money in cash transfers from the State than they pay out in income tax and social security contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1839">In Britain, all income above €6,860 is subject to income tax at 20%.  In this State, workers can earn €18,300 before they start paying tax, PRSI or the income levy.  Our minimum wage is the second highest in the EU.  When it was introduced in 2000, it was subject to income tax and PRSI.  It is now well outside the tax net.  I want to put this on the record, because of the many inaccurate arguments advanced constantly about the unfairness as to who bears the burden of income tax.  All public service workers are paid above the minimum wage, which is an hourly rate.  Anyone earning below €18,000 in the public service is in that position because he or she is a part-time worker.  I recognise that the pension levy is a burden on lower paid workers, but it must be remembered that those on low pay who work for the State do not pay tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1840">It has also been claimed that some public servants will pay more in contributions than the benefits they will receive upon retirement.  That claim takes no account of the considerable service benefits attached to public service pensions.  For example, if a public servant dies in service, his or her family receive a death gratuity of a minimum of one year's pay.  In addition, a pension is paid to the public servant's spouse and dependent children.  These are valuable features of public service employment that must be taken into account in this debate.  Public servants also receive a pension lump sum, which is a tax free payment made in retirement which equals three eightieths of the final salary of the retiring officer for each year of service.  Someone retiring with 40 years' service and a final salary of €50,000 receives a lump sum of €75,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1841">Deputy Bruton stated that someone earning €30,000 would pay a higher percentage of his or her salary than someone earning €45,000.  In terms of gross income, no public servant will pay more in pension levies than a higher paid colleague.  Seeming anomalies may arise when tax relief is taken into account.  In a progressive tax system such as ours, the more one earns, the higher the tax rate one pays, but this also works in the opposite direction.  If the amount of an individual's taxable income is reduced, as will be the case when the new pension levy is applied, the individual will pay less in tax and will suffer less of a net reduction in pay than someone who is not moved from liability to a higher tax rate to a lower liability as a result of the deduction in wages.  Taking all the deductions into account, our tax system remains highly progressive, and those who earn the most, pay the most.  Taking account of taxes and other mandatory stoppages, such as income tax, PRSI, the standard pension contribution, the health and income levies and the new pension related deduction, an unmarried civil servant earning €20,000 per year will pay 11% of his or her gross income on total deductions when the new deduction is introduced.  This compares with 43% of gross income for an equivalent civil servant earning €100,000 per year.  The only way to avoid anomalous positions in the pension levy is to have one income tax rate and no tax credits, or not to give tax relief on the levy.  The point is that the overall system is progressive, and this is as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1842">For someone earning €20,000 a year, the net reduction in take-home pay as a result of the Bill is around €11 per week.  For someone on €50,000, which is close to the average salary in the public service, the reduction is around €38 per week.  These figures are substantial and we recognise that it will not be easy for people, but they have to be seen in the context of the situation facing the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1843">Deputy O'Donnell asked me to confirm whether a freeze on the increments due to public sector employees in 2009 is built into the sum of €1.4 billion.  That figure, which is a full year's saving, is made up as follows.  A total of €1.35 billion comes from the pension related deduction across the public service, with the remaining €50 million relating to other savings, mainly reductions in travelling and subsistence rates.  There is no freeze on increments and consequently no such element is built into the figures.  Stopping the payment of increments, as has been suggested by Deputy O'Donnell's party, would bear disproportionately on lower grades in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1844">Deputy O'Donnell also asked about section 8 which gives the Minister for Finance the power to alter the extent of the deduction if there are materially distinguished classes of public servants.  I do not anticipate the need to use this authority, but it is wise to make such a provision when legislating for such a wide and varied group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1845">I pay tribute to those in other Departments and offices who have worked at short notice to produce this Bill.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Health and Children and the Office of the Attorney General have all assisted staff in my Department in drafting the Bill and in the myriad tasks that accompany emergency legislation such as this.  This is not to mention those in every public service body, who have to work on the practical arrangements arising from the measures in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1846">On the issue of overall fairness, I must once again emphasise the seriousness of the situation facing the public finances and the nation at large.  Many people working in other sectors of the economy have had to face pay cuts, shorter working weeks and redundancy.  Everyone in this House knows how redundancy has stalked this land in recent weeks.  For those still at work, many who had made pension provisions have seen the value of their investments suffer because of the devastating effects of the international downturn in equities, and Irish blue-chip equities in particular.  Against that background, we ask those in a position of secure pensionable employment and with Government-guaranteed pensions, to make their contribution towards addressing both today's difficulties, and the longer-term sustainability challenges facing public service pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1847">I accept that this is not an easy pill to swallow and that for many, the financial contribution will mean a significant drop in their take-home pay.  Some of this effect will  be ameliorated by the falling prices forecast for the remainder of this year.  Falling interest rates have fed through to lower mortgage repayments for householders, and a similar correction in fuel prices has reduced the cost at the petrol pumps and in terms of home heating for many.  While I do not expect that this will necessarily satisfy the public servants affected, the drop in the cost of living we are seeing in the economy must be taken into account in assessing the effect on the overall circumstances of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1848">Ultimately, this is not the time for equivocation.  It is not the time for evasiveness or for woolly thinking and vague half measures. There are no popular initiatives that will deliver the savings needed to meet the day-to-day demands of the Government, and in particular the growing cost of providing for those currently out of work.  The country is facing some of the most difficult times in living memory.  Serious and difficult decisions are called for.  We have gone beyond point-scoring.  We must take action now to deal with the problems we confront.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_509">
            <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_2005">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">Most times I speak I mention Tallaght, but this is about Tallaght Hospital and other hospitals in the region and the country.  I was guided by the edition of the <i>Tallaght Echo</i> published this morning which stated “Hospital Rocked by Further Cuts”.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">I have been committed to Tallaght Hospital since the beginning.  The then Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, appointed me to the planning board of Tallaght Hospital in 1988.  I was involved proudly right the way through and reappointed by different Ministers, including those of different persuasions which I took as a compliment to the community.  When the hospital opened in 1998, I was a member of that board and I have remained associated with the hospital.  I am proud of the hospital and the service it provides.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">The hospital has had many challenges since then, particularly in recent times, and the new economic climate adds to that burden.  I pay tribute to the Tallaght Hospital Action Group.  I and the other three Deputies for the area, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and Deputy Brian Hayes, were present at a meeting in the Plaza Hotel last night at which we discussed concerns of the hospital action group.  I was aware of a statement issued by the Tallaght Hospital board yesterday complimenting the Tallaght Hospital Action Group on its work not only now, but over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">Tallaght Hospital has developed well over the past ten years but there are still problems and challenges.  The Adelaide and Meath Hospital Dublin Incorporating the National Children's Hospital Tallaght provides both tertiary and secondary services to a population of 1.4 million people.  The hospital is a provider of local, regional, supra-regional and national specialties, and over 310,000 patients are treated in the hospital annually.  The board has been acting responsibly and has been working with the HSE and the Department in recent times.  The HSE recently notified the hospital of its 2009 budget allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">This is set against a background where, unfortunately, the hospital is set to lose cancer services.  This is something I regret.  The hospital has a development control plan and I am delighted to note that this provides for the proposed move of the Coombe Women &amp; Infants University Hospital to Tallaght, the new paediatric ambulatory and urgent care centre which will be located in Tallaght, the co-located private hospital, the next phase of the faculty of health sciences and what the hospital board describes as other clinical developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">There have also been many positive developments in recent times, including the centre for cardiovascular risk in younger persons, CRYP, officially opened in 2008, a bowel screening service, which is proving very successful, and the expansion of the laboratories.</p>
            <p eId="para_2012">The HSE announcement yesterday is what I want to highlight tonight.  People in Tallaght are very concerned.  They point out that while all hospitals are subject to cuts in their budget from the HSE, the cut in Tallaght is particularly stark and has caused a great deal of shock.  I want guarantees from the Minister, either tonight or otherwise, that patient care and those services will not be affected by any proposed cuts and I ask the Minister to ensure that the HSE plan takes account of this.  It is important that such an assurance is given.</p>
            <p eId="para_2013">At the end of the day, the hospital, like every hospital in every region of the country, is about patient care.  I have been a patient in Tallaght Hospital.  I know what it is like to be challenged by health problems that require hospital services.  I have always taken the view, with which I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Johnny Brady, would agree, that a sick person who goes to any of our hospitals should be looked after properly.  Media coverage of the proposed cuts to the HSE budgets mean that people are crying out for guarantees that, whatever else is cut, and I know this is a challenge, patient care is maintained.  I hope the Minister of State conveys that message to the Department and to the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_510">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_2014">The key priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive in dealing with serious budgetary pressures on the health services is to minimise the effect on services for patients to the greatest degree possible.  The HSE is facing financial pressures arising in a large degree from the broader economic situation, an increase in the number of medical cards and lower receipts from the health levy.  These cost pressures are factors outside the HSE's management control.  However, while dealing with this, the executive is also clear that it must do all in its power to control costs within the planned profile of spending over the year.  The HSE board met yesterday to consider these pressures and the executive will now work intensively with the Minister and her Department to manage this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">We will have to deliver more for a given level of resources and this will require the co-operation of all in the health sector.  A key objective for the Health Service Executive in 2009 is to reduce overall costs to manage the delivery of activity targets as outlined and agreed in its national service plan for 2009.  In this regard, hospital budgets across the network have been allocated in accordance with the overall budget available to the National Hospitals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">The profile of planned activity levels in the national service plan is designed to facilitate the cost reductions through the introduction of a number of expenditure control measures.  In particular, there will be an emphasis throughout 2009 on the conversion of inpatient to day case activity, reducing the average length of stay for patients and improving the operational efficiency of outpatient departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">With regard to Tallaght Hospital, the hospital is in discussion with the HSE in relation to its 2009 service plan.  The shared objective is to ensure the highest quantum of service is provided within available financing and to ensure the service plan is delivered without impacting on front-line services.  This approach is being replicated across each hospital network.</p>

          <heading>Human Trafficking.</heading>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_2018">The case I want to raise can best be outlined by the summary provided by Ruhama.  Anyone who knows about victims of the sex industry is aware of the work of Ruhama.  The organisation has outlined in summary the case of Edith Orumwenes and its concerns about whether basic minimum standards of protection and assistance to presumed victims of human trafficking are being adhered to in Ireland:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2019">In early November, Edith Orumwenes was arrested in Castlebar for not having identification papers.  We first met Edith in early December in the Dóchas Centre in Dublin, we assessed her under the UN Protocol on Human Trafficking and we identified her as a presumed victim of human trafficking.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2020">The indicators of human trafficking found in this woman's case were clear: the country of origin and particular state (Edo, where 80% victims of sex trafficking victims in Nigeria come according to UN statistics).  Her account of how she was recruited was credible — her position of vulnerability, poverty, lack of education, she had never travelled abroad before and she was fleeing a forced marriage.  The signs of trauma — high level of anxiety, emotionally upset, difficulty sleeping and no documentation — were all present.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2021">Ruhama is very much aware of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the sex trade in Ireland and how traffickers are supplying the sex industry with women.  Edith’s version of what happened her was consistent; she told us about how her original trafficker handed her over to pimps, how she was photographed for the Internet, given a mobile phone, and told what prices to charge.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2022">Following our identification of her as a presumed victim of trafficking, we referred her to the superintendent in GNIB for consideration under the recovery and reflection period.  We also asked that the liaison officer from GNIB would come and meet with Edith in the Dóchas Centre as we believed they had more knowledge and experience of assessing victims of trafficking than the local gardaí in Mayo.  However after two requests the GNIB liaison officer was not sent to meet with Edith and the assessment of Edith as a presumed victim of sex trafficking was left to the gardaí in Castlebar.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">From my understanding, they had no idea what to look for in a trafficking case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">From our first-hand experience of attending the court hearings, we could see that when this woman presented as irritable or unable to meet the demands of the criminal justice system she was labelled "uncooperative" and was penalised for this.  In our opinion she was clearly viewed as a criminal and not as a potential victim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">Edith was expected to cooperate with gardaí in Castlebar after she had spent long hours travelling from Dublin and attending the court hearing; she was often physically and emotionally exhausted.  On one occasion she spent up to 20 hours from the time she left the Dóchas Centre until her return, placing further strain on her already fragile emotional state.  This does not suggest a concern for her welfare.  We are concerned to have since been told that on all occasions Edith received very little food or drink.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">It is well established that when people are in trauma they suffer from memory loss and disorientation.  I quote from the IOM manual on dealing with victims of human trafficking which is used by the Garda training: "Even if an individual lies about or refuses to disclose certain information on occasions, or forgets or changes parts of her/his story, this is not a reason to discredit other information they have provided or to determine the individual is untrustworthy."  This accepted norm was clearly not applied in this case.  At Ruhama we found Edith to be cooperative, polite and forthcoming with information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">Best practice recommends the importance of helping the presumed victim to feel safe and that she is approached in a manner that builds trust.  This is where the reflection and recovery stage is important in the process.  This did not happen in Edith's case; she was incarcerated despite disclosing early in the investigation that she was forced into prostitution.  This did not inspire confidence or trust on her side, or create an environment conducive to cooperation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">However she was cooperative with the gardaí.  She provided an account of her movements in Ireland, she surrendered her mobile phone, which was not used in the court case against her, she provided information on her movements in Ireland during numerous interviews, she pointed out the house in which she alleges she was held captive and she watched CCTV and made positive identification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">We believe the screening of a presumed victim of human trafficking was not adequately carried out by the gardaí in Mayo because of their lack of experience and knowledge on the issue.  Ruhama workers tried talking to local gardaí about the best practice guidelines for working with victims of sex trafficking but they told her that they had been advised by GNIB that they could keep her in prison for months while trying to establish her true identity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">This is no way to treat a victim who has more than likely been trafficked by a gang for profit from a poor region of Nigeria into Ireland to feed the sex industry, where she was probably abused.  She has been treated as an illegal immigrant, without identification and put in prison for months.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_2032">On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I assure him that I share his concern and that of all right thinking people that the heinous crime of human trafficking should be tackled effectively and that suspected victims of human trafficking should be helped and treated appropriately.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 has been fully operational since 7 June 2008.  This legislation criminalises the trafficking in children and adults for the purposes of their sexual or labour exploitation, or the removal of their organs.  It also makes it an offence to sell or offer for sale, or to purchase or offer to purchase, any person for any purpose.  Penalties of up to life imprisonment apply in respect of these offences.  It is not a defence for the trafficker to argue that the person consented to the commission of any of the acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">It is also an offence under this Act for a person to solicit a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution where the person soliciting knows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that the person has been trafficked.  The soliciting can take place anywhere, in public or in private.  Any person who accepts or agrees to accept any kind of payment in exchange for the prostitution of the trafficked person will also commit an offence.  Fines of up to €5,000 and 12 months' imprisonment apply on summary conviction, and an unlimited fine and up to five years' imprisonment if a person is convicted on indictment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">In addition to this comprehensive criminal legislation and also with effect from 7 June 2008, recovery and reflection periods of 45 days — which were recently increased to 60 days — were introduced for potential victims of trafficking.  Where the victim is willing to assist the Garda Síochána with an investigation or prosecution concerning the alleged trafficking, periods of temporary residency permission of up to six months renewable were introduced.  The recovery and reflection and temporary residence provisions were introduced on an administrative basis, pending the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill later this year, when such provisions will be put on a statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2036">As well as these legislative measures, the Government has introduced a number of administrative measures to ensure an effective and comprehensive response to human trafficking.  An interdepartmental high level group with representatives from key Departments has been established to recommend the most appropriate and effective policy responses to human trafficking to the Minister.  An anti-human trafficking unit has been established in the Department to ensure that the State response to trafficking in human beings is co-ordinated, comprehensive and holistic.  A key element of this strategy is the development of a national action plan to prevent and tackle trafficking in human beings to be approved by the high level group and submitted to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_2037">From the beginning, the Government has adopted a multidisciplinary partnership approach to tackling human trafficking in Ireland.  Representatives from the interdepartmental high level group and the anti-human trafficking unit engage with NGOs and international organisations in a round table forum held about every four months.  In addition, five interdisciplinary working groups — made up of representatives from the relevant Government agencies, NGOs and international organisations  — are working to progress matters on a range of issues.  These include the development of a national referral mechanism, awareness raising and training, child trafficking, labour exploitation issues and sexual exploitation issues, and in turn to report to the high level group.  In total, 34 different State, international and non-governmental organisations are involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">The Garda Síochána has placed particular importance on ensuring that its members receive training which will equip them to tackle the phenomenon of human trafficking.  Some 250 members of the Garda Síochána, including members from each Garda division, have completed a continuous professional development training course entitled "Tackling Trafficking in Human Beings: Prevention, Protection and Prosecution".  In addition, 520 probationer gardaí have received awareness training as part of their final phase of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">It is not appropriate for the Minister to comment on the outcome of a court case in which the person referred to by the Deputy was involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2041">Equally it is not appropriate to comment in detail on the facts of any individual case, involving as it would disclosing sensitive personal information.  I can say that the Minister has been informed by the Garda Síochána that in this case, as in every case of potential human trafficking made known to them, all the information was carefully assessed in determining if there were reasonable grounds for believing the woman in question was a victim of human trafficking under sections 2 or 4 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act.  As with any case, the Garda Síochána will examine any new information that comes to light.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">To date, two persons have been granted the 60-day recovery and reflection period and one of these has been granted a six-month temporary residence.  The Garda Síochána is also actively investigating a number of other cases.  It is the Minister's policy and that of the Garda Síochána that no person who is potentially a victim of human trafficking will be removed from the State before that investigation is complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_2047">Asgard II sank off the French coast in the Bay of Biscay on 11 September 2008.  In general, in the case of sinkings, it is imperative that salvage operations begin immediately, subject only to weather conditions, to ensure that as little damage as possible occurs due to sea conditions and, more particularly, the corrosive effects of salt water.  However, in this instance this did not happen.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not in the House this evening, but I think that from the very beginning a decision was made that the Asgard would not be salvaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">Allianz insurers invited three salvage companies to submit quotations for raising the vessel from the sea floor and set a deadline of 17 October for the receipt of offers.  I understand that at the request of one of the salvage companies, this deadline was extended by two weeks to 31 October, during which period a suitable weather window for the salvage operation presented itself.  In salvage operations suitable weather windows are essential but, unfortunately, they do not present themselves to order.  The time estimated for the salvage operation is approximately four weeks, which includes mobilisation and demobilisation for placing, de-rigging and removal of lifting equipment on and off the site.  This opportunity was not taken, however, and it is my opinion that a decision was made very early on that the whole operation would not start immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">Many people are very disappointed with the Minister's decision as well as with his prevarication and procrastination.  He accused me in the House of trying to exaggerate the position and being disingenuous when I said the matter was urgent.  It is obvious that I was right, however.  The master of the <i>Asgard,</i> Captain Colm Newport, told <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday that he was very disappointed with the Minister’s decision.  He said he was still in discussions with a Dutch company about its salvage.  He has questioned the competence of the advice given to the Minister, Deputy O’Dea, on the difficulties of raising the hull.  If the master of the ship, Captain Newport, who is a highly respected individual, said that, it raises major doubts about the advice the Minister received as well as the Minister’s judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">Captain Newport says the vessel can be raised and treated pending its full restoration.  He believes the State has an obligation to remove the ship from French waters.  We had the same response from the <i>Asgard’s</i> crew who sent a letter to all of us saying they were so distressed by this decision.  The Minister is not here but perhaps my remarks can be conveyed to him.  He should at least present us with the report on why the ship was not raised.  Deputy Coveney will no doubt mention a proposal he presented to the Minister, but the Minister did not even consult us about it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_520">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_2051">This matter has been handled appallingly.  This vessel, which is owned by the Irish State, sank almost six months ago.  Thank God no one lost their life because the crew managed to get off the vessel before it sank.  The vessel has a significant history.  It is not a yachting issue for people who like to go sailing or send their children sailing.  The <i>Asgard’s</i> role is far more fundamental.  Some 10,000 people from all sorts of backgrounds have been on the vessel during sail training programmes of various types that were highly valuable.  I have personal experience of the positive effects that sail training can have on people who need direction and guidance.  The <i>Asgard</i> fulfilled that role, but it is now at the bottom of the sea.  I spoke to the Minister last week and gave him a proposal that was put together by a series of people who wanted to compile an accurate costing for the vessel’s refurbishment if it was refloated.  Some €3.8 million is available to the Minister in insurance attached to the <i>Asgard II</i>.  It will cost approximately €1.5 million to €2 million to raise the vessel, which leaves in or around €2 million to refurbish it.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2052">Deputy Deenihan and I told the Minister that if he is going to leave the ship at the bottom of the sea, he should at least give us a written consideration as to why he is doing so, backed up with evidence and costings.  We do not want the opinions of the board of Coiste an Asgard which made a recommendation to the Minister, having discussed the issue at length.  I want to see hard evidence before I will support any proposal to leave this vessel at the bottom of the sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">Neither will I accept that the vessel cannot be raised and refurbished at a cost that is potentially much less than the Minister's proposal to build a new vessel, a steel replica of <i>Asgard</i>
                            <i>II</i>.  Such a proposal will cost between €5 million and €7 million which is not an option in the current economic environment.  The Government knows that.  This is a spin job to get people to accept that the boat will remain at the bottom of the sea.  The Government does not want to raise the vessel and does not want the risks associated with that.  It promises to build a replica at some stage in the future but I do not believe it will.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">The least the Opposition can expect is that the Minister will provide a written report outlining the basis of the recommendation to leave this vessel, which has already been valued at €4 million, unsalvaged.  There is also an investigative responsibility on the Minister to discover why the ship sank which will not be established unless it is raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_2055">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea.  I thank Deputies Deenihan and Coveney for raising the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">Yesterday, the Minister announced he had accepted the recommendation from the board of Coiste An Asgard on the possibility of salvaging the sail-training vessel <i>Asgard II</i>.  The board’s unanimous recommendation was that a salvage operation should not be pursued any further and the Minister concurred with this view having carefully considered its report to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">Spending approximately €2 million on a salvage effort, the outcome of which would be uncertain, cannot be afforded at this time.  A real risk exists whereby more than €2 million could be expended on a salvage effort that proves unsuccessful or, following which, the vessel is found to be damaged beyond repair.  Until the vessel is salvaged, it would not be possible to assess whether it can be restored and the cost of doing so.  Clearly, the greater the damage, the higher the cost of restoration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">Asgard II is a 30-year old wooden vessel that would have faced ever-increasing maintenance costs.  The board was of the opinion that even after full restoration, the vessel might have ongoing maintenance problems.  In addition, the possibility of increased regulatory requirements by the Department of Transport could add substantially to the cost of restoration.  The board also took into account that parents of potential trainees may be reluctant to allow their children to sail on a vessel that had sunk.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">While the name Asgard has been associated with two important vessels, it is also about sail-training and introducing young people to the experience of sailing.  The Minister's priority is to ensure the continuation of the sail-training scheme.  The Minister accepted the board's recommendation to initiate planning for the procurement of a new steel hulled vessel, similar in design to <i>Asgard II</i> .  A steel hulled vessel would be less expensive to build and maintain than a wooden hulled vessel.  It is also hoped that the future <i>Asgard III</i> would have facilities to cater for persons with physical disabilities, which the <i>Asgard II</i> could not.</p>
            <p eId="para_2060">The Minister knows it was a difficult conclusion for the board to reach, but it is one he accepts as being right and sensible.  The costs and risks involved in attempting to salvage and restore <i>Asgard II</i> are too great.  There is no doubt it was an outstanding sail-training vessel, held in the highest regard both at home and abroad.  She was an excellent ambassador for the country for 30 years.  However, the Minister believes the measures outlined for a new vessel will ensure sail-training in this country continues.</p>

          <heading>Export Credit Insurance.</heading>
          <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_522">
            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_2061">Last night I met the representative of a large exporting company in Munster who was extremely concerned at what he described as the drying up of export credit insurance.  Export credit insurance works in the following way.  If a company is exporting products abroad, while it may not be paid straight away, its payment is insured.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">Export credit insurance, however, is drying up making it difficult for companies to export their products.  The Irish Exporters Association is concerned that credit insurance underwriters have cancelled or substantially reduced the credit cover extended to exporters in Ireland.  It has pointed out that this has put the €9 billion of exports covered by credit insurance on a rolling six-month basis, and a further €10 billion of home-based trading covered by credit insurance.  It has described it as a crisis, affecting the supply of locally produced goods and services to exporting companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">France, the UK, Belgium and Portugal have put in place state-backed export credit insurance schemes in recent weeks.  The Irish Exporters Association and the IFA have come together to press the Government to bring forward a similar scheme.  It is important this is done soon as exporting companies are under intense pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">I am pleased the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy McGuinness, is present in the Chamber.  I look forward to his reply and hope he will inform the House the Government will move quickly on this matter.  The survival of exporting companies is at stake.  We know of the perilous state of the economy and how important it is to support companies to trade out of this situation.  If the export credit insurance issue can be resolved, it will assist these companies.  The representative of the large company I met last night told me that if this is not sorted soon, his company will be in serious trouble.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_2065">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, with which I am familiar and which is of great concern to the exporters and companies he mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">Since the State withdrew from the provision of export credit insurance in 1998, exporters have been able to avail of such insurance on the open market as commercial operators made such cover easily available and there was significant take-up of policies by exporters.  However, there appears to be evidence that in recent months insurers have been reducing or withdrawing cover and that, therefore, there has been some market failure in this sector.  In recent weeks, this lack of affordable credit insurance, including export credit insurance, has been strongly highlighted by exporters as presenting a significant problem.  As a result, business groups have requested that the State assist in the provision of such insurance cover.  Some weeks ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment met business representatives and listened to their concerns on this issue.  Like the Deputy, I also met groups and individual representatives in respect of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">This problem is not unique to Ireland.  The underlying reasons are linked to the global financial crisis and the lack of credit generally available.  Other EU member states are facing similar problems and we have been engaging with them and the European Commission with a view to helping our understanding of the issues so that we can develop a fast and informed response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">While the concept of State support should be considered, it is important, in the current difficult financial environment, that in the first instance we establish the facts of the matter by engaging with the key stakeholders, including the insurance providers, before committing the State to taking any initiatives in this regard.  In bringing forward proposals in this area, it is important that the State should not be left exposed to unacceptably high risks.  The Deputy will appreciate that a key requirement of any such initiative would be that it should be designed to be self-financing and time limited.  In addition, a financial cap to limit the exposure of the State in the event of significant losses developing would have to be imposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">To properly assess what is an extremely complex issue, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has asked Forfás and Enterprise Ireland, working closely with officials in the Department, to expedite a detailed analysis of the position.  This work is well advanced and a report will be ready for her consideration by the end of the month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">I am sure the Deputy appreciates that a thorough analysis of the facts must be undertaken in the assessment to which I refer.  Early indications are that in light of the current economic uncertainty, with rapidly increasing default rates, the issue is unlikely to be as simple and cost-neutral as portrayed by some business interests.  Analysis to date of one particular proposal has pointed to the State being exposed to very high costs, both in terms of default payments and administration.  In addition to potentially significant operating costs, a new administrative structure would need to be devised, legislation may be necessary and EU state aid rules may be an issue.  The actual cost-benefit of this type of scheme must also be fully assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">The impression has been given that most other EU and OECD states are operating short-term export credit insurance schemes and that Ireland is, therefore, very much alone in not doing so.  However, the vast majority of schemes operated by these other countries are in respect of longer-term strategic capital and infrastructural projects, and usually only cover very limited sectors.  It is not correct to state that the type of short-term insurance scheme being sought by Irish exporters is generally available in our competitor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">A number of other OECD countries are approaching the issue from an alternative perspective through the banking system.  Such initiatives have focused on the provision of some form of credit or working capital guarantees for exporting companies.  Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Finance, are examining a number of these initiatives.  Should this examination prove that a new insurance scheme is not realistic or feasible for a variety of strategic reasons, including costs, both to companies and the State, and effectiveness, it may be appropriate to look at securing alternative assistance to credit-worthy trading companies through the banking system, which already provides a number of trade finance alternatives to credit insurance.  This could be considered in the context of the assistance being provided by the Government to the banking sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">I assure the Deputy that we are working quickly and thoroughly to establish the facts and set out the options.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends to bring this matter to the Cabinet as a priority next month when she has received and considered the report currently under preparation.  A final decision will then be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2075">The State makes a significant investment in training measures for both employed and unemployed. In order to oversee the efficient delivery of training provision for the employed, an Upskilling Coordination Group chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was established. This Group is comprised of representatives from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and their respective key training providers including FÁS, Skillnets, Engineers Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards, the Vocational Educational Colleges, the Institutes of Technology and the Higher Education Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">The purpose of this group is to discuss any issues concerning the provision of training that arise amongst the State's key training providers. It aims to improve interagency cooperation, facilitate the exchange of information on operational and policy aspects and the avoidance of duplication. It also aims to ensure that the impact realised from the State's investment in education and training is maximized.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">The Tánaiste recently announced the availability of 51,000 new training places under the FÁS Training Initiatives Strategy.  These places are in addition to the 27,000 previously planned for 2009 under the Bridging Foundation Training, Specific Skills Training and Traineeships Programmes. These programmes will provide short training courses for those who are recently unemployed. The Training Initiative Strategy enhances the traditional mix of course offerings and will be delivered through three core-training initiatives, Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses.  The courses are for highly employable persons who wish to add to their existing skills level and improve their prospects of re-entering the labour market.  The night courses offer further flexibility and the online courses provide an excellent option for those who need a fast flexible intervention and who prefer a self directed E learning and blended learning environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">In the current economic climate it is important to ensure that people can avail of such relatively immediate up-skilling to best position themselves for employment. FÁS already contracts with some VECs or Institutes of Technology for provision of training courses. All of these organisations are working together at both national and local level to ensure that both the education and training sectors respond in an optimal way to the situation we are currently facing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2080">I welcome the report on FÁS by the Public Accounts Committee, which was published last week and I commend the Committee for the work carried out in this matter. I will be paying particular attention to the recommendations made and to the underlying rationale for making them.  I note that while the report in general concentrates on the things that went wrong, the Committee is of the view that the good work being done by the employees of FÁS should not be overlooked and this examination is no reflection on their role and the valuable contribution they make to Irish life. I fully concur with this view.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Many of the issues contained in the report have already been aired in public. I have previously expressed my concerns in respect of various matters raised by internal audit reports in FÁS and subsequently taken up by the C&amp;AG in an earlier report on a number of public bodies.  Since the publication of those reports a series of steps have been undertaken to deal with the matters raised. In particular:</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">FÁS has clarified its procedures and strengthened its internal controls;</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">An internal cross-functional communications and marketing strategy group has been established in FÁS;</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">FÁS has passed certain issues to the Gardaí for investigation;</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">A new Director General has been appointed on a temporary basis;</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">The C&amp;AG has commenced a wide-ranging investigation in FÁS, which  includes internal controls, governance arrangements, marketing and advertising and specific follow-up of matters raised in the course of hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts;</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">A review of the Science Challenge Initiative with a view to making recommendations on the Initiative's future is currently underway, and it will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">In my view, FÁS should continue to remain focused on its core mission, given the employment and training challenges currently facing the country.  The Board of FÁS has already stated that whatever additional actions are necessary arising from the Report will be fully implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_2090">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>

The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.

FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.

            <p eId="para_2108">The detailed information being sought by the Deputy, going back to 2000, is currently being researched across my Department; however, given the short time available to me since the Deputy tabled this Question, I am not yet in a position to provide those details.  I will however, communicate further with the Deputy once the research is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">The House will appreciate that my Department administers Exchequer funds, European funds, most notably the European Social Fund (ESF), and the National Training Fund (NTF) and in so doing we implement an array of central Government, European Commission and, of course, our own internal financial controls — all aimed at ensuring that national and European moneys are properly applied.  Where an audit or other financial "check" by, or on behalf of, my Department appears to suggest that moneys may have been misapplied or, as may sometimes occur, technical breaches of financial accounting requirements may have occurred, my Department, in the first instance, works with the Body concerned to endeavour to resolve the matter such that the financial procedures being implemented by the Body concerned are brought back into compliance with minimal recoupment of funds resulting.  In some cases, for example under the European Structural Funds Financial Regulations, a breach of those regulations can often be corrected in such a way that the structural funds are not lost to Ireland, although they may have to be recovered from the particular Body concerned and applied elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">In that regard, I should stress that my Department works collaboratively with the Bodies we fund in an effort to minimize the prospect of a breach of financial control systems.  Nonetheless, it can come to pass that in some cases we inevitably have to seek to recover moneys where they were misapplied or simply not adequately or properly accounted for, although this is always the last option we seek to exercise, save in cases of fraud or embezzlement etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">Finally, in relation to the specific case the Deputy raises in the early part of his Question, I am informed that the Body concerned failed an audit control check by my Department in that the "audit trail" requirements under EU Structural Funds rules were not met.  In such circumstances, my Department has sought to recover the moneys involved and that process is in train.  Accordingly, I would prefer not to go further into the details of the issues involved at this time as the matter is currently before the Courts, although I would be happy to share with the Deputy and the House the details of the case once the matter has been brought to a conclusion.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2113">Our immediate policy objectives with regard to competitiveness are to restore confidence and stability in our economy, provide supports to the enterprise sector, restore cost competitiveness, safeguard the significant achievements of recent years and ensure a return to sustainable export growth. Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to address these objectives.  At this time I think it is also important to point out that Ireland made significant progress over the past decade in transforming our economy and building fundamental strengths, and so we enter this period of uncertainty from a strong base.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">Competitiveness has a number of dimensions and is a very broad policy area.  Ireland continues to be a leading country in terms of the attraction of overseas investment. The IBM Global Location Trends Annual Report 2008 in October 2008, ranks Ireland as one of the top performers at 3rd place for attracting R&amp;D investment. The Lisbon Council's "European Jobs and Growth" Monitor as recently as November 2008, ranks Ireland 2nd  most competitive economy in Europe in 2008.  Educational attainment in Ireland has increased significantly in recent years and Ireland is also making substantial progress in strengthening its research and development capabilities.  We also have a substantial and sustained focus on our targeted capital investment programme.  To help business cope with the current difficulties we have taken determined action to address the fundamental issue of access to finance for business, by way of the new code of practice for banks linked to the re-capitalisation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">Cost competitiveness is also a particular focus of action.  Already there are indicators in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  With regard to energy costs, I made my views clear in the House a number of weeks ago and I am glad that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has now indicated that he expects that there will be a double-digit reduction in electricity prices before the end of the year.  A reduction in energy costs will be highly significant in protecting employment and maintaining business activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">We are committed to maintain low business taxes and will ensure that our policies keep pace with the way business is changing.  The Government recently introduced a Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, called "Building Ireland's Smart Economy" which sets out a clear roadmap for Ireland's move back to economic growth and prosperity.  The Cabinet Committee for Economic Renewal will drive this strategy and we will continue to pursue policies that will build on our strengths, address our weaknesses and ensure that we are well placed to take advantage of the global upturn when it comes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2122">I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 62 and 94 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">The issue of north south price differentials has been the subject of concern for some time. The House will be aware of the widespread concerns, particularly amongst consumers, that the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value against Sterling are not being passed on by way of lower prices in the shops. These concerns were heightened by a number of cross border surveys undertaken by the National Consumer Agency which showed significant differentials in the price of a range of goods in this jurisdiction as compared with prices for those goods in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">In the light of these concerns, I initiated an engagement with the retail sector to ascertain the reasons why the benefits of the Euro's appreciation were not being passed on to consumers. In the course of this ongoing engagement, I have met with the various links in the retail chain including retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers. Different and indeed conflicting reasons have been proffered as to why prices in this jurisdiction are higher than in the Northern Ireland and the UK. Prominent among these reasons was that the cost of doing business in Ireland was significantly higher than the cost of operating in the UK. Accordingly, I requested Forfás to carry out an analysis of the relative cost of doing business in a number of locations in the Republic, Northern Ireland and the UK.  Forfás' analysis, which was published late last year, found that whilst the cost of doing business was indeed higher in this jurisdiction, the extent of this additional cost would only justify a differential of 5-6% in prices between the south and the north. It is clear therefore, that operating costs, whilst somewhat higher in this jurisdiction, do not account for the current level of price differentials.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">Aside from operating cost considerations, there is considerable disagreement among the different elements of the retail chain as to reasons for the north south price differentials. In my meetings with retailers, they have strongly contended that the costs to retailers of sourcing goods in Ireland is significantly greater than the costs of sourcing such goods in Northern Ireland and the UK and that the current structure of the wholesale and distribution cost base in Ireland is preventing the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value from being passed on to consumers.  Suppliers and distributors for their part have contended that there is a significant imbalance in the relationship between retailers and suppliers which is giving rise to suppliers being squeezed by the increasingly difficult demands being made by retailers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">The Government for its part is strongly of the view that it is not acceptable that the benefits of the Euro's appreciation of approximately 30% in value over sterling is not being passed on by way of lower prices to consumers in all cases. It is incumbent upon all links in the retail chain to play their part in ensuring that there is the greatest degree of transparency possible as to reasons for the current north south price differentials, particularly given their possible impact on the national economy in terms of loss of employment, loss of trade, loss of revenue to the exchequer and loss of value to the consumer. It is my intention, therefore, to continue to pursue this issue with the retail sector to ensure that Irish consumers receive a fair deal and value for money when doing their day to day shopping.</p>

            <p eId="para_2140">I have been directly involved in the on-going situation in Waterford Crystal for some time now.  Both myself and my Senior Officials have engaged in a series of meetings relating to the future of this company.  The company is currently in receivership.  I have met with the Receiver, on a number of occasions since his appointment last month.  The Receiver, himself,  has had discussions with parties who have expressed an interest in becoming involved in the future of the company.  The Receiver's objectives include, inter alia, negotiation of a sale that would secure the maximum number of jobs in Waterford and the continuation of Waterford Crystal as a going concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">I have also met with certain parties who might be interested in becoming involved with Waterford Crystal.  These discussions are commercially sensitive and must remain confidential.  I should also say that the company is a client of Enterprise Ireland and that agency is also providing every assistance it can at present.  I am very much aware of the concerns of all the people in Waterford City and County and, indeed, the South East Region as a whole.  As recently, as last Wednesday, I met with a delegation from Waterford Chamber of Commerce to discuss the ongoing situation. I am most anxious to see a satisfactory outcome to the work of the Receiver in the interests of both the workers and the economy in the City and its environs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">Since 2004, Irish labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the European Union. For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand. These key economic sectors include healthcare, information technology and financial services. The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced under the Employment Permits Act, 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">Currently employment permit holders constitute approximately 1.5% of the total labour force. Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the numbers of permit applications and consequent numbers of permits issued over the last six months have been showing a consistent downward trend.  Our employment permit arrangements are currently being reviewed to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2146">The Research and Development Fund is a programme funded through the Vote of my Department and delivered by Enterprise Ireland to the indigenous Irish business sector.  It was introduced in a revised simplified form at the beginning of 2008 to provide support for in-company research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development, and it enables companies to progress from an initial research project all the way  to high level innovation and R&amp;D activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">In 2008,  Enterprise Ireland approved funding from the Research and Development Fund for 99 companies — 92 of which were small or medium sized enterprises. The total expenditure of R&amp;D funding was €63.3m, of which €59.5 million was provided to Small and Medium Enterprises.  This means that 94% of the Research and Development Fund went to small and medium sized enterprises in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">In addition to the Research and Development Fund, there are a number of other innovation supports in place, for which small and medium sized enterprises are eligible.  During 2008 the following supports were provided to Small and Medium Enterprise—</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">Under the Innovation Vouchers Scheme, 588 small companies were awarded a total of €2.9 million to enable them to undertake work on a specific innovation issue</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">The Innovation Partnership programme provided funds totalling €5.7 million to 34 SMEs to undertake projects that had a total value of €8.34 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">Enterprise Ireland Feasibility Support amounting to €252,400 was provided to 12 SMEs to engage in the EU Framework Seven Research Programme.  Support under this programme has facilitated  SMEs to benefit from  €20.3 million in EU funding from Framework Programme Seven between January 2007 and October 2008</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">Enterprise Ireland provides funding under a Patent Support Programme under which 18 SMEs were approved for €443,500 funding in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">The range and level of supports to SMEs have made a significant impact in terms of encouraging companies to undertake research, development and innovation.  This, coupled with the fiscal supports available, in particular the increase in the R&amp;D Tax Credit to 25% in the Budget, have been important supports to Irish small and medium sized enterprise sector and has helped them to maximise the potential for growth and competitiveness.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_2158">I refer the Deputy to my replies to Priority Question No 67 and Oral Question No 76 on 10 December 2008, where I set out in detail to the House, the various initiatives and measures in place to address the credit crunch and its impact on SMEs, through Enterprise Ireland, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards, FAS and my own Department, as a follow-up to the Small Business Forum's Report. These measures and initiatives are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">Since December, a number of actions have been taken by Government in relation to securing a stable and active banking system to serve the needs of the economy. The Bank Guarantee Scheme, the Nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the Recapitalisation Scheme all address this issue in order to support the broader economy.  In particular, the Government's Recapitalisation Scheme for Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland announced on Wednesday 11 February 2009 is a fundamental requirement in restoring stability to our financial sector. Such stability will ensure that the financial institutions can actively contribute to our economic activity and particularly support our enterprise sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">A key principle of the Recapitalisation Package is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly in relation to SMEs.  SMEs are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of the overall package. The package contains a range of initiatives that will directly assist our enterprise sector, as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% in 2009.  The banks have committed to public campaigns to actively promote their lending to SMEs.  There is also scope for increased levels of lending to SMEs if mortgage lending is not taken up.  This commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February. This Code will facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions and will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by banks. The Code should strengthen the bank-client relationship and develop greater trust and confidence in the banks' lending practices.  Banks are now actively promoting new lending as evidenced by recent press and TV advertisements</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The Government has decided that there should be an independent review of bank lending to report within five weeks. The recapitalised banks have agreed to fund this independent review which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives. The banks have also undertaken to co-operate fully with this review</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">Building on the banks commitment to the indigenous Venture Capital sector, AIB and Bank of Ireland will both commit a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland's Seed and Venture Capital Programme, to further create and develop indigenous enterprise</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">The recapitalised banks have confirmed that they have established, or are about to introduce, a €100m Fund each to support environment friendly investment and innovations in clean energy. A quarterly report will be made to the Financial Regulator on the loans made and the purposes for which they have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">Prompt payment is important to underpin cash flow, particularly for small businesses. The recapitalised banks have committed to prompt payment arrangements in future customer contracts which will involve payment within 30 days, and a late payment interest charge on any payments, made after 30 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">The availability of a pool of skilled support for major companies and construction projects is an essential component of Ireland's attraction as a business location. The recapitalised banks have agreed to work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and with State agencies to ensure the supply of appropriate finance to contractors engaged on major projects sponsored by them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">The banks have agreed to engage in a ‘Clearing Group' chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies. The purpose of this Group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">As part of the overall monitoring of the Recapitalisation Package, my Department will remain in regular contact with the Department of Finance and will also ensure that the availability of credit to SMEs is kept under constant review.  I will also continue to consult with the representative bodies of small and medium-sized enterprises on all issues impacting on small businesses and I welcome their ongoing valuable inputs to this process.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2171">Since the State withdrew from the provision of Export Credit Insurance in 1998, exporters have been able to avail of such insurance on the open market, as commercial operators made such cover easily available and there was significant take-up of policies by exporters. However, it would appear that over recent months there is evidence that insurers have been reducing or withdrawing cover and it would appear that there has therefore been some market failure in this sector.  Over the past number of weeks, this lack of affordable credit insurance, including export credit insurance, has been strongly highlighted by exporters as a significant problem and business groups have requested that the State assist in the provision of such insurance cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">I am naturally concerned that exporters are finding it more difficult to secure insurance and while the concept of State support may be warranted, it is very important in the current difficult financial environment, that we first of all establish the facts of the matter by engaging with all key stakeholders, including the insurance providers, before committing the State to taking any initiatives in this regard.  In bringing forward any proposals in this area, it is important that the State is not left exposed to unacceptably high risk.  A key requirement would be that any State initiative would be designed to be self-financing and time limited, and also that there would be a financial cap, to limit the exposure of the State, in the event of significant losses developing. In order to properly assess what is a very complex issue, I have asked Forfas and Enterprise Ireland to expedite an analysis of the situation and my Department is working closely with them on this research. They will be reporting back to me by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">I should point out that this particular problem is not unique to Ireland.  The underlying reasons are linked to the global financial crisis and the lack of credit generally available.  Other EU Member States are facing similar problems and we have been engaging with them and with the European Commission, with a view to helping our understanding of the issues so that we can develop a fast and informed response.  I would like to ensure the Deputy that we are working quickly and thoroughly to establish the facts and set out the options.  I intend to bring this matter to the Cabinet as a priority, once I have received and considered the report being prepared for me.</p>

            <p eId="para_2206">The Director indicated in 2007 that having integrated these additional staff, he would review his request for further extra staff and advise my Department at that stage of the results of that review.  At this stage, there is no outstanding request for staffing resources from the Director.  I have indicated to the Director that I will be sympathetic to any reasonable request for extra resources which he may need to complete the present investigation of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">Loans to directors that are contrary to the provisions of the Companies Acts have been a particular area of focus for the Director, and his Office has experienced considerable success in having illegal loans repaid.  Further details are contained in its Annual Reports.  Civil or criminal enforcement action has also been taken in suitable cases.  For instance in 2008 following an ODCE investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions successfully prosecuted a company director for wilfully breaching the restrictions on directors' loans in the Companies Act 1990 ("the 1990 Act").  This was the first prosecution in the area of directors' loans to result in a criminal conviction.  Previous ODCE criminal prosecutions had concluded with the relevant District Court giving the defendants the benefit of the Probation Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">In addition, the existence of directors' loans in contravention of the relevant provisions of the 1990 Act has on some occasions been one of the factors on foot of which the High Court has seen fit to restrict or disqualify company directors in applications brought by the liquidators of insolvent companies.  However, so far as I am advised, no restriction declaration or disqualification order has ever been made on that basis alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">In 2006, the Director asked my Department to modify the evidential burden for a company law offence under Section 40 of the 1990 Act.  The matter was referred for detailed evaluation to the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) whose statutory function is to advise on companies legislation.  In its 2007 Report, the CLRG recommended that further consideration of the ODCE proposal be postponed until a broader policy discussion on the area was concluded.  I understand that while the Director accepted that recommendation, he still believes that this change is desirable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">In January this year, in light of events in the financial area, I asked the Director to consider whether any legislative improvements were necessary in the company law area.  The Director's response is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator.  I should point out that the Director has assured me that he is satisfied that he currently has the necessary powers to pursue his investigation into Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2219">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 85 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">The Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is designed to give effect to commitments in Part 2 of the 10 Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, to greatly increase public confidence in the system of employment law compliance.  The establishment of a new, statutory office — NERA — to secure better compliance with employment law through information and enforcement activities, supported by an enhanced Labour Inspectorate with extensive powers, formed one aspect of these commitments and is a central feature of the Bill.  The Bill is currently undergoing Second Stage reading in this house with further stages of the Bill in both Houses to follow and a target date for enactment in the first half of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">In terms of workplace inspections, the number carried out by NERA in 2008 was nearly twice the 2007 level — almost 28,000 workplace inspections in 2008 as against just fewer than 14,500 in 2007.  This increased level of inspection activity is of course reflective of the greater level of Inspectorate resources available to NERA which currently stand at seventy-nine as opposed to the original level of thirty one.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">Since it commenced operations on an interim basis in 2007, NERA has had considerable success in ensuring that abuses of workers rights and entitlements do not go unchecked.  Early in 2008, NERA undertook a nationwide information and awareness campaign which has been instrumental in bringing about a much greater level of awareness both by employers and by employees of the respective rights and obligations under employment law.  This information and awareness role continues to play a significant part in NERA's employment rights compliance and information strategy and is one that I believe will prove to be more beneficial in the longer term in bringing about a greater compliance culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">As regards the level of breaches detected in 2008 reported at 4,629 in NERA's 2008 annual review, this represented a virtual doubling of the level detected in 2007 — 2,344 and there is a symmetry between the increase in the level of inspections undertaken to the level of breaches detected.  It must be recalled that, where breaches are detected, NERA's primary objective is to seek compliance with the relevant legislation and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the individual/s concerned and payment of any arrears due to employees.  The fact that arrears due to employees totalling €3.1m were recovered in 2008 suggests that NERA has been successful in achieving compliance through negotiation with employers stressing compliance as opposed to the necessity to resort to institute prosecutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2225">The Irish economy is now one of the most globalised in the world. As a consequence, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on our economy. Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services. With that in mind, a range of policies are being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for both manufacturing and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">Maintaining the competitiveness of the enterprise sector in Ireland is a priority issue for my Department and our development agencies. In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">The "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", launched in 2008, identified the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland. The report sets out a number of recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, and increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. The Social Partners agreed, as part of the review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing. This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries. Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation. The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">I am determined to maintain and improve our focus on developing indigenous industry, where we are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets. The newly established Growth Fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland's small to medium sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity whilst also maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout all counties. I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which aims to promote a significant increase in exports sales in this sector by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">I also announced Enterprise Ireland's "Going Global Fund" which is aimed specifically at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.  The government is committed to ensuring that we continue to create an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world and which will position us for long term economic growth through the adoption of this series of proactive policies and strategies that best serve the interests of the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2243">In relation to Enterprise Ireland, the agency calculates the cost per job sustained by taking into account all of its expenditure in relation to all of its clients.  Only jobs created and sustained to the end of each seven-year period are taken into account in the calculations.  For the period 2000 to 2006, the figure was €3,907 and for the period 2001 to 2007, the figure was €6,111.  The figure for 2002 to 2008 will be available later in the year and will be published in the agency's 2008 Annual Report. The same system is used by IDA Ireland. The figure for 2000 to 2006 was €13,097 and the 2001 to 2007 figure was €12,577.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">A different system is used by the City and County Enterprise Boards ( CEBs). The estimated overall average cost per net job created in CEB assisted companies since the inception of the CEBs in 1993 to end 2006 was €5,413. The corresponding figure for the period 1993 to end 2007 was €5,486 and, for the period 1993 to end 2008, the figure was €5,949.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2246">Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with the relevant County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) are responsible for enterprise development in the regions in question.  The primary role of IDA Ireland is the attraction of high quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland. An integral and fundamental element of this role is the agency's mandate to promote sustainable and balanced regional development. However, the marketing of individual areas for FDI and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">However, I can say that the agency has invested heavily in the provision of property solutions tailored to meet the needs of investors and has developed a network of high-quality Business Parks in locations throughout both regions.  Advance planning permission for a Biopharmaceutical facility in Oranmore, Co Galway, the first of its kind in Ireland, has been obtained.  Considerable success has been achieved in attracting high quality investment to both regions.  At present there are a total of 119 IDA supported companies employing over 17,500 people between both regions. Furthermore, IDA has a good pipeline for 2009 and is hopeful of securing further investments across a number of locations.  The key sectors of focus are life sciences, information and communications technologies and high value services activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of programmes to address the multi-disciplinary demands of entrepreneurship and the diversity of business types. The agency supports companies to achieve productivity gains, internationalisation and export growth. It assists with research and development, management skills acquisition, market information and seed and venture capital. The agency also addresses micro businesses with support for incubation space in communities.  Between the two regions, the agency has almost 800 clients employing over 20,000 people.  In 2008, over €40 million was approved for the agency's client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">During 2008, the CEBs in the two regions paid out over €2.46m in grant assistance to 218 clients.  This year, the CEBs are continuing to support enterprise development through the provision of both direct financial assistance (in the form of capital, feasibility and employment grants) and through indirect or "soft support" assistance such as management development, capability support and the development and delivery of activities to highlight and promote enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">The Training and Employment agency FAS works very closely with the Industrial Development agencies and the CEBs in delivering its wide range of services.  I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being pursued by the Industrial Development agencies and the CEBs will continue to bring about industrial development and employment opportunities for the regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2258">The Consumer Protection Act 2007, which commenced in May 2007, empowers the National Consumer Agency to prepare and publish Guidelines to traders in relation to matters of consumer welfare and protection and matters related to commercial practices. The Consumer Protection Act 2007 also empowers the Agency to review or approve Codes of Practice submitted to it by traders or their trade associations where the Agency is satisfied that the Code of Practice protects consumer interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">The National Consumer Agency is currently giving priority to producing Guidelines for business in a number of areas In September 2008, the Agency published a consultation document on Guidelines on Advertising of Price Discounts and Related Matters. The Guidelines are intended to facilitate the retail sector in complying with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 in relation to a variety of trading practices. They will help traders to better appreciate their obligations to provide unambiguous information to consumers, give clarity on certain aspects of the Act and provide a basis for a fairer and more evenly balanced approach towards advertising throughout the sector. I understand that the Agency is close to finalizing the Guidelines and that it intends to publish them in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">In October 2008, the National Consumer Agency published Guidelines for the Leisure and Fitness Sector. The Guidelines are intended to help the sector to draw up clearer and fairer terms and conditions in consumer contracts. In tandem with the Guidelines, the Agency also published Seven Principles for the sector. These Principles, which are non-binding, are essentially a best practice guide for leisure clubs in the context of their contractual commitments to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2261">I very much support the Agency's initiatives in engaging constructively with businesses through the promotion of robust Codes of Practices. I understand that over time the Agency intends to further its activities in this area to cover other aspects of business activity. I am confident that initiatives of this nature will help to foster a more robust consumer culture which will be to the benefit of not only consumers but also businesses and indeed the economy as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_2263">The current global economic situation continues to change rapidly adding a considerable degree of uncertainty to the accuracy of forecasts, nationally and internationally.  There has however been a significant downturn in construction related activity since the beginning of 2008.  The most recent provisional data available from the Central Statistics Office indicates numbers employed in private firms in the construction industry decreased by 21.9% in December 2008 from December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">A lower level of residential investment was a key factor depressing activity in 2008 with completions of new homes amounting to c. 50,000, around one-third lower than in the previous year. The Department of Finance is projecting a further decline of around 60% in new house completions to a level of 20,000 units this year.  Other parts of construction — especially commercial — look set to decline also.  For the year as a whole, employment is forecast to decrease by 85,000 (-4.0%) with unemployment forecast to average 9.2%.  During 2009, the ESRI expect industrial (including building) output to fall by 5.8 per cent.  Within this figure, it is forecast that building output will decline by 25 per cent, as the house-building decline is compounded by a fall in commercial building.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">The availability of a pool of skilled contractors available to support major national and international companies and construction projects is an essential component for major investing companies.  The lack of availability of finance could restrict our ability to maintain current levels of activity or to attract investment from such companies in the future.  As part of the recapitalisation package announced by the Minister for Finance on 11 February 2009 the recapitalised banks have agreed to work closely with the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and with State agencies to ensure the supply of appropriate finance to contractors engaged on major projects sponsored by them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">The National Insulation Programme for Economic Recovery was launched by my colleagues the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Mr. John Gormley on 8 February, 2009.  This Government announcement of €100 million for this year will unlock the huge potential of energy efficiency for our economy. The three-strand insulation programme will cut heating bills for householders, reduce carbon emissions and create thousands of jobs both directly and indirectly over the course of 2009.  Energy efficiency/insulation programmes help provide for economic competitiveness, security of energy supply and tackle climate change. This energy efficiency stimulus programme will be divided into three packages, with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources taking a co-ordinating role.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">FÁS is currently developing a number of responses to the current slowdown in the economy as a whole including the construction sector.  Current initiatives include the creation of an additional 51,000 new training places under the FÁS Training Initiatives Strategy, the establishment of a training fund to enable timely identification of training and re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers and the continued provision of retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers.  FÁS will also continue to work in close collaboration with the Construction Industry Federation and other key stakeholders to encourage redundant construction workers to seek re-training in skills which are in short supply in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2276">The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated statutory provisions.  The number of workplace deaths reported to the Authority for the years 2002- 2008 are as follows — 57 in 2008; 67 in 2007; 51 in 2006; 74 in 2005; 50 in 2004; 68 in 2003 and 61 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">Non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority.  There were 6,998 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Authority in 2008.  This compares with 7,816 for 2007, 7,844 for 2006, 8,104 for 2005, 8,453 for 2004, 6,622 for 2003, and 7,746 for 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">While it is not possible to be satisfied that all accidents at workplaces are reported, I am not aware that the Authority has come across evidence that suggests underreporting of workplace accidents resulting in fatalities.  I recently approved the Authority's 2009 Programme of Work and I launched it earlier this month.  This new Programme sets out a comprehensive range of activities to make workplaces safer and it contains a good balance between prevention, advice and enforcement.  The Authority in 2009 intends to continue to focus on the high risk sectors of agriculture and construction, which have seen the highest proportions of fatalities in the last four years.  Of the 57 workplace fatalities reported to the Authority last year, the highest number (21) was in the agriculture sector, the second highest was in construction (15).</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">Day to day responsibility for workplace safety rests on the shoulders of employers and employees.  Safe workplaces can ultimately be only delivered by those who work in them.  When carrying out its inspection function, the Authority spends a lot of its time advising as to safety at work and safe systems of work. In general, this advice is well received and it is only where there is a failure to comply with advice or a real and immediate threat to health and safety does the Authority commence enforcement procedures.  The Authority publishes guidelines, codes of practice and other advice on safety on a regular basis as well as organising sectoral seminars or conferences to promote the occupational safety and health message, as part of its advocacy role. These activities, together with the information on the Authority's website, are of critical importance to all those in the workplace if Ireland's safety record is to be improved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2377">The relationship between Ireland and the United States is unique in terms of our political, economic and cultural links. The Government and I attach the highest importance to strengthening that relationship and in consolidating and growing the economic partnership between our two countries.  That partnership has contributed enormously to the very significant trade and investment ties with the United States. These ties benefit us both and generate investment and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">We are always mindful of the need to continually update and renew the links between our two countries. This is especially important at this time in terms of the new US Administration.  Together with the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs, my Department is working in close collaboration with the Embassy in seeking to address various policy proposals including those in relation to taxation which could affect foreign direct investment in Ireland. Issues that may have implications for Ireland are subject to focussed discussion with US policymakers within the overall framework of a shared commitment to promoting the consolidation and growth of our economic relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">There has been a lot of discussion around the potential impact on Ireland of changes in US international taxation policy.  The new Administration has not given any real indication of its main focus in terms of international taxation and therefore it has not been possible to determine if there are consequences for job creation. However, any re-evaluation cannot ignore the substantial real two-way investment between our countries nor indeed the importance of international taxation policy to the competitiveness of US companies seeking to grow their business in Europe and beyond. We will be working to ensure that such considerations feed into the new Administration's deliberations in terms of the development of its international taxation policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2381">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer (micro-enterprises) in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2382">The forms of financial assistance which are available from the CEB network, subject to certain criteria, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants, and Feasibility Study Grants. The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.  During 2004, an important review of the role and functions of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the development of micro-enterprises, including the level of financial assistance which they have available to them was conducted on behalf of the Department by Fitzpatricks and Associates. This Review recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should:</p>
            <p eId="para_2383">focus more on economic objectives rather than social or local development</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">that the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">and that there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">The report of the Small Business Forum published in 2006, further endorsed the key recommendations of the Fitzpatricks Report in relation to the primary micro-enterprise focus of CEB support and assistance.  While it is acknowledged that there will be differences in requirements and emphasis in the areas served by the various CEBs, the Department is satisfied that the current micro-enterprise remit of the CEBs should remain their primary focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">In the context of its key policy role my Department, in association with the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland (CCU), and with the CEB network, monitors the level of funding and is reviewing the range of support services offered by the CEBs in the light of the current economic climate.  The Capital Allocation to the CEBs for 2009 is €20.8 for provision of supports to micro-enterprise. In 2009 the Boards will continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2392">I have not made any comment to the effect that I consider that the national minimum wage should be lowered. What I said was that, whatever, rate applies, it is important that the national minimum wage is not a barrier to employment. Protection of jobs must be our top priority and I think all sides accept that as the key goal. This is also the view of the Tánaiste.</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">I understand that in November 2008, ICTU requested the Labour Court to review the national minimum wage and to make a recommendation to me concerning its adjustment.  The Court subsequently invited submissions on the issue. Various submissions were received, including from IBEC, ICTU and the Department of Finance. The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties.  I understand that the matter is still under consideration by the Court.  If the Labour Court is satisfied that a general agreement has been reached between the parties as to an appropriate minimum wage, it will recommend the rate agreed to me.  If, after these consultations, there is no general agreement, the Labour Court can still make a recommendation to me. However, in doing so, the Labour Court must have regard to the movement of earnings of employees, the relevant exchange rate movement and the likely impact on employment, unemployment, inflation and national competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">It would be inappropriate for me to enter into discussions with either employer or trade union bodies while the Labour Court is engaged in a process of consultation with these bodies.  When it comes to considering a Labour Court recommendation in relation to the minimum wage, I am required under the Act to take into account the impact that the proposed rate may have on employment, the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness. In other words, the key consideration is to ensure that the national minimum wage is set at an appropriate rate.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2400">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 106, 124, 130 and 131 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">I very much regret the announced closure of the SR Technics operation at Dublin Airport.  My most recent meeting on the matter was on Thursday last, 19 February, with a delegation representing the Trade Union interests in the Dublin operation, who outlined their concerns. Similar concerns have been relayed to me in the many approaches I have had from public representatives.  The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport. We would like to see the SR Technics Group do what it can to facilitate this, such as helping to promote the capabilities and skills available at the Dublin facility, agreeing to an orderly wind down of the facility to give IDA Ireland an opportunity to promote the location to interested parties, and maintaining assets and equipment at the site for at least 6 months. There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in possibly all or part of the business and time is needed to assess these proposals. The Government is anxious that the facility and the workers will maintain their IAA approval status while the alternative proposals are being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">I am conveying these points, and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at Group level, as a follow-on to my meeting with the company on 11th February, when I was accompanied by my Secretary General and the Chief Executive of IDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2403">I should add that a number of meetings had taken place between the State, its Agencies and the company in the past year.  The company had explained that it had been exploring all options for its Dublin operations, including sale to another party, but had not found it possible to proceed with any of these options.  The company outlined the deterioration that had taken place in its global business since mid 2008, with contracts moving to Eastern Europe, Jordan, Turkey and Malta. It confirmed that it was putting in place a 5 year restructuring plan and that it had already reduced its worldwide workforce by 500 in the last year.  The company stated that the recent loss of major contracts, its current business and economic forecasts, as well as its high cost-base and over capacity at Dublin airport, had made it impossible to continue a sustainable business in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">SR Technics provides line maintenance for the Aer Lingus fleet at their Dublin base.  This is a long-term contract awarded by Aer Lingus in 2008 following a competitive procurement process.  The Company had indicated that it hoped to assign this and other smaller operations to another operator, offering the potential of saving up to 200 jobs.  IDA Ireland has had an ongoing relationship with the company over many years and approved a significant Training Grant package for the company in 2006 to assist the company in maximising efficiencies and improving competitiveness.   IDA also had discussions with the company in relation to its business plan and further opportunities to assist the company with additional financial incentives such as RD&amp;I support with the emphasis on Innovation and Process Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">In the light of the announced closure of the Dublin plant, FÁS has been at the forefront in providing intervention and support to employees facing redundancy.  It is currently in contact with SR Technics Management to discuss the services available from FÁS and the potential needs of the employees.  Each response will be tailored on a case-by-case basis.  FÁS Services to Business Unit will also be involved in these consultations. It is important to establish how best FÁS can assist the workers.  Following this initial contact, a judgement will be made in relation to the level of FÁS intervention required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">As regards efforts to save some or all of the jobs involved, actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support for an undertaking in the normal way. In the meantime IDA Ireland are actively exploring options with interest parties.  As regards the issue of aircraft hangars and any leasing arrangements between the DAA and SR Technics, it is not the practice to discuss details concerning commercial transactions of IDA client companies while issues relating to the DAA are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_2408">Trade unions holding a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment. Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntarist approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State. The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The State has sought to facilitate the bargaining process through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes, including the Labour Relations Commission/Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court. There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntarist system in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively. The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements. In addition, the 2004 Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and where the internal dispute resolution procedures that are normally used fail to resolve the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">The issue of employee representation was considered with the social partners in the context of the 2008 review of Towards 2016.  In that context, the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 provides for the establishment of a review process which will consider the legal and other steps which are required to enable the mechanisms which were established under previous Agreements to operate as they had been intended. This review, which will be carried out under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach, is expected to commence shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2412">Following the repeal of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 in March 2006, the Competition Authority was requested to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  As I have previously indicated to the Dáil, the Competition Authority presented two reports in March 2008, as part of the Grocery Monitor Project.  The first report, A Description of the Structure and Operation of Grocery Retailing and Wholesaling in Ireland: 2001 to 2006 provides a description of the market structure at the wholesale and retail levels of the Irish grocery sector.

In this report, the Competition Authority has considered the impact of the removal of the Groceries Order by examining the evolution of the aggregate retail grocery price trends between 2001 and 2007 by analysis of price data published by the CSO.  These reports were noted by Government in April 2008 and were published by the Authority shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">A third Report, ‘Retail Planning System as applied to the Grocery Sector 2001-2007', was published by the Authority in September 2008.  This report identifies a number of features of the retail planning system that affect competition in the grocery sector. It contains seven recommendations aimed at promoting competition in grocery retailing in Ireland.  These recommendations are addressed to my colleague the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr John Gormley, who has indicted his intention to initiate a review of the retail planning guidelines during 2009. The Authority's Reports do not call for changes to legislation which fall within my area of responsibility and I have no plans to introduce legislation in this area.  I would like to advise the Deputy that the three Reports are available on the Authority's website www.tca.ie.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_565">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2417">I propose to take Questions Nos. 102, 103 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">In December 2008, I met with  Mr. Michael Dell, Chairman and CEO of Dell Inc. in Austin, Texas. Mr. Dell was accompanied by a number of his senior managers. I was accompanied by the Minister for Defence, the Secretary General of my Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and by the Chief Executive of IDA Ireland.  The purpose of the meeting was to seek an update on implementation of Dell's new corporate strategy and in particular the company's plans for the future of their operations in Ireland, in particular in Limerick.  At the meeting, the company confirmed that it was pushing ahead with its cost saving plan and that weakening demand and associated cost pressures continued to put pressure on the company to implement its new strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">I communicated to the company the significant benefits which the Limerick operation brings to the company, the city and the region. I undertook, on behalf of the Government, to provide whatever assistance I could to Dell with a view to retaining a significant Dell presence in Limerick and maximising its future presence there.  For its part the company expressed its wish to continue to work with the IDA and the Government, and agreed to contact us as soon as it had finalised its detailed plans for the Limerick operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">Following the announcement by Dell to reduce its Limerick workforce, I announced the creation of a Task Force to address the affect of the Dell decision at a regional level. The Task Force, which is chaired by Mr. Denis Brosnan and has Mr. Vincent Cunnane of Shannon Development as CEO, is already under way and it held its first meeting in Limerick some weeks ago.  I am meeting the Task Force later this week and, in its work, the Task Force can call on support and inputs from my Department, Forfás and the Industrial Development agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">I have met with all of the State development agencies, under the auspices of my Department, in the context of the job losses to take place at Dell as well as other job losses in the Region, and I am satisfied that they are working in a fully coordinated manner to take the appropriate actions to support the workers at Dell in finding new employment, including assistance to re-skill and re-train to enhance their future employment potential.  In this respect, IDA has been working diligently to secure new investments and over the last year companies like Vistakon, Zimmer, Cook, DTS and Microsemi have had announcements in the Region.   The Agency currently has a pipeline of projects under consideration. These potential investments are being pursued and IDA Ireland will do everything possible to speed up the investment decisions in Limerick's favour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">The investment projects which IDA is seeking to attract to Limerick today are much different to those of the past, relying principally on the skills of its people and on a strong business and educational infrastructure to pull investment to the county.  IDA's strategy is to re-position the region as a hotspot for knowledge based industry, while focusing on marketing Limerick as a key location for investment by building on the strengths already evident in the county. IDA is also working closely with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as R&amp;D, customer support and back office functions.  IDA works closely with Shannon Development in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Enterprise Ireland is specifically targeting potential business start-ups through the following supports &amp; programmes:</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">Dedicated Opportunities Fair to be held in March in Limerick to encompass all Enterprise, Employment and Education institutions together with private and voluntary sector organisations including financial Institutions, Mabs, Citizens Information and recruitment agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">New collaborative Information brochure detailing contacts, business Start-Up supports and financial assistance available via EI and the CEBs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">New series of one &amp; two night seminars &amp; workshops throughout the Mid-West commencing in March to provide individuals with information on enterprise start &amp; identification of new business opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">A new EI led 6 week part-time Enterprise Start Programme to commence at the EI funded Enterprise Acceleration Centre at LIT in February to facilitate individuals to explore Business Start-Up as a new career option.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">A new 12 month Enterprise Platform Programme to commence at LIT in April to assist individuals to commercialise existing business ideas</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">One-to-one meeting facility for individuals interested in business start-up from locally based EI regional development executives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">In addition, EI is addressing the challenges facing the sub-supply base in the Mid-west with a dedicated sub-supplier event in April to facilitate supply companies to explore new opportunities, new business leads &amp; new markets with assistance from EI's overseas market network.</p>
            <p eId="para_2431">In preparation for job losses at Dell, FÁS Mid-west had put in place a team to deal specifically with redundancies in Dell and other companies in the Region.  As an initial step, the following services have been offered to Dell employees:</p>
            <p eId="para_2432">Group Briefing Sessions for staff to outline the range of FÁS Services available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2433">Individual one to one guidance interviews to include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2434">Identification of current qualifications and job requirements.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2435">Provision of information on job opportunities, Mid-west, national and EU</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2436">Identification of upskilling training requirements</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2437">Provision of a broad range of training programmes in response.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2439">Referral to Enterprise Boards regarding Start Your Own Business initiatives, where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">FÁS will be hosting Training/Job Opportunities events in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.  These events will have local, national and European vacancies on display as well as employers in attendance. Also, FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the City and County Enterprise Boards, University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology have now  developed a web portal to assist people who find themselves out of work in the Mid-West.   This web portal will guide people through the initial orientation process into new opportunities.  Through this coordinated approach, the affiliated organisations are ensuring that no valuable time is lost and people will get clear and comprehensive individual guidance.  The web portal will provide information and direct access to designated contact people within the organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2442">NERA currently has in place a team of seventy-nine inspectors.  Recruitment competitions were held to bring the number of Inspectors from the original level of thirty one inspectors up to the level of ninety committed to under Towards 2016.

Twelve inspectors left NERA over the past year as a result of promotion, internal and external Departmental transfers and, re-assignments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2443">All new inspectors are required to complete the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and to undertake further training, including on-the-job training with experienced inspectors.  This involves working with experienced inspectors carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.    Fifty-nine of the sixty new inspectors have completed the Introductory Training Programme and are now actively involved in inspection duties.  One inspector has recently taken up duty and will commence training shortly.  A competitive selection process was held very recently to form a panel of people who will fill current and future inspector vacancies as they arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_2445">I welcome the report on FÁS by the Public Accounts Committee, which was published last week and I commend the Committee for the work carried out in this matter. I will be paying particular attention to the recommendations made and to the underlying rationale for making them.  I note that while the report in general concentrates on the things that went wrong, the Committee is of the view that the good work being done by the employees of FÁS should not be overlooked and this examination is no reflection on their role and the valuable contribution they make to Irish life. I fully concur with this view.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">Many of the issues contained in the report have already been aired in public. I have previously expressed my concerns in respect of various matters raised by internal audit reports in FÁS and subsequently taken up by the C&amp;AG in an earlier report on a number of public bodies. Since the publication of those reports a series of steps have been undertaken to deal with the matters raised. In particular:</p>
            <p eId="para_2447">FÁS has clarified its procedures and strengthened its internal controls;</p>
            <p eId="para_2448">An internal cross-functional communications and marketing strategy group has been established in FÁS;</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">FÁS has passed certain issues to the Gardaí for investigation;</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">A new Director General has been appointed on a temporary basis;</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">The C&amp;AG has commenced a wide-ranging investigation in FÁS, which includes internal controls, governance arrangements, marketing and advertising and specific follow-up of matters raised in the course of hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts;</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">A review of the Science Challenge Initiative with a view to making recommendations on the Initiative's future is currently underway, and it will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">In my view, FÁS should continue to remain focused on its core mission, given the employment and training challenges currently facing the country. I would express my strong support for the work of the new Director General, the Chairman and the other members of the Board in that regard.  The Board of FÁS has already stated that whatever additional actions are necessary arising from the Report will be fully implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_2459">I attach in Table 1 are the amount of monies paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2002-2008 up to and including 13 February, 2009.  It should be noted that the figures provided for 2008 and to date in 2009 are provisional figures.  It is not possible to project the figure for 2009 given that this will hinge on a number of variables including the number of claims received, the length of service of the claimants etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">Table 2 sets out the number of statutory redundancies for years 2002 to 2008 and details for 2009 which are provisional figures (up to 18 February, 2009).  These figures show the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.   While I am unable to provide a projection of the number of projected redundancies in 2009, it may be helpful to the Deputy to report that in the first almost seven weeks of this year, the level of new claims received averaged in excess of 1,500 per week.</p>

The manner in which the reduction in professional fees is to be applied is currently being considered by the Department of Finance.  My Department will follow the instructions of the Department of Finance on the matter and, if appropriate, the savings to be achieved in respect of my Department will be reflected in the Revised Estimates Volume to be published in March.</p>

            <p eId="para_2591">The Government is determined to do all in its power to tackle the rise in numbers of people finding themselves without work or with reduced working weeks.  Our approach in tackling the issue is multi-faceted and centres on restoring our public finances, protecting employment across the economy, re-training those without work and attracting new investment and jobs to our shores.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">The Department of Social and Family Affairs fund a number of Schemes which provide a subsidy to a person's wage. These include employment supports available to persons in receipt of welfare payments that are designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.  Included in these measures is the Back to Work Allowance (BTWA).  The BTWA scheme is designed to assist the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to work.  There are two strands to the scheme, the Back to Work Enterprise allowance for the self-employed and the Back to Work Allowance for employees.  These allowances provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependant long-term on social welfare payments to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">Financial support is also available to those who are engaged in short-time employment through the payment of Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance in respect of those days that the person is unemployed.  In addition to that outlined above, my Department, through FÁS, funds and operates a Wage Subsidy Scheme that provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">Finally, I can say that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan, has asked the Commission for Energy Regulation for an immediate review of energy pricing and an analysis of options for bringing down electricity and gas prices for householders and businesses.  Such action sends out a clear signal that in Government we are addressing issues of real concern to employers who need to get costs down in order to compete effectively in the global marketplace, resulting in more jobs being protected across our economy.  It is one example of the many steps that we are in the process of taking to best protect the long term sustainability of our economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2596">The current Irish law in the area of "transfer of undertakings" is the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 — Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 131 of 2003.  The Regulations implement the mandatory (i.e mandatory to transpose) provisions of EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 which is aimed at safeguarding the rights of employees in the event of a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer (including the assignment or forfeiture of a lease) or merger.  Section 21 of the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006 transposed a provision of the European Directive relating to the information to be provided by the original employer to the new employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2597">It is open to individuals to seek legal advice to determine, in any case, if the specifics of their particular situation might constitute a Transfer of Undertaking.

            <p eId="para_2598">While my Department cannot provide legal advice in respect of any specific case, I would point out that the European Commission has issued a guidance document on European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings in the area of transfer of undertakings and outsourcing or contracting-out.  That document indicates that the ECJ has found that in a situation where a services contract for a labour-intensive service such as office cleaning or security services (as distinct from an assets-based service such as public transport where other rulings apply) has been outsourced and where the contract subsequently moves to a new contractor, it may be considered a "transfer of undertakings" for the purposes of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive if the new employer takes over a major part, in terms of their numbers and skills, of the employees specially assigned by the previous contractor to the provision of the services in point.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">However, as indicated above, the circumstances of each individual case would have to be considered by a Rights Commissioner, in the first instance, in the light of all previous case law, including ECJ case law.  Any such case should be taken within six months of the date on which an employee considers that there has been a contravention of the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations.  An application to a Rights Commissioner can be made by the employee, or by a representative (including a trade union representative) by contacting the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission, Tom Johnston House, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, or phone 01 6136700.</p>

            <p eId="para_2606">I launched the Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme on 29th December 2008. The scheme provides support to employers to provide on-the-job training to redundant apprentices while they have released their employed apprentice to a scheduled Phase 4 or Phase 6 off-the-job training phase in the Institutes of Technology. A total of €4 million has been allocated to the scheme to provide up to 500 on-the-job training places during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2607">To be eligible for the Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme, employers must not have made an apprentice redundant in the period since 1st January 2007.  This eligibility criteria is to ensure that employers, who have demonstrated a strong commitment to the apprentice in the completion of their apprenticeship, would be supported by taking a redundant apprentice into their employment to enable the redundant apprentice to complete their on-the-job training.  There are over 2,200 employers for the trades of Bricklaying, Carpentry and Joinery, Electrical, Plastering and Plumbing who are eligible to participate in the Scheme for the rotation period now commencing for the April term.</p>

            <p eId="para_2614">Management capability development, specifically dealing with running a growth oriented business</p>
            <p eId="para_2615">Access to professional mentors with sectoral knowledge in domestic and international markets</p>

            <p eId="para_2619">On 10 February 2008, Enterprise Ireland co-hosted a half-day conference with Retail Excellence Ireland.  This allowed Enterprise Ireland to present the supports available and afforded retailers the opportunity for one-to-one contact with Enterprise Ireland staff to discuss international prospects.  I would also encourage any business in the retail sector, or other sectors, to consider the opportunities of the all-island market place to expand their business. InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body, provides practical advice and support to businesses to help them pursue new cross-border business opportunities, develop new products and processes and to attract equity investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2626">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2627">The Irish economy is now one of the most globalised in the world. As a consequence, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on our economy. Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services. With that in mind, a range of policies is being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2628">Competition, both for investment and goods and services in the global economic environment that Irish business functions in, is keener than ever. Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it, are the new foundations for competitiveness. In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation. Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2629">The "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", launched in 2008, identified the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland. The report sets out a number of recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, and increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. The Social Partners agreed, as part of the review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing. This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2630">I am determined to maintain and improve our focus on developing indigenous industry, where we are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets. The newly established Growth Fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland's small to medium sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity whilst also maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout the country. I also recently announced Enterprise Ireland's "Going Global Fund" which is aimed specifically at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2631">In the area of foreign direct investment (FDI), Ireland still manages to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment. While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs. The pipeline of new business, for which IDA Ireland is competing, is strong and we remain confident that Ireland will manage to secure significant investment from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharma, Medical Technologies and Information and Communications Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_2632">The government is committed to ensuring that we continue to create an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world and which will position us for long term economic growth through the adoption of this series of proactive policies and strategies that best serve the interests of the manufacturing sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2634">In 2008 there were 90,342 persons in permanent employment in Enterprise Agency-assisted International Traded and Financial Services firms; the attached Table shows the number of full-time jobs created and lost in similar sectoral firms between 2004 and 2008.  As one of the most globalised economies in the world, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on the Irish economy. This has created strains in the labour market that reflect the present international economic downturn. Our comparative advantage will increasingly lie in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services. With that in mind, a range of policies are being pursued to enhance competitiveness and improve the business environment for services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2635">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries. Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation. The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Three strategic aims for future services policy in Ireland are identified in the report:</p>
            <p eId="para_2636">Realising the opportunities to further grow and diversify Irish services exports;</p>
            <p eId="para_2637">Encouraging internationalisation, where Irish service enterprises establish operations in overseas markets;</p>
            <p eId="para_2638">Recognising the important role of Irish service enterprises that trade locally on the domestic market, and ensuring that these are efficient and productive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2639">Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2640">I am determined to maintain and improve our focus on developing indigenous industry, where we are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets. The newly established Growth Fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland's small to medium sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential. This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity whilst also maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout all counties. I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which aims to promote a significant increase in exports sales in this sector by 2015. I also announced Enterprise Ireland's "Going Global Fund" which is aimed specifically at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">We are fully committed to strengthening the competitiveness and productive capacity of the economy. Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.

            <p eId="para_2663">Ireland is currently experiencing an economic downturn and a general slowdown in employment in all sectors.  Indeed many countries throughout Europe and around the world are experiencing similar difficulties in their labour markets.  The global economic turmoil makes it difficult to predict the outcome for job creation in 2009.  The Government is, however, taking specific measures to address the economic downturn and to ensure that job creation is optimised in 2009.  Specifically the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department are working to hard ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2664">Global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) will decline and almost all economic commentators are predicting a difficult year in 2009.  However, on a daily basis, IDA is working closely with its clients in making every effort to keep them operating in Ireland while minimising the job losses encountered.  It is important to recognise that even in turbulent economic times there is still FDI to be won and our competitors will not be slow in targeting opportunities. A firm focus and a positive attitude in our ability to win FDI, by all stakeholders, are key ingredients to a successful outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">For indigenous industry it is extremely difficult to predict an outcome for 2009 given the difficult circumstances Enterprise Ireland (EI) clients are operating in.  However, EI is focused on supporting clients to maximise export sales and consequently employment, by continuing to invest in companies to help them plan strategy, build capability, access markets and research, finance start-ups and innovation. Success in securing export sales will be a key driver of job creation and sustainability in 2009.  In addition, during 2009 the County and City Enterprise Boards will continue to support enterprise development and job creation through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance to micro-enterprises and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_2669">The current economic climate is creating difficult trading conditions for all sectors of the economy, including the retail sector. In these circumstances it is all the more important that we ensure that Irish businesses remain competitive so that they can compete in the marketplace. In this regard I am fully conscious of the findings of the recent Forás report into the retail sector which showed that in a number of areas operating costs in this jurisdiction were higher than in the neighbouring jurisdiction of Northern Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2670">As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am fully committed to ensuring that we tackle those areas of our cost base which are affecting our national competitiveness and our ability to compete. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of developments in the area of energy prices with the recent announcement of greater competition for domestic users and the engagement by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with energy companies in relation to energy costs for larger commercial users. These initiatives are intended to ensure that there will be significant reductions in energy prices across the board before the end of the year.   Such  reduction in energy costs will clearly be of significant assistance in protecting employment and maintaining business activities. In addition, the Government has committed under the Framework for Economic Renewal to examining other cost factors such as charges at local level, which I am aware is a particular concern for the retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2671">In so far as my Department is concerned, a key priority of the Department is to reduce the administrative burden on Irish business by 25%, or €500 million per annum, by the end of 2012. The new Companies Consolidation Bill will radically overhaul company law in Ireland and consolidate the existing thirteen Companies Acts into one. This will result in a further reduction in red tape and cost for business and will improve Ireland's competitive position as a location for business investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">It is important that we renew our focus on tackling those factors which are eroding our competitiveness. Government, businesses, employees and consumers all have a role to play in helping to restore our competitiveness and thereby ensuring that we can continue to have a vibrant economy with thriving sectors, including the retail sector, providing valuable employment, increasing the level of trade and contributing to the national exchequer. The initiatives outlined above demonstrate the Government's intentions to play its role in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2674">The latest forecasts from the Department of Finance, as set out in the January Stability Programme Update, indicate that job losses will exceed gains with employment contracting by around 85,000 or 4% for the year as a whole.   Notwithstanding this the level of employment in the economy will be close to 2 million as a result of the substantial employment gains made since the mid-1990's.  Unemployment is forecast to continue to rise this year and to average 9.2% for the year as a whole.  In the current global economic climate, multinational companies are restructuring their global operations leading to global job cuts.  Ireland therefore will inevitably be affected.  On a daily basis, IDA is working with its Clients making every effort to keep Clients operating in Ireland while minimising the job losses encountered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2675">Enterprise Ireland (EI) is working hard to retain jobs in existing companies by improving competitiveness and access to overseas markets and focusing on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in setting up new high potential start up companies.   In recognising the significant changes in the current economy EI is currently in the process of finalising its revised Strategy and Client Offer.  In the interim Enterprise Ireland continues to operate under its strategy Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010 which is focused on Growth, Innovation and Leadership Development.  During 2009 Enterprise Ireland will continue to work on expanding the positions that clients have won to-date in overseas markets and will be putting additional focus on capitalising on emerging opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2676">In addition, during 2009 the County and City Enterprise Boards will continue to support enterprise development and job creation through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance to micro-enterprises and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_2678">In relation to manufacturing and internationally traded services, IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  IDA's main focus on securing investment from new and existing clients is in the areas of High End Manufacturing, Global Services (including Financial Services) and Research, Development and Innovation.  In addition IDA is focusing on new sectors such as Clean Tech, Services Innovation and Convergence.  IDA is confident that there are further FDI opportunities for Ireland in these key sectors, which will be augmented in the future by a number of emerging technologies and new business models.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">IDA has developed a strong base of existing clients, which make a significant contribution to the wealth generation and development of the Irish Economy.  Furthermore, these companies have had a positive impression in Ireland and this provides a solid basis for future growth.  IDA continues to work with its existing client base to deepen and further embed their investments in Ireland.  It has an active programme of engagement with clients to identify and target new investment opportunities from these clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">Ireland is now seen by the global business environment as a prime location for Research Development and Innovation functions.  IDA has played a key role in establishing this competitive advantage for Ireland and is heavily involved with all stakeholders in the RD&amp;I space.  The increase in the R&amp;D tax credit available to companies, which was announced in the Budget last December, will increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location for R&amp;D activity and will provide a well-targeted stimulus for such value-added activities. R&amp;D in Ireland has expanded dramatically in recent years reflecting the Irish government's massive injection of funding into the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2681">In an effort to drive business development and secure further foreign direct investment, IDA has recently undertaken a number of initiatives including a 10% shift in resources from non-business generation to business generation. The Agency has opened new offices in the United States and, from within existing resources, has expanded by 20% the number of its people in the United States and has deployed extra resources in London and Frankfurt.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">In an effort to diversify the source of foreign direct investment, IDA opened a new office in Mumbai last year to target Indian investment.  At the same time the Agency continues to explore opportunities to market Ireland for FDI in emerging economies in areas such a China, Russian Federation and Brazil.  In addition the Agency continues to provide novel and tailored property solutions to prospective investors through its strategic sites initiative and by the development of business parks throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2683">Despite the credit crunch, Ireland has continued to attract significant high end FDI.  In 2008 there was a 14% increase over the previous year in the number of investments secured. IDA remains guardedly optimistic of Ireland's ability to continue attracting high level of FDI in 2009 and beyond.  In fact, 2009 has shown some success already with a number of new investments won that have a potential to create 200 jobs.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2685">My Department, through FÁS, is taking a number of steps in order to meet the greater demands arising from the economic downturn.  In the context of job search supports, FÁS is working to provide sufficient front-line staff in the National Employment Service to provide for a major increase during 2009 of Employment Action Plan (EAP) referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs as well as unemployed persons seeking job search assistance voluntarily.  The aim is for a combined FÁS/Local Employment Service (LES) capacity of 147,000 EAP interviews, as well as other redundant and caseload clients.  This will be achieved, in the main, by the LES providing, for the first time, a large-scale direct referral capacity for EAP clients.   In addition, FÁS has begun the process of increasing its own Employment Services capacity by the internal redeployment of staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2686">In respect of services for those interviewed by the Employment Service, Job Clubs are being re-focussed on assisting those who are ‘job-ready' to find work.  In addition to this, overseas jobs will be highlighted through the European Employment Service (EURES).</p>
            <p eId="para_2687">Regarding training programmes, I recently announced the availability of 51,000 new training places under the FÁS Training Initiatives Strategy.  These places are in addition to the 27,000 previously planned for 2009 under the Bridging Foundation Training, Specific Skills Training and Traineeships Programmes.  These programmes will provide short training courses for those who have recently become unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2688">The Training Initiative Strategy enhances the traditional mix of course offerings and will be delivered through three core-training initiatives, Short Courses, Night Courses and Online Courses.  The courses are for highly employable persons who wish to add to their existing skills set and improve their prospects of re-entering the labour market.  The night courses offer further flexibility and the online courses provide an excellent option for those who need a fast flexible intervention and who prefer a self directed E learning and blended learning environment.  To ensure that the training offered remains highly relevant to the needs of the labour market, FÁS has also been looking at updating the content of certain training initiatives.  This has resulted in the introduction of new courses for redundant construction workers in developing environmental/energy areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">FÁS has also responded to the increase in the level of redundant apprentices especially in the construction and related sectors by providing the following supports:</p>
            <p eId="para_2690">The Department of Social and Family Affairs immediately refer redundant apprentices to FÁS for assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2691">Following this immediate referral, the FÁS Employment Services and FÁS Services to Business Divisions work in collaboration to provide guidance and support in sourcing a new employer and to consider further options. FÁS has amended the scheduling rules for off-the-job training to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training, at Phase 2, Phase 4 and Phase 6, in accordance with the existing scheduling criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2692">FÁS introduced an Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme to provide support for employers to provide on-the-job training to redundant apprentices when they have released their employed apprentice to a scheduled Phase 4 and Phase 6 off-the-job training phase in the Institutes of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">Leargas have provided funding under the EU's Leonardo da Vinci programme to support the placement of 26 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their Phase 7 on-the-job training assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">ESB Networks have agreed a programme with FÁS to provide on-the-job training to eligible redundant electrical apprentices at Phase 5 and Phase 7. This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of eighteen months and will be funded by ESB Networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">Finally, redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses, which are trade related to enhance their employable skills and they may also avail of a range of trade-related night courses, which are available in FÁS training centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_2697">Maintaining the competitiveness of the enterprise sector in Ireland is a priority issue for my Department and our development agencies. In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2698">In the course of my engagements, I have met a wide array of people, representative of all sectors and levels of the Irish economy. All of these meetings deepen my own and my Department's understanding of the particular concerns and difficulties of those operating in the current economic environment. The Irish economy is now one of the most globalised in the world. As a consequence, the uncertainty created by the current international financial crisis has had a significant impact on our economy. Paramount amongst my concerns, and those of the Government, is how to sustain and create employment in these difficult times. The challenge is to create the conditions in which the different sectors can best prosper and avail of an economic upturn when it materialises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2699">In 2008, my Department facilitated the development of two reports examining in a detailed manner the attributes and needs of the Manufacturing and Services sectors, respectively, with a view to developing strategies for their success in the future.  The "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", identified the focused actions needed by employers, employees and Government to respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities to further develop the sector in Ireland. The report sets out a number of recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, and increasing awareness and take up of existing supports. The Social Partners agreed, as part of the review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing. This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2700">We continue to be one of the world's leading service exporting countries. Over the next ten years, services will be one of the key drivers of Ireland's economic success and job creation. The report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave:  A Services Strategy for Ireland", sets out new policy proposals on how we can ensure the continued development and growth of Ireland's services sector and outlines how to maximise the future returns to the country from services activities in all enterprises, both current and potential. Implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group — some of which are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies — will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2701">I am determined to maintain and improve our focus on developing indigenous industry, where we are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets. The newly established Growth Fund is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland's small to medium sized clients achieve greater competitiveness by improving their export potential.  This will be achieved by increasing gross output and productivity whilst also maintaining existing employment levels in clients throughout all counties. I recently launched Enterprise Ireland's strategy for the internationalisation of Ireland's services sector, which aims to promote a significant increase in exports sales in this sector by 2015. I also announced Enterprise Ireland's "Going Global Fund" which is aimed specifically at locally traded companies that have successfully established businesses in Ireland and wish to explore opportunities to sell abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2702">The government is committed to ensuring that we continue to create an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world and which will position us for long term economic growth through the adoption of this series of proactive policies and strategies that best serve the interests of the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>

Having examined the completed documentation and the evidence supporting both the date of acquisition of that vehicle and the date of transfer of residence, Revenue granted the VRT exemption based on 2 January 2008 as the transfer date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2717">By virtue of Statutory Instrument No. 59 of 1993, paragraph 4(5)(b), VRT exemption on the grounds of transfer of residence cannot be granted if such exemption was availed of in the previous five years.  Furthermore, to qualify for VRT exemption on transfer of residence, the applicant must have had possession of and used the vehicle outside the State for at least six months prior to transfer.  One of the two vehicles that was refused the exemption was only acquired one month before the persons' declared date of transfer of residence while the second vehicle was acquired one week after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2718">On the basis of the details supplied in respect of the two vehicles in question at present, indicative VRT liabilities of €862 and €2,385 respectively apply.  The final VRT liabilities cannot be determined until the vehicles are inspected by Revenue.  Sligo Vehicle Registration Office has been in recent communication with the person in question and, having regard to his circumstances, arrangements are being made to inspect the vehicles at a location close to his residence for his convenience.</p>

In addition, persons who are full medical card holders are exempt from the income levy.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in the Deputy's question is over the age of 65 and the income received from the superannuation pension exceeds the threshold limit, which makes her liable to pay the 1% income levy.

            <p eId="para_2728">I would point out to the Deputy that the reply below is in respect of my own Department and offices under the remit of my Department only.  My other ministerial colleagues will provide the information separately in respect of their own Departments.  By employment I understand the Deputy to refer to the full or part time employment of retired civil servants as part of the staffing of the Department.   In this regard, I am not aware of any such cases in my Department.  Retired civil servants are however engaged by the Department and some of the Offices under my Department's remit, from time to time for specific tasks or projects.  Such engagements are normally remunerated on a fee basis but in some cases, indeed, retired civil servants have provided their services without any additional remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2729">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that records of past employments of new recruits are not captured in such a way as to provide a dedicated basis for compiling the information requested by the Deputy.  Accordingly, the specific information requested is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2730">The OPW has a current workforce of over 2,000 which rises by approximately 500 during the summer months.  This workforce is made up of civil servants and State Industrial employees, including seasonal and on-call workers.  The Office does not record the past employment of recruits in such a way as to provide a complete and composite basis for compiling the information requested.  This would require the setting up of separate statistical records through the examination of each individual staff member's file, assuming the staff member provided the information in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">However, I am advised that during 2008 four retired District Inspectors from the OPW were re-employed by the OPW and earned a total of €72,641.82 between them.  Their annual pension entitlements as of 1 September 2008 amount to approximately €57,200 between them.  Both figures provided are made up of different individual amounts.  In relation to other offices under the remit of my Department, the following is the position:</p>

According to Revenue records, the person in question is aged over 65; therefore the €20,000 per annum (€385 per week/€1,667 per month) exemption is applied each pay period.  On that basis no refund can be made during the year.  After the end of the tax year the person can claim a refund of the income levy from the Revenue Commissioners.  He will be due a full refund of the levy provided the combined income (excluding any social welfare payments) is less than €40,000, double the single threshold.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2774">I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 160 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">As the Deputy will be aware Anglo Irish Bank is now a nationalised bank and operating on a commercial basis at arms length from Government.  Certain transactions between Anglo and IL&amp;P that took place last year, prior to nationalisation, have given rise to serious concern and are subject of investigations.  In a press release on Friday 13 February 2009 Anglo indicate the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2776">"Anglo Irish Bank Corporation has had an active counterparty relationship with ILP for a long period of time.  As part of ongoing business activity, this relationship has included placements and receipts of deposits from bank and non-bank affiliates, with transactions categorised as deposits from banks or non-retail customers as appropriate.  Since the onset of the global liquidity crisis, this level of business activity intensified to significant levels and reflected the mutual provision of support by each institution.  Anglo Irish Bank confirms that it sought and received deposits from ILP during 2008, including the last two weeks of September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">Anglo Irish Bank's Annual Report &amp; Accounts explain the following in respect of the Group's balance sheet which totalled €101 billion at 30 September 2008:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2778">1. Loans and advances to banks included short term placements of €7.5 billion with ILP.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2779">2. In the course of its business Anglo Irish Bank receives deposits from non-bank affiliates of banking groups which are shown within non-retail customer funding.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2780">3. Where no set-off arrangements exist between deposits and loans, accounting standards require that such deposits are recorded separately as liabilities in the balance sheet.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2781">4. At 30 September 2008 Anglo Irish Bank had deposits of some €7.3 billion relating to Irish Life Assurance plc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">We wish to clarify that the interbank placements with ILP were not cash collateral for deposits from Irish Life Assurance plc and no set-off arrangements existed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">Anglo Irish Bank confirms that ILP asked for and was provided with interbank deposits throughout 2008 and significant funding through a €3.45bn security repurchase arrangement as at 30 June 2008.  Half of this amount matured on 3 July with the remainder maturing on 4 September.  Anglo Irish Bank was asked for and provided to ILP significant funding through another security repurchase arrangement involving a total of €4.1bn in December 2008.  This arrangement was unwound at their request on 23 December 2008.  At 31 December 2008 Anglo Irish Bank had provided funding totalling €0.9bn to ILP and received funding totalling €0.4bn from ILP.  The Bank confirms that all transactions have been appropriately recorded in its books and records and financial statements and in its daily, weekly and monthly regulatory returns."</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">IL&amp;P in a press release also on 13 February 2009 indicate that in addition to the specific transactions mentioned in the Deputy's question the following inter-bank arrangements were in place.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2785">"Additional Financial Information:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2786">In the interests of clarity, Irish Life &amp; Permanent plc (IL&amp;P) is making disclosure of the nature and extent of the Group's dealings with Anglo Irish Bank (Anglo) across each institution's reporting dates.  We emphasise again that each of these transactions was properly accounted for in the Group's [Irish Life &amp; Permanent plc] books and records and were fully disclosed in our regular reports and returns to the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2787">Deposits lodged with Anglo Irish Bank: On 31 March 2008, at the request of Anglo,IL&amp;P, through its subsidiary Irish Life Assurance (ILA), deposited €750 million overnight on receipt of €1 billion cash into Permanent TSB which was offered as collateral in respect of the deposit.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2788">During September, at the request of Anglo, IL&amp;P, through its subsidiary ILA, deposited a total of €3.45 billion with Anglo in five separate deposits [on dates from 26 September to 29 September] accepting €3.45 billion of cash into Permanent TSB which was offered as collateral in respect of these deposits.  These transactions matured on the 2 and 3 October.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2789">On 29 September, IL&amp;P was contacted by Anglo on three separate occasions requesting further advances which were declined as further collateral was unavailable from Anglo to support such deposits.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2790">On 30 September, following the introduction of the Government Guarantee Scheme, and again at the request of Anglo, IL&amp;P, through its subsidiary ILA, agreed to place a total of €4 billion on deposit overnight with Anglo on receipt of €4 billion into Permanent TSB which was offered as collateral in respect of these deposits.  This transaction occurred in four tranches.  These transactions matured on 1 October.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2791">As part of IL&amp;P's ongoing wholesale funding programme, the bank enters into normal secured interbank transactions of short term duration with a number of participants including the ECB.  In accordance with market norms, these involve the pledging of eligible mortgage assets in exchange for cash with the transactions being accounted for as interbank deposits.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2792">At 30 June 2008 IL&amp;P had outstanding €7.73 billion of such transactions.  Anglo's participation in these transactions amounted to €3.33 billion.  These transactions were correctly accounted for as interbank deposits in the interim accounts of IL&amp;P.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2793">There were no material collateralised transactions with Anglo at 31 December 2008."</p>

            <p eId="para_2801">The position is that an annual exemption from income tax applies for 2009 in respect of those married persons aged 65 years and over whose total income does not exceed €40,000.  This limit can be increased by an additional €575 for the first and second dependent child and €830 for each subsequent dependent child.  I should point out that where a married couple's income rises slightly above the exemption limits they can be taxed under the marginal relief system.  Under this system the exemption limits continue to be applied and the couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit until their level of income is such that it would be more favourable to be taxed under the normal tax system of credits and bands.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2803">A contract for difference (CFD) is a form of derivative instrument that enables an investor to take a position on a share in a company and its likely performance (either a rise or fall in share value) without owning the shares.  A CFD in itself does not attract a stamp duty liability and it was never the case that it did.  A purchaser of a CFD does not buy the shares and therefore he or she is not liable for stamp duty.  The seller of the CFD is exposed to a risk that the price for the share concerned will move.  To hedge this risk, the seller of the CFD purchases the share itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_2804">It is not the case that stamp duty on transactions related to CFDs was abolished in 2006.  Up to that year, financial institutions relied on the application of either market maker or broker/dealer relief to ensure that a stamp duty charge on shares purchased in connection with a CFD did not arise.  In March 2006, Revenue issued a clarification note which stated that, in its view, these reliefs did not apply to shares bought to hedge CFD exposure.  This clarification notice was subsequently withdrawn and the Finance Act 2007 introduced the new intermediary relief, which ensured that the purchase of shares to hedge a CFD would not attract stamp duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">Following the announcement by my predecessor of a review of the law as it relates to stamp duty on share transactions underpinning CFDs and the withdrawal of the Revenue clarification notice, Revenue accepted that, given the likelihood of that business transferring to non-Irish shares, it was unlikely that there would be any real loss of stamp duty arising from allowing market maker relief or broker/dealer relief to be claimed in a CFD-related share purchase.  There is no reason to assume this position changed with the introduction of intermediary relief.  Indeed, the yield from stamp duty on share transfers rose from €406 million in 2006 to €608.7 million in 2007, although it decreased to €419.4 million in the following year, reflecting the overall decline in share transactions in the current global economic downturn.</p>

            <p eId="para_2807">As part of the recapitalisation package announced on 11 February, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland reconfirmed their December commitment to increase lending capacity to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by 10% and to provide an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  If the mortgage lending is not taken up, then the extra capacity will be available to SMEs.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.  Compliance with this commitment will be monitored by the Financial Regulator.  The banks will make quarterly reports, with the first report to end March 2009 to be submitted by end April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">The recapitalised banks have also agreed to engage in a ‘clearing group' chaired by a Government representative and including representation from business interests and State agencies.  The purpose of this group will be to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  There will also be an independent review of credit availability which will be funded by the banks but managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">A Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises was published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February.  This code will apply to all regulated banks and building societies and will facilitate access to credit, promote fairness and transparency and ensure that banks will assist borrowers in meeting their obligations, or otherwise deal with an arrears situation in an orderly and appropriate manner.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform customers of the basis for decisions made and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.  Where a customer gets into difficulty the banks will give the customer reasonable time and seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  This is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810">Furthermore, a €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is being established by each of the recapitalised banks.  A quarterly report to the Financial Regulator of the loans made and the purposes for which they have been made will be required.  The banks have also agreed to each provide €15m to a new seed capital fund with Enterprise Ireland.  The banks funding will be matched as appropriate by funding under Enterprise Ireland's Seed and Venture Capital Programme and/or by funding from other national or international investors.  It is expected that much of these funds will be utilised by SMEs.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_620">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2826">I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 171 to 176, inclusive, 217, 219, 220, 229, 233 and 236 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">The Irish Government formally notified the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in October last that there would be no automatic renewal of the Agreement when the five year term expires on 1 May, 2009.  While Ireland's current agreement is based on Hague principles, there is a need to elaborate the Agreement to reflect the standards of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption more comprehensively.  This is in line with Ireland's own commitment to ratify the Hague Convention.  It is also relevant to reflect the experiences gained by both sides over the first five years of a formal relationship between the two States.  This approach is also part of the preparations for new adoption legislation in which it is proposed that a bilateral agreement will be required between Ireland and any State which has not ratified the Hague Convention.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has not yet ratified the Convention.  Officials travelled to Vietnam in November, 2008 to meet with the relevant authorities dealing with intercountry adoption as well as the embassies of other governments to discuss intercountry adoption in Vietnam and progress towards ratification more generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">In December 2008, following a Government decision on the matter, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities advising that the Government wished to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new bilateral adoption Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement.  In order to expedite the negotiation process, Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations.  The Vietnamese authorities responded positively to Ireland's request to enter into formal negotiations and the proposal that Ireland would prepare a first draft.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">Work on a draft agreement requires careful and detailed consideration by a number of parties including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office and the Adoption Board.  An initial text was prepared by my Office in December and the draft is now at an advanced stage.  It will be finalised shortly once legal advices have been received on outstanding matters.  It is anticipated that this will be forwarded to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration in the immediate future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">The issue of contingency arrangements in the case of an Agreement not being reached by 1 May, 2009 was raised by the Government in a December 2008 communication to the Vietnamese.  The Vietnamese authorities formally advised on proposed contingency arrangements on Friday, 13 February, through the Irish Embassy in Hanoi.  My Office subsequently prepared and circulated a public information note on the contingency plans to prospective adoptive parents through the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency and the adoption support groups.  I want to emphasise that these are contingency plans in the event of an Agreement not being reached by 1 May 2009.  My officials and I are continuing to pursue the successful conclusion of a bilateral agreement with Vietnam as a priority.  The Irish government will continue to seek to re-visit the contingency arrangements which have been put in place over the course of and in light of negotiations on a new agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">I feel obliged to remind the House that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and decisions it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of the adoption of its children must be treated sensitively as appropriate to a sovereign state.  I respectfully suggest that demands for guarantees or changes to contingency arrangements are matters which fall to be dealt with as part of the negotiation process on a bilateral basis.  At this stage, I cannot pre-empt either Government's deliberative process as those negotiations advance.  My priority is to advance the process and avoid debate outside of that process which could potentially jeopardise or interfere with discussions with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">I can assure you that the work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue, and to implement the Government's decisions, has been given, and continues to be given, the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration.  At all times, the Government, and I, and the officials advising us, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_2836">The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) did not provide funding to youth cafés in 2006, 2007, 2008 or to date in 2009.  The OMCYA has been allocated €750,000 from Dormant Accounts for the development of a structured programme of youth cafes in 2009.  Final decisions on the operation of this programme are still under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">The focus of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) which is now under the remit of the OMCYA is not on the provision of youth cafés.  However a number of the facilities built under the YPFSF include a youth café area incorporated within the facility.  The objective of the Fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  The Youth Affairs Section that transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the OMCYA as of 1 January, 2009 has also provided funding in recent years to a small number of youth work projects that provide youth cafe facilities for young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_2841">The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies/initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Applications for funding under the YPFSF are made through the relevant Development Group which determines the suitability of proposals against priorities identified for the area and funding is allocated to relevant projects taking account of this advice amongst other criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">To date, over €150m has been allocated under the Fund of which €66m is capital funding towards approximately 214 projects in existing YPFSF areas.  In 2008 €4.916m capital funding was provided to support 26 capital projects and €18.1m current funding was allocated to support approximately 150 current projects and programmes and the employment of over 408 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2843">Funding from the Youth Affairs budget (€52.6m in 2008) supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for young people.  These are delivered in the main by voluntary youth organisations.  In particular, funding is provided to 31 national or major regional youth organisations through the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  Funding for this Scheme amounted to €13.4m in 2008.  In addition, funding of €20.98m was provided to 182 projects under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme as well as €8.73m for 104 projects under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (Round 1 funding stream mainstreamed to Department of Education and Science in 2004 and 2006).  While funding for these two latter Schemes is channelled mainly through the VECs, the projects are operated by voluntary youth organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2848">At present EU food labelling legislation is harmonised by Council Directive 2000/13/EC, transposed in 2002, with seven amendments since.  In January 2008, the European Commission presented its proposals on updating and harmonising this legislation.  The proposal is still under discussion and it is not expected that the Regulation will be finalised before the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">Currently, country of origin must be displayed on the label for beef and veal.  The draft EU Commission proposal makes allowance for voluntary Country of Origin Labelling for food products.  In addition the Commission has proposed that "where the country of origin or the place of provenance of the food is not the same as the one of its primary ingredient(s), the country of origin or place of provenance of those ingredient(s) shall also be given".  Furthermore, it proposes that "for meat, other than beef and veal, the indication on the country of origin or place of provenance may be given as a single place only where animals have been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.  In other cases information on each of the different places of birth, rearing and slaughter shall be given".</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">In November 2008, Ireland submitted a proposal to the Commission that, for all food products, country of origin labelling should be mandatory.  This issue is currently being discussed at EU Working Group level.  The Department of Health and Children will continue to advocate in support of this proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2886">As the Deputies are aware, the youth sector has received considerable financial support over the past number of years.  Funding expanded from €35.5m in 2004 to €52m in 2008. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector including the roll out of a number of sections of the Youth Work Act, 2001 and actions cited in the National Youth Work Development Plan, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2887">It is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over €48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities. I have met with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), which represents some 50 youth organisations, and am aware of the valuable work carried out by the youth work sector, including its strong volunteer base, both in the particular areas referred to by the Deputies as well as across the country.   I wish to assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to minimise the impact of the reduction in funding available to the youth sector and to preserve and maintain existing provision in so far as is possible.</p>

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 110 of 12 February 2009, if in view of the fact that enhanced subvention is governed by an Act, it is legally justified that the Health Service Executive does not allow hard pressed families in County Roscommon the opportunity to apply for enhanced subvention; the reason enhanced subvention is non-existent in Counties Roscommon and Leitrim while it is available in other areas within the HSE west; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that some families are deprived of this facility; and if she will ensure that this anomaly is dealt with ensuring all elderly persons in need of nursing home care are treated equally regardless of what county they reside in.

         asked the

         if he will ensure that the new Adoption Bill will confer on adoptive parents a wide menu of post-adoptive services, rather than confining these parents to post-adoptive services from the agency or the health board that processes their application to adopt; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2943">Under the new Bill, there is no specific provision to provide post adoption services for children who have additional needs. Adopted children, who have additional needs have, and will continue to have, the same eligibility and entitlements to health, personal social services and special education needs as any child in Ireland. However, the Bill does make statutory provision for the notification by adoptive parents of the adoption on return to Ireland with a child. This notification must be made both to the Adoption Authority for the purposes of registering the child as well as to the HSE, so that the child receives all of the normal child health surveillance services available through the public health system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">As regards information and tracing for adopted persons, again, the Bill does not cover this area as there is already an effective administrative system for dealing with the issue of information and tracing. The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. The National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR) assists adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information, or to state their contact preferences.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">In November 2007, the Adoption Board launched the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Adoption Information and Tracing Service" to set standards and provide guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally.  The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally.  In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, I understand that subject to resources, the Adoption Board intends to undertake a consultation process with interested parties to determine how best to address the information and tracing needs of those who have been adopted from abroad.</p>

As the Deputy will be aware, the youth sector has received considerable financial support over recent years. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of services. It is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over €48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people. I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to minimise the impact of the reduction in funding available to the youth sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Noel Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2954">I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 251 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2955">The Irish Coast Guard of my Department has the role of safeguarding the quality of the marine environment from ship sourced pollution through the provision of an efficient and effective response to marine casualty and pollution incidents from vessels and offshore platforms in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. This includes casualty response to vessels in need of assistance and pollution response arising from the threat of, or actual spillage or loss of oil or hazard and noxious substances (HNS), which threaten the Irish coastline or related interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2956">On 14 February, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) advised the Coast Guard's Marine Rescue Coordination Centre, Dublin that satellite surveillance indicated a possible pollution incident 50 miles South-west of the Fastnet Rock. The Air Corps CASA Aircraft was tasked by the Coast Guard to investigate. Photos from the CASA overflights showed the Russian aircraft carrier ‘Admiral Kuznetsov' at anchor in 90 metres of water, and an oil tanker tendered astern. There was another Russian oil tanker and Russian ocean going tug close by. In the area of the vessels was an oil slick of approximately 22 square miles. A Coast Guard helicopter later confirmed this sighting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2957">The Russian Authorities confirmed on 16th February that the carrier had been carrying out a fuel transfer operation from a Russian supply tanker at sea. An internal Russian investigation is being carried out into the cause of the incident. The Coast Guard requested regular aerial surveillance flights from the UK Coastguard, using various specialist sensors onboard their aircraft.  It was estimated that, the spill was between 700 and 1100 tonnes of fuel oil spreading out in distinct slicks. Estimates of oil spilt on water are highly difficult to estimate, as slick thickness can be variable over the length of the slick and, in the absence of data from a polluter, is difficult to accurately gauge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">LE Aisling, and HMS Gloucester took samples of the oil from the scene for testing by a specialist laboratory in Scotland. Results are awaited. LE Aoife also took samples for analysis. The Russian Embassy is supplying samples of the oils carried onboard the Russian tankers and the aircraft carrier and the material data sheet for the oil. The Coast Guard continue to daily monitor the slick with its own Helicopters and Air Corps Casa.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">The Coast Guard contracted an Irish Shannon-based tug MV Celtic Isle which utilised skimmers and other oil recovery equipment with limited success due to the dispersed nature of the spill and weather conditions.  The Coast Guard engaged, but later stood down, the EMSA recovery vessel, as their estimate of the situation supported by international advice concluded that its use would not be productive.   Pollution recovery equipment has been readied at Coast Guard stores to be deployed at sea and on the southeast coastline if needed in coordination with local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">Coast Guard computer modelling of the spill show that some more of the oil is expected to evaporate or dissolve into the water column. The residual oil remaining may develop into tar balls and may end up on the Irish South east coast.  The Coast Guard convened an inter-Governmental Group to monitor and advise on the situation and potential impact to the coastline and marine environment. Local authorities would recover any oil coming ashore on the coast mechanically with assistance from the Coast Guard who will direct the shore response.  A Russian delegation sought to meet with the Coast Guard and this was arranged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">I am satisfied with the action taken to date.  The incident highlights the constant need for preparedness, prevention and response to maritime incidents.  I also want to acknowledge the national and international cooperation which assisted in dealing with this incident to date.  As I have stated, the Coast Guard was able to call on many state agencies in co-ordinating an effective response.  Furthermore, the nature of the response and degree of support from UK agencies was much appreciated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">I want to place on the record my particular appreciation and recognition of the part EMSA plays in this area and their specific role in this case.  Follow up action, including potential cost recovery, is still under consideration at this time.</p>

Under the same legislation there is a duty on the master of a ship concerned, involved or observing an oil pollution incident or the likelihood of an incident in excess of a certain minimum level to report the incident to the authorities.  The requirements of the Sea Pollution Act, 1991 do not apply to any warship or to any ship for the time being used by the government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.</p>

While the use of existing road infrastructure will be considered in the context of delivering a comprehensive and safe network, it is too early, at this stage, to take a definitive position on the N3 or, indeed, any individual stretch of road.</p>

            <p eId="para_3078">As regards implementation of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, the position is that section 9, which provides for the structural separation of alcohol products from other beverages and food products in mixed trading premises, and the test-purchasing provisions of section 14 have not yet been commenced.  As the Deputy is aware, during discussions leading up to enactment of the 2008 Act, I gave an undertaking that if the objectives of structural separation could be achieved by means of adherence to a voluntary Code of Practice by the mixed trading sector, I would be prepared to defer implementation of section 9. I stipulated however that implementation of any such Code would be subject to an independent audit and verification process and that if such oversight indicated that the objectives of structural separation were not being achieved, I would have no hesitation in commencing section 9.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">I am pleased to say that the Code of Practice and the accompanying oversight arrangements have now been agreed between organisations representing the mixed trading sector and both my Department and the Department of Health and Children. These details will be announced in the near future and I expect to receive the first report on implementation of the Code in September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">Section 14 of the 2008 Act inserted new provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 to permit test purchasing of alcohol by persons who are over 15 but under 18 years of age under the control of the Garda Síochána. The section provides for the issuing of guidelines on the procedures to be followed in test purchasing operations following consultation with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Health and Children. A Working Group, comprising representatives of my Department, An Garda Síochána and the Department of Health and Children, has been established to draw up these guidelines and I look forward to receiving their proposals in due course. Training requirements for the implementation of test purchasing are also being assessed at present.</p>

I am informed that the gathering of the specific information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, I can advise the Deputy that persons held in custody for these reasons comprise a tiny fraction of the overall prisoner population.  To illustrate this point, figures relating to 20 February, 2009  indicate that there was only 1 person in custody for non-payment of fines in relation to not having a television licence.</p>

Local Garda management is aware of incidents of anti-social behaviour in the area, which are of particular concern to local residents and the business community in the area.  Regular meetings to discuss matters of mutual concern, including issues relating to public disorder and anti-social behaviour, are held between local Garda management and personnel of service providers in the area.  Any issues raised at these meetings are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3145">All members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing criminal legislation, including those relating to public disorder and anti-social behaviour. The area is the subject of regular on-going patrols by members of the local Community Policing Unit and other personnel in the Division.  Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of residents and businesses.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3166">While the number of murders committed involving knives showed a welcome decrease last year from 37 to 15, the overall number of crimes committed using knives is a matter of concern.  On 5 February, the Garda Commissioner and I launched a Knife Awareness Campaign by An Garda Síochána with the objective of informing and educating young people on the dangers of carrying knives and with the aim of reducing the number of incidents of knife crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_3167">It is planned that the campaign will include meetings in schools and community centres around the country featuring local sports stars and role models for young people.  One meeting was held last December as a pilot project in The Base, Ballyfermot.  The location of the remaining meetings will be decided in the light of information on the areas that show higher than average levels of knife crime.  The roll out of meetings will be supported by print and broadcast media initiatives that will be designed to be specific to the locality of the meeting.  Further meetings will be carried out by Community Gardaí around the country who will be equipped with resources, with the aim of maximising the reach of the campaign through school visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3168">The campaign will be supported online by a dedicated website www.howbigdoyoufeel.ie and a presence on social networking websites such as Bebo, Facebook and Twitter, as well as uploaded videos and a viral video.  This will help deliver the campaign message through media that its target audience find accessible and feel comfortable with.  Information leaflets on the campaign will also be made available to young people and their parents.  The campaign is also due to feed into other programmes which support youth workers on youth diversion projects, thereby enabling the campaign message to reach at-risk young people.  It is expected that the cost of the campaign will be approximately €200,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_3170">The marketing and sale of spirit-based alcoholic drinks supplied in lightweight plastic containers, and the possibility of restricting the circulation of such products, continues to be the subject of review by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.  While it is not clear that such products are actively marketed with young people in mind, the fact that the containers are light, portable and easy to conceal means that they could be attractive to persons under the age of 18.  The problem arose in 2004 in relation to vodka sachets (known as "Bullseye Baggies") which had been placed on the market and which appeared to be directed at young people.  On that occasion, my Department sought and obtained the cooperation and agreement of the licensed trade — both the on-trade and off-trade — not to market the product and this strategy proved effective and successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_3171">The experience is that where any such product is already in free circulation within the EU internal market, difficulties arise in prohibiting or restricting its circulation and consumption within a single country.  In the event of the problem re-emerging, my intention would be to again ask both the drinks industry and the licensed trade for their support and cooperation in refusing to market and supply the product.  I am pleased to say that there is now a high level of awareness of the extent of alcohol-related harm in our society and anything that is likely to exacerbate or add to existing problems should be avoided.</p>

A Divisional Crime Manager has also been appointed to assist in the monitoring and analysing of crime trends.  Additional civilian support staff have also been assigned to the Garda Districts concerned, releasing members of An Garda Síochána for patrolling and other duties within the Districts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">Given the geographical location of these Garda Districts there are significant levels of ongoing cross border cooperation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Border Superintendents attend bi-monthly crime meetings in Enniskillen and at Garda Headquarters.  At local level, cross-border crime meetings are held on a monthly basis with regular, sometimes daily, interactions regarding individual incidents and other criminal activity.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account and the situation in the Inishowen peninsula will be kept under review.</p>

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of local policing fora (LPF) by joint policing committees.  Work by a drafting group chaired by my Department is almost complete on a set of guidelines for the LPFs.

            <p eId="para_3219">The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States and their welfare, like the welfare of all Irish citizens abroad, is a key priority for my Department.  I am aware that concerns have been expressed concerning the length of detention of Irish citizens in the United States, prior to their deportation.  While the official figures available to us indicate that the numbers of undocumented Irish being detained and deported have not increased significantly in recent years (see table), I can understand that the anxiety and stress which detention and deportation cause is very real.</p>
            <p eId="para_3220">Our Embassy and the Consulates in the United States provide consular assistance to Irish nationals who have been detained and who are awaiting deportation.  Officials liaise closely with the relevant authorities in the U.S. and, where requested, with the detainee's family in Ireland, throughout the deportation process.  The Embassy and Consulates seek to minimise the detention period, including by assuring US authorities that formal documentation can be provided without delay to enable departure.  They have also, over the years, assisted in expediting the deportation process where there have been particular medical or other humanitarian issues.  Our Ambassador in Washington has raised with the US authorities the issue of the detention and deportation of Irish citizens and requested that their particular circumstances be taken into account.  In addition, through the Emigrant Support Programme, the Government provides funding to a number of organisations who work with the undocumented Irish in the United States, including those who have been detained and who are awaiting deportation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3330">The primary responsibility for the administration of a pension scheme rests with the trustees of the scheme. The trustees must, at all times, act in the best interests of the members and are required under the Pensions Act, and subject to regulations, to provide for the proper investment of the resources and for compliance with the funding standard requirements in the case of defined benefits schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3331">The recent and rapid downturn in the world economy has changed the economic landscape and has had a significant worldwide impact on the performance of pension funds. The indications are that Irish pension funds have lost in excess of 30% of their value in the last 12 months. While it is expected that the number of defined benefit schemes failing the funding standard will increase sharply as a result of current market conditions, the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board as required under the Pensions Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3332">This unprecedented situation has raised new challenges for employers and trustees of both defined benefits and defined contribution schemes. There are no easy answers to these problems but the Government has recently put in place the following short term measures to ease the funding standard requirements on pension schemes:</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">granting additional time for the preparation of funding proposals, as a temporary measure;</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">dealing as flexibly as possible with applications for approval of funding plans;</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">allowing longer periods for recovery plans in appropriate circumstances;</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">allowing the term of a replacement recovery plan to extend beyond the end date of the original plan;</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">taking into account voluntary employer guarantees in approving recovery plans;</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">rejecting recovery plans which fail to demonstrate an appropriate investment approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">Defined Contribution (DC) schemes are relatively immature and for many people there will be adequate time to recoup some or all of the losses which have occurred. There are particular concerns for those who may be at, or close to, retirement and who are required to purchase an annuity on retirement. While good practice would suggest a conservative approach to investments in the last number of years, in the current environment, these scheme members could realise a significant loss in the value of their pension fund. In the circumstances, the Minister for Finance recently announced measures to allow such scheme members a period of up to two years to purchase an annuity. There is, of course, the risk that those availing of the deferment option could sustain further losses and this has been clearly outlined in guidance notes issued by the Pensions Board.  As indicated, these are short-term measures. Further measures designed to protect the interest of the consumer will be reflected in the national framework on pensions which the Government plans to launch shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3343">Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur. Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different types of eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State. The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels and in landlord income. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.  The legal basis for the setting of rent limits is provided for under Article 9(2)(i)(iii) of Statutory Instrument 412 of 2007. Article 9(3) of these regulations provides that a rent supplement shall not payable where the amount of rent exceeds the appropriate maximum amount of rent, as determined in the regulations, having regard to family circumstances and the location of the residence of the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">Notwithstanding these limits, the Health Service Executive has the discretion to award rent supplement above or below the prescribed rent limits, having regard to local rent levels or to meet the particular needs of an individual. Guidelines provide for the payment of rent supplement where the rent is above the statutory rent limit, in the following circumstances:</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,</p>
            <p eId="para_3347">Where the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard and has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of Rent Supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3348">where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3349">Where rent is paid in excess of the statutory limits, the post-rent income of the rent supplement recipient must not be less than the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to that person's family circumstances, less the minimum contribution of €18 a week towards the rent payment.  These discretionary powers available to the Health Service Executive ensure that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the rent supplement scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</p>

The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs. The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly by the Department to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who are running their own school meals projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3352">Under the School Meals Local Projects scheme, the Department funds schools and school-based community organisations in respect of food costs only, subject to various conditions.  Funding is issued on the basis of a rate per child, per meal, per day. It is the responsibility of the school or project to ensure that food is purchased only for children in attendance. All schools or projects have to submit financial returns to the Department which detail the numbers and types of meals provided and the numbers of children benefiting. These returns are backed up by receipts for food costs incurred. School principals making returns have to certify the number of meals provided and the number of pupils benefiting. This is to ensure that all funding is used for the purpose for which it is intended and that no wastage occurs.

The facilitator programme is designed as a targeted approach involving active case management and the development of an individualised progression plan. Under the National Development Plan (NDP) the Department has expanded its facilitator network.  A facilitator service is available to its customers at local offices.

A range of disregards apply depending on the source of the cash income. Where the spouse or partner of a claimant has earnings from employment, social insurance contributions, the health contribution, superannuation/PRSA contributions and trade union subscriptions are disregarded. €20 per day worked is then disregarded (up to a maximum of €60 per week) and 60% of the balance is assessed. The same arrangements apply when the claimant is in employment. Where a claimant or his or her spouse or partner is in receipt of cash income from another source, social insurance contributions, the health contribution and PRSA contributions are disregarded as well as any expenses incurred in relation to any form of self-employment.</p>

In the case of income tax assessable under Schedule E, a one-earner married couple with no children are not liable for income tax where earnings are below €27,450 per annum (€31,950 in the case of a one-earner married couple with children and €36,600 in the case of a two earner married couple). The income levy only applies where individual annual income is in excess of €18,304 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">Where a claimant for jobseeker's allowance is aged under 25 years of age, the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of residing with a parent or step-parent is assessed as means. This is calculated as a percentage of the net disposable income (including social welfare payments other than child benefit, fuel allowances and guardian's payments) available to the household after a range of deductions. Deductions are allowed for income tax, the income levy, PRSI, superannuation/ PRSA contributions, private health insurance contribution, trade union subscriptions as well as rent or mortgage payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3361">When the net income is calculated, a disregard of €600 per week for a two parent family and €470 per week for a one parent family is applied. An additional disregard of €30 applies for all children up to 18 years of age who are not getting a welfare or HSE payment in their own right and for all children over 18 years in full time education irrespective of their age. 34% of the balance is assessed as the weekly value of the benefit and privilege enjoyed by the claimant.  The means testing arrangements relating to the assessment of benefit and privilege are therefore fundamentally different then those applying in the case of jobseeker's allowance. This reflects the fact that the purpose of the assessments differs.  Any changes to the current arrangements for jobseeker's allowance would have to be considered in a Budgetary context including the availability of resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3363">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3364">However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">There are also a number of other ways in which pension entitlements can be protected. People who qualify for payments such as carer's allowance or carer's benefit may, subject to conditions, qualify for credited contributions for the period during which they receive the payment.  In addition, over the last 10 years, the Government has taken a number of measures to make qualification for contributory pension easier. These include a reduction in the yearly contribution rate required for a minimum pension from 20 to 10, and the introduction of special measures such as the pre-53 pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_3366">The Green Paper on pensions considered a number of issues related to the qualifying conditions for a social welfare contributory pension. A framework for future pensions policy is being developed and the issue of contribution conditions will be further addressed in that context. It is expected that the framework will be finalised shortly.  As the person concerned will not reach pension age for several years, it is not possible to say whether she would qualify for a pension at that stage as her entitlement will be assessed under the qualifying conditions pertaining at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3368">From 5 January 2009, in order to be entitled to receive Irish jobseekers benefit, a customer will require a minimum of 104 social insurance contributions paid since entry into insurance. In addition, they must have at least 39 contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year, and at least 13 of these contributions must be paid contributions. For a person applying for Jobseekers Benefit in 2009, the relevant tax year is 2007.  The person referred to in the previous parliamentary question does not meet the qualifying conditions for Irish Jobseekers Benefit under national law as they did not have at least 39 paid or credited contributions in Ireland in the relevant tax year. This is because they were employed in the UK at this time, and paying social insurance contributions there.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">Because the person concerned was last insurably employed in the UK, and does not have any entitlement at present under Irish domestic legislation, the UK authorities are, under EU Regulations, the competent authority for the payment of Jobseekers Benefit. The person's entitlement to UK Jobseekers Benefit can be decided under UK domestic legislation or under EU Regulations. The latter allows for the aggregation of their Irish and UK contributions to assist in meeting the qualifying conditions. Any application for unemployment benefits should therefore be made to the UK authorities. This can be facilitated either by direct contact with the UK authorities, or through one of my Departments Local Offices. Once a person qualifies for UK Jobseekers Benefit they can arrange under EU Regulations to have the entitlement exported to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72. The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  As a Member State of the European Union, we are bound to apply the Regulations governing social security rights of people living and working in the EU, in accordance with the objective of the EC Treaty of the free movement of persons. The rules exist to provide clarity as to which state is competent to pay social security benefits, and also to provide an equitable sharing of costs amongst states.</p>

            <p eId="para_3398">Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors. All workers, both employed and self-employed, are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income.  The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3399">Self-employed persons aged between 16 and 66 years are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.  These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes.  PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments: the Widow's or Widower's (Contributory) Pension; the Guardian's Payment (Contributory); the State Pension (Contributory); Maternity Benefit; Adoptive Benefit, and the Bereavement Grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments, and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">Self-employed people can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In this context, it may be noted that entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance for a self-employed person is primarily based on means, as opposed to the number of days being worked.</p>
            <p eId="para_3402">Their means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.  While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</p>

            <p eId="para_3405">I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 and 341 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">At its last meeting, the Board of Coiste An Asgard had a full discussion on the possibility of salvaging the Asgard II.  The unanimous view of the Board was that a salvage operation should not be pursued any further.  Having carefully considered the Board's report to me, I have accepted its recommendation.  Spending in the region of €2 million on a salvage effort, the outcome of which is uncertain, is a risk that we cannot afford at this time.  A real risk exists whereby more than €2 million could be expended on a salvage effort that proves unsuccessful or, following which, the vessel is found to be damaged beyond repair.  The fact is, that until the vessel is salvaged, it would not be possible to assess whether it can be restored and the cost of doing so.  Clearly, the greater the damage, the higher the cost of restoration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">The Asgard II is a 30-year-old wooden vessel that would have faced ever-increasing maintenance costs in the years ahead.  The Board was of the view that vessels that even after a full restoration the vessel might have on-going maintenance problems.  In addition, the possibility of increased regulatory requirements by the Department of Transport could add substantially to the cost of restoration.  The Board also took into account the view that parents of potential trainees may be reluctant to allow their children to sail on a vessel that has sunk.</p>
            <p eId="para_3408">While the name "Asgard" has been associated with two important vessels, it is also about sail training and introducing young people to the experience of sailing.  My priority is to ensure the continuation of the sail-training scheme.  I have accepted the Board's recommendation to initiate planning for the procurement of a new vessel that will be similar in design to Asgard II but with a steel hull (a steel hulled vessel would be less expensive to build and maintain than a wooden hulled vessel).  I would also hope that the future Asgard III would have facilities to cater for persons with physical disabilities, something the Asgard II could not.</p>
            <p eId="para_3409">I know that it was a very difficult conclusion for the Board to reach, but it is one I accept as being right and sensible.  The costs and risks involved in attempting to salvage and restore Asgard II are too great.  There is no doubt Asgard II was an outstanding sail-training vessel and was held in the highest regard both at home and abroad.  She was an excellent ambassador for this country for close on 30 years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3450">The report of the Expert Group on Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by electric appliances in the home and from electricity pylons. It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields, and is available for download on the Department's website (www.environ.ie).</p>
            <p eId="para_3451">With regard to Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields emitted by electricity power lines, the Report concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects. The Expert Group have recommended that precautionary measures be used, where appropriate, and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Union.  Further information on the World Health Organisation views can be found on their website www.who.int.</p>

            <p eId="para_3466">In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority.  It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.  In working to compile the Register for 2007/08, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades.  On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years.  The task for local authorities, in relation to the Register for 2009/10, was to maintain and build on the progress made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3467">Local authorities were required to publish the Draft Register for 2009/10 on 1 November 2008 and people had until 25 November to check it to ensure that their details are accurately entered on the Register.  My Department ran an advertising campaign to encourage people to check that they are on the Draft Register and to notify their city or county council of any errors or omissions no later than 25 November.  Authorities were required to publish the Final Register for 2009/10 by 1 February 2009 and this is now available for checking.  Individuals not on the Register can avail of the supplement to the Register up until 15 days before the next polling day i.e. Monday 18 May in the case of the Local and European elections being held on 5 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3468">Looking to the future, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.  The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.  My Department appointed consultants to carry out preliminary research on issues arising in relation to establishment of the Electoral Commission.  I published the relevant report for consultation on 10 February 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3472">The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 — 2008, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating (BER) system.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, has been designated as the Issuing Authority with responsibility for the ongoing administration of the BER Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3473">The Regulations require that any person who offers a building for sale or letting on or from 1 January, 2009 or any agent acting on their behalf, is required to produce a copy of the BER certificate to any person expressing an interest in purchasing or taking a letting in the building.  A person who contravenes these requirements commits an offence, unless the building in question is specifically exempted under Article 3 of the Regulations, and is liable, on prosecution by the Building Control Authority in whose functional area the building is situated, to a fine not exceeding €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3474">The Private Residential Tenancies Board and Fáilte Ireland have no formal role in ensuring that the private rental sector and the holiday accommodation rental sector respectively comply with the Regulations.  Notwithstanding this both bodies are aware of the Regulations and have indicated that they will take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the requirement for BER certificates within their respective sectors.  My Department will also continue to work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, SEI and the 37 local Building Control Authorities to promote awareness of the obligations which arise under the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3475">I understand that under-floor heating and thermostats on water and heating systems are recognised by the calculations methodology, known as the Dwellings Environmental Assessment Procedure or DEAP, which underpins the Building Energy Rating System.  Detailed advice in relation to the operation of this software can be obtained from SEI.</p>

            <p eId="para_3480">Under the National Central Heating Programme 2004-2008 the Department has co-funded the installation of central heating, and associated insulation and energy efficiency improvements, in some 26,000 local authority dwellings at a cost to the Exchequer of €125 million.  A further €12 million has been allocated in 2009 to complete the programme, with local authorities overseeing the installation of some 2,100 units commenced in 2008.  Local authorities also have delegated sanction for the use of their internal capital receipts, subject to approval by my Department of an annual improvement works programme, and may direct resources to projects which are deemed most meritorious of funding in their authority.  Works funded under this programme may include the installation of insulation and other measures to improve energy efficiency in their stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">As part of a national programme for the "greening" of the social housing stock, some €50 million in exchequer funding has been set aside in 2009 to support a range of initiatives to improve the energy efficiency of the stock.  This programme will include support for the first round of Towards Carbon Neutral and insulation retrofitting projects, as well as providing funding to assist local authorities in improving the energy rating of its dwellings, due to be re-let during the year, and to advance the overall energy efficiency in apartment complexes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3491">Section 5 of the 2007 Act contains a new provision for the submission of a 7 Day Notice to a Building Control Authority, before grant of the relevant FSC, where a person intends to commence work on the construction of a building, or an extension of, or a material alteration to, a building. It must be accompanied by a valid application for an FSC and by a Statutory Declaration stating that the application for the relevant FSC has been completed in all respects and complies with the requirements of the Building Regulations; that any works commenced before the FSC is granted will comply with the Regulations; and that the person will carry out any modifications which may be required by the FSC, when granted, within such period as may be specified by the Building Control Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3492">There is also a new provision for a Revised Fire Safety Certificate where an application for an FSC is made before grant of planning permission for the works, if required by the subsequent permission, or where significant revision has been made to the design or works of a building for which an FSC has been granted.  In addition, there is provision for a Regularisation Certificate where a building has been commenced or completed without an application for an FSC, where such Certificate is required. An application for such Certificate must include a Statutory Declaration from the applicant that the works carried out are in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations. The Building Control Authority is empowered to specify that the Regularisation Certificate will not have effect unless any conditions /additional works required by the Authority are carried out within a period of 4 months after it is granted.  I intend to introduce the necessary Regulations to give effect to the provisions of Section 5 of the 2007 Act, which will include relevant fees in respect of these provisions, at an early date.</p>

            <p eId="para_3498">The key regulations governing the standards of private rented accommodation are the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008. These regulations specify minimum requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, absence of damp and rot, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply; they do not refer to overcrowding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3499">The issue of overcrowded houses is dealt with in Part IV of the Housing Act 1966. Under that Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act. The housing authority may serve notice on the owner of a house specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy a house without causing overcrowding and where the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, may require the owner to desist from causing or permitting such overcrowding within a period not exceeding twenty one days.

            <p eId="para_3509">In the context of the introduction of the licensing system provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, the facility in question applied to the EPA for, and was granted, an Integrated Pollution Control Licence.  Such licences encompass the full range of environmental impact of an activity, including the management of waste arising as a result of the activity.  However, the company went into liquidation before the conditions in the licence could be met and the liquidator could apply to the High Court to disclaim the IPC licence.  The judgment, on 29 July 2004, found as a matter of fact that the IPC licence was granted after the company had ceased production of steel and that the conditions of the licence could not be applied retrospectively.  A lacuna thus arose as regards the regulatory status of the facility.  The resolution of this lacuna must involve a determination of the future use of the site and the appropriate regulatory arrangements that should apply to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">My Department has continued to exercise responsibility for the care and maintenance of the site, the ownership of which is vested in the Minister for Finance.  Cork County Council acts as the Department's agent in that regard.  Elements of site clearance have been necessary to avoid negative environmental impacts and for health and safety reasons.  It has also involved an extensive site investigation to determine the extent of environmental damage and to guide further Government consideration of the future development and use of the site.  These activities have been carried out in close consultation with the EPA and Cork County Council, which are the appropriate environmental regulatory authorities.  I will bring proposals to the Government on the future utilisation of the site soon.  The resulting decision will indicate the further regulatory requirements which may need to be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_3518">Along with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I launched the National Insulation Programme for economic recovery on 8 February.  The programme entails a three pronged approach to addressing the legacy of older housing with poor energy efficiency standards.  In so far as schemes in the programme under the aegis of my Department are concerned, the home energy saving scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of €50 million for 2009.  Some €20 million has been allocated to the warmer homes scheme — Exchequer funding of €15 million from my Department's Vote and a further €5 million between ESB and Bord Gáis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">Improving the energy efficiency of local authority housing is a key objective for the Government.  To that end, a €50 million fund has been set aside in 2009 to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive energy efficiency programme.  The programme will include a number of elements including support for the first round of towards carbon neutral and insulation retrofitting projects.  In addition, funding will be used to help local authorities to improve the energy rating of dwellings due to be re-let during the year and to advance the overall energy efficiency in apartment complexes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">Investment in the programme in 2010 and subsequent years will be a matter for the Government to determine in the context of the annual Estimates process and decisions on the capital programme.  The estimate provided for job creation arising from the national insulation programme for economic recovery arises from assessments of the impacts of the home energy saving pilot programme run in 2008 and other ongoing similar programmes, including the warmer homes scheme.  The estimates employ Irish and international metrics for job creation according to the market activity stimulated by support funds.  They do not include tertiary benefits to the economy, nor are they "net" of jobs lost in certain industries, such as the construction industry.  They are calculated by extrapolating from data collected in the 2008 HES pilot by assuming the multiplier effect — the amount of private capital in addition to Government spending — and considering how much of that goes into labour costs, an assumption about wages, the amount of associated building energy rating assessors and the amount of indirect job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3538">Significant time, expertise, human and financial resources have been invested to ensure the optimum outcome and best possible broadband service from the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) procurement process.  In the initial stages of the competitive dialogue procurement process, which, by its nature, is not of a defined duration, anticipated timelines for contract award were indicated, including December 2007 and June 2008.  A judicial review challenge, which impacted on the proposed timelines, was commenced in spring 2008 and concluded in July 2008.  My Department successfully concluded the evaluation process and the award of the NBS contract to Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd  within four months of issuing the final ITT documentation on 25 August 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3539">I am satisfied that the well designed and thorough procurement process was undertaken by my Department within the shortest possible timeframe, that it has resulted in the appointment of a service provider who will make available quality, affordable broadband to all premises in the NBS area and that the cost of doing so represents good value for public money.  No overrun costs have been incurred by my Department and the amount of the Exchequer contribution to 3 is capped at €79.8m for the duration of the contract, thereby representing some 36% of the total investment cost.  The NBS project is also eligible for EU co-funding under the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_3540">The initial scoping exercise for the Scheme involved broad consultation with representative service providers across all platforms (mobile, wireless and fixed operators).  Similar broadband schemes were examined (Northern Ireland, Scotland, UK regions). Meetings were held with Regional Authorities, Departmental counterparts in Northern Ireland, European Commission officials and industry representative bodies.  No specific open forum consultation event was held.</p>

            <p eId="para_3542">Under Phase ll of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme a total of 88 networks covering 94 towns were approved.  It had been envisaged that the networks would be completed by the end of 2007.  However, the design stage was extended in order to provide for a level of engagement with local authorities aimed at minimising the need for subsequent design changes.  Twenty-nine networks were completed in 2007 with a further 29 networks completed in 2008.  A further 2 networks are currently under construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3543">In December 2007 I suspended the construction of the remaining 28 networks covering 29 towns pending the outcome of the Value for Money and Policy review of Phase l of the MANs Programme and other analyses, including the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks.  Approximately €98 million has been spent to date on Phase ll MANS.  This amount includes Local Authority contribution of approximately €9 million, all construction costs, design and associated programme management costs.  All networks were constructed under a fixed price contract.  Apart from the detailed engagement with local authorities, my Department has not engaged in any consultations on the MAN Programme specifically.</p>
            <p eId="para_3544">The engagement of an MSE 2 is the subject of a procurement process and is currently in the contract negotiation phase with the preferred bidder e/Net. While the decision to suspend the construction of 28 of the Phase II MANs did give rise to a delay in the procurement process, I expect this process to conclude by the end of March.  It is crucial that the procurement process yields maximum value for money.  Accordingly, the process cannot be rushed and will only be concluded when such value is secured.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3550">I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 381 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3551">The report on the review of the security of Ireland's access to commercial oil supplies was commissioned by my Department on foot of a commitment in the Government White Paper "Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland — the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020".  Given that Ireland is 100% dependent on imports for its oil requirements and that oil represents approximately 56% of our total energy needs, it was considered crucial that this analysis was undertaken to identify any weaknesses in Ireland's position with regard to securing adequate supplies of oil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3552">The report was carried out on behalf of my Department by international oil consultants, Purvin and Gertz, and Irish energy consultants, Byrne and O'Cleirigh, at a cost of €271, 754 (inclusive of VAT).  The report found that in normal circumstances, there is no significant risk to Ireland in terms of availability of commercial oil, or the capability of Ireland's oil industry to procure oil.  The report noted that the principal risk to commercial oil supply arises from some weaknesses in the infrastructure links for importing, storing and distributing oil supplies.  The three principal ports for importing large oil cargoes are Dublin, Whitegate and Shannon Foynes, with Dublin accounting for 45% of Ireland's oil imports.  Other ports are used for smaller shipments and transhipment from the larger ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3553">In light of Ireland's key dependency on Dublin Port, the consultants recommended that any redevelopment of Dublin Port should recognise the importance of maintaining adequate capacity for commercial oil importation and storage.  The consultants also suggested that options for accommodating larger ships at Dublin, Whitegate and Shannon should be considered.  The report has been furnished to the Department of Transport and to Indecon consultants, who are currently undertaking a study of the role of Dublin Port on behalf of the Department of Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3554">The report also recommends investigation and consultation on a range of large-scale, long-term proposals, including the development of a commercial distribution and strategic oil facility outside of Dublin, with pipeline connection to Dublin Port and a possible pipeline from the refinery at Whitegate to the new facility.  These proposals will be examined very carefully, in consultation with stakeholders, particularly the oil industry.  The report recognised that the pipeline proposal would not necessarily be justified from either a commercial or security of supply perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_3555">The consultants also recommended that the Government undertakes a broad analysis of the future for the refining operation at Whitegate.  Approximately 25% of Ireland's oil products are refined in Whitegate.  Under the 2001 Sale and Purchase Agreement for the Whitegate and Bantry facilities between Government and the owners of these facilities, the owners have legal obligations to operate these facilities until 2016.  My Department will be engaging with the owners of the refinery, the oil industry, and stakeholders generally, with a view to considering options for the future of these facilities beyond 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_3556">While the report found that there is currently no significant risk to supplies of oil, or the ability of the oil industry to import oil for onward distribution, in normal circumstances, it pointed to measures that would minimise the effects of any major disruption to oil supplies, such as a blockage at Dublin Port.  In particular, the report suggests that the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA)should increase the level of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, so that adequate stocks would be available to deal with any disruptions to port infrastructure.  The Government's Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020 already commits to the rebalancing of strategic oil stocks in favour of wholly owned stocks on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  NORA has recently placed a notice in the Official Journal of the EU seeking expressions of interest by consultants to manage a tender process for the procurement of additional storage on the island.  The findings of this P&amp;G report will critically inform this process and the report will be provided to tenderers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3557">As regards the position with the oil reserves generally, Ireland is fully compliant with its obligations to maintain 90 days' of strategic oil stocks exclusively for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.  Ireland holds its strategic stocks through a combination of stocks held by industry, and stocks held in Ireland and abroad by NORA.  In planning for any possible disruptions, my Department is also examining the links between oil and gas disruption, and is coordinating planning so that the necessary supplies of oil to cater for fuel-switching in the event of a gas disruption can be catered for.  This would be particularly important for electricity generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3564">The Home Energy Saving Scheme which I launched on 8 February last, provides grant assistance to homeowners for attic and wall insulation, efficient boilers and heating controls.  These measures were selected for inclusion in the scheme, with the assistance of SEI, which has built up a considerable expertise on residential energy efficiency matters as part of their statutory remit and in the course of their oversight of the pilot phase of the scheme in 2008.  SEI recommended these measures as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at the least cost.  Insulation of windows and doors is not eligible for grant assistance under the scheme. My Department and SEI will however be keeping the scheme under review including the scope for adding other measures to the Scheme subject to budgetary and technical considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3565">The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners and landlords will be able to apply under the scheme from next month.  In the meantime, homeowners can register their interest with SEI on 1850 927000 or at <i>hes@sei.ie</i> Homeowners may arrange to have a building energy rating carried out immediately, if they wish, but this is not a requirement for participation in the scheme.  However, homeowners should not undertake any remedial work until they have received grant approval from SEI.  Accordingly work underway or recently completed will not be eligible for grant assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_3569">Licence duties for commercial salmon fishing are set by the Minister, on foot of an Order, the most recent being the Fisheries (Commercial Fishing Licences) (Alteration of Duties and Fees) Order 2007 (SI. No. 812 of 2007), approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  These fees are uniform across all fisheries regions and are currently reviewed on an annual basis.  There was no change in duties between 1988 and 2004, when increases were applied to account for movement in the Consumer Price Index in the intervening years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3570">In 2007, following cessation of mixed stock fisheries at sea and as part of a suite of conservation measures for the management of the wild salmon fishery, a salmon conservation component was applied to all commercial and recreational licences, the holders of which continue to harvest salmon.  This component represents 50% of the licence fee collected.  The income generated from this component is reinvested by the Fisheries Boards in the rehabilitation of wild salmon habitat and stocks throughout the country.  For 2009 I decided not to increase the fees for any salmon fishing licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3571">I am advised that certain waters around the country are designated as special tidal waters and draft net users are required to obtain a Special Draft Net Licence to fish these waters.  Under the Rivers Owenmore and Owenduff (Tidal Waters) Order 1967 (SI No. 33 of 1967), the tidal waters of Owenmore and Owenduff are so designated and attract the licence fee referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3618">The objective of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is to provide access to affordable, scaleable broadband services to rural areas, many of which do not currently have any broadband service. The NBS will be rolled out on an electoral division (ED) basis and will address EDs that are without adequate broadband services.  The following tables show the EDs in County Laois, which will be covered under the NBS and those which will not.</p>
            <p eId="para_3619">In designing the NBS scheme, which was approved by the EU Commission, my Department needed to strike a balance between reaching as many unserved areas  as possible and minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas, thereby minimising market distortion in accordance with EU State Aid rules.  Where an ED is completely unserved or partially covered by any broadband service provider it is included in the NBS.  EDs that are substantially covered by an existing broadband service provider are deemed to be served and thereby excluded.  Details of the availability of broadband services in the specific areas not covered by the NBS are available at www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3879">The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) provides funding to Community Based Organisations for the installation of energy efficiency measures including cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and energy efficient lighting in low income dwellings in their respective geographic areas.  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  The WHS provides these measures free or at a nominal cost to the householder.  In the last number of years over 20,000 homes have been substantially upgraded by the WHS.  In 2009, some €20 million has been made available to the scheme.  This greatly increased level of funding is expected to support energy efficiency interventions in up to 15,000 low income homes this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3880">As shown in the following table, there are 21 community based organisations, currently delivering the WHS, which represents coverage of just over two-thirds of the country.  Under an initiative to extend the scheme nationwide in 2009, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) plans to commence the introduction of additional community based organisations to the scheme from the end of March 2009.  In the interim, SEI is accepting contact details for householders outside of existing coverage and will notify applicants as the scheme becomes available in their area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3881">A call for proposals by additional community based organisations is expected at the end of March 2009 and will be published on the SEI website at www.sei.ie/warmerhomes.  Expressions of interest can be emailed to warmerhomes@sei.ie.  The expression of interest should contain the contact details of the organisation, the proposed area of coverage, the number of staff and the source of the staff places such as Pobail, or FÁS.  A full list of existing providers and the areas covered is outlined in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_3952">A Geothermal Working Group was established in 2008 to set out the options for the development of a proportionate and realistic regulatory regime for geothermal energy utilisation in Ireland.  As part of this process, a public consultation was held between June and August 2008.  Over 30 submissions were received, mainly from people and organisations closely associated with geothermal development in Ireland.  The results of the consultation exercise are currently being analysed.  I expect the Working Group to report to me shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3953">The Working Group will report on effective regulatory and other measures that could be taken to increase the contribution of geothermal energy to meeting Ireland's targets for use of alternative energy.  The legal aspects of a regulatory framework are among the issues under examination.  Complex legal issues arise and consideration of these will impact on the timing of the Report, which I expect to receive later this year.  I will decide on the need for legislation after I have considered the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_3955">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources currently employs two former civil servants who are also in receipt of a Civil Service pension.  In the first case the services of a former staff member of my Department are being retained on a part-time basis for which he is paid at a daily rate.  Since his retirement in mid 2008 he has been paid a total of €29,721 in salary and expenses.  His Civil Service pension is currently €38,764 per annum.  The abatement principle was applied in setting his level of fees so as to ensure that this rate plus pension does not exceed his pre-retirement salary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3956">In the second case the individual concerned has been engaged by the Department since October 2008.  In that time the Department has paid €11,000 for his services.  This cost is shared with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As this individual was a career servant in another Department, this Department does not have details of his Civil Service pension, which is a matter for the Paymaster General's Office and his former Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3980">It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to unenclosed and unimproved land, normally referred to as unenclosed lands.  This describes land that was never improved or enclosed by man-made boundaries for agricultural use other than extensive grazing.  In the context of afforestation in Ireland, these lands tend, in general, to be the most unproductive being peat lands or lands located on the exposed slopes of upland areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3981">As the lands covered by the classification unenclosed lands is not a homogenous entity and includes an array of soil types and locations it is necessary to closely examine all proposals for afforestation on these lands on their merits.  There is no formal ban proposed on afforestation on these lands.  However, any application for planting in these areas must be carefully examined to determine any potential environmental impact of that planting.  It must also have regard to the range of national and European environmental Directives, legislation and regulations that are designed to protect the unique characteristics of, and habitats within, these areas.  Where applications for afforestation come within areas designated for protection under such Directives or legislation, my Department must consult with other statutory bodies before deciding on the applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_4020">The Common Agricultural Policy constrains the financial assistance that can be afforded to poultry producers.  Usually, such assistance is linked to avian health or welfare  considerations. For example, a scheme was put in place to compensate farmers, who suffered losses arising from the fall-off in consumer confidence, when there was widespread negative publicity surrounding avian influenza in 2006. This amounted to just under €500,000. In 2007, assistance was provided under the Water Chlorination Grant Scheme which amounted to €1.17 million. There is also a current scheme of financial assistance for flockowners in whose flocks certain types of salmonella have been detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4021">I am aware of the difficulties facing the poultry industry here.  I have undertaken a number of initiatives to assist the industry in maintaining market share in the Irish retail sector which is the primary outlet for Irish-produced poultry.  The Bord Bia Poultry Quality Assurance Scheme is a key tool in promoting Irish poultry. The Bord is continuously engaged in developing and widening the scope of the Scheme which has been accredited under EN45011 by the national accreditation board.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">Labelling continues to be an issue for the sector.  I believe there should be country of origin labelling on all meats and my Department has been in extensive communication over the past year with the European Commission with a view to making such labelling compulsory. While the Commission adopted a negative opinion in relation to our proposal for national legislation, I will continue to press for country of origin labelling in the context of the Commission's proposal for a new regulation on food information. The Department of Health and Children is the lead Department for that proposal and my officials remain in contact with it on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4023">Another issue facing the poultry sector is compliance with legislation on the protection of the environment. The Intensive Livestock Group was established in my Department to assist poultry and pig producers in finding viable solutions to manure disposal problems.  Producers, processors and Teagasc are represented on this group, whose work is continuing.  I have also asked the Poultry expert Group to reconvene so that it can review its recommendations in the light of developments over the last year and consider what further issues warrant consideration. The Group's 2007 report focused on a range of issues including labelling, environmental protection, welfare legislation and feeding stuffs. The Group will meet within the next fortnight.</p>

            <p eId="para_4029">Following receipt of PCB and/or dioxin positive test results, movement restrictions were placed on 26 cattle farms and a decision taken to slaughter the cattle on those farms that had been or may have been exposed to contaminated feed.

Officials in my Department have completed a protocol covering the de-restriction of holdings once certain conditions are complied with. These conditions relate to the removal and slaughter of all affected cattle, the removal of contaminated feed, the decontamination of feed storage areas and removal of potentially affected slurry from tanks.  This protocol is being issued to farmers involved and once they have complied with the necessary requirements, the farms will be derestricted</p>

            <p eId="para_4042">Dairy product prices reached record high levels in 2007 and early 2008 and producer prices also peaked in that time.  Most CAP market instruments were suspended as they were not necessary at that time.  Since then international dairy product prices have fallen back considerably, although the average Irish producer price for 2008 was similar to the 2007 price.  Indications are that markets will remain weak in the first half of 2009 and I, along with other Agriculture Ministers, made clear to Commissioner Fischer Boel that a range of supports would help to restore confidence and put a floor under market prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_4043">The Commission initially responded in November by commencing the 2009 butter private storage scheme two months early.  Then, in January, the Commissioner announced further measures to assist the dairy sector.  These included a commitment under the Intervention system to purchase more than the fixed quantities of butter (30,000 tonnes) and Skimmed Milk Powder (109,000 tonnes) if the market situation requires it.  In addition, she announced the reintroduction of export refunds for butter, milk powders and cheese and these were reinstated on 22nd January.</p>
            <p eId="para_4044">The activation of these measures is an important step in the process of stimulating demand for dairy products.    The second tender for export refunds took place at last week's management committee meeting and the level of refunds was increased generally.  Intervention for butter and SMP will open on the 1st March and should help stabilise the market.  When the Intervention quantity limits are reached, a tendering process will operate for the purchase of additional quantities.  However, it is important that the Commission is vigorous in the implementation of these market measures and my Department will continue to press for them to be set at an appropriate level to support the dairy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4045">It is worth noting that while we are facing short-term uncertainty, analysis shows that the long-term outlook is bright.  The main international forecasting organisations predict global growth in wealth and population in the medium term.  This will present new opportunities for quality producers like Ireland, and all areas of the dairy sector can expect to reap the rewards.  In the meantime, I will continue to monitor developments in the dairy sector closely and intervene again with the Commissioner as the market situation evolves.</p>

         asked the

         the scientific justification for the introduction of new rules in respect of KW days at sea regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [7637/09]

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_824">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_4051">The new rules restricting fishing vessels' days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU's revised Cod Recovery Plan.  The revised plan was adopted at the EU Fisheries Councils in November and December 2008 and is set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008 and Annex IIa of the 2009 TAC and Quota Regulation (EC) No 43/2009.  It replaced the original Cod Recovery Plan, which was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC) No 423/2004.  Following intensive negotiations, Ireland secured the removal of the cod stock in the Celtic Sea (off the south coast) from the scope of the revised plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">The original plan was introduced in order to promote the recovery of four cod stocks in Community waters of the north-east Atlantic Ocean.  The plan was formulated in response to warnings from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) that these stocks were in decline and were in danger of collapse.  For the four stocks, the plan limited fishing effort, set total allowable catches (TACs), restricted mesh sizes, and closed fishing areas with a view to helping the stocks to recover to sustainable levels within a 5-to-10 year period.  Unfortunately, scientific assessments have shown that, after four years of application, the conservation measures of the original recovery plan have not reduced fishing mortality to the extent considered necessary for rebuilding the four cod stocks.  Scientific advice from the EU's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) found that, of the four cod stocks covered by the plan, only the North Sea stock showed some sign of recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">The slow progress made towards achieving the Cod Recovery Plan's goals prompted a revision of the original plan.  The EU Commission drew on scientific advice from ICES and the STECF, as well as consultations with stakeholders, including Regional Advisory Councils, to develop the revised plan.  This plan replaces the biomass targets of the original plan with new targets expressed as optimum fishing rates which are intended to achieve sustainable catches of cod.</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">To achieve these optimum fishing rates, the plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings (expressed in kilowatt-days) for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to the national level.  Member States have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea (ICES area VIIa) and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland (ICES area VIa).  The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of an EU Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each Member State in the areas during a reference period of 2004-2006 or 2005-2007 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4055">Under the plan, each Member State is required to introduce a licensing regime to manage its effort allocations.  Any vessel longer than 10 metres overall must have an authorisation from its Member State in order to operate in one of the designated areas using the fishing gears covered by the plan.  Member States can decide on the method of allocating their national pools of fishing effort, which are broken down by fishing gear type.  Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, the Department introduced a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort for the period from 1 February to 30 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4056">I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am happy to make amendments where proposed by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) within the legal framework that has been established.</p>

            <p eId="para_4068">My Department holds data on temporary accommodation on a county basis rather than on an individual area basis.  I attach for the Deputy's information details held by this Department of the schools in Cork City and County renting prefabricated units in the attached tabular statement.  The average annual rental cost per prefab unit in Cork City and County area is €14,022.  As the Deputy will appreciate the cost per unit will vary depending on the size, type and age of each unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4069">The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short timeframe.  My Department contributes 95% towards the cost of rental of temporary accommodation for primary schools with permanent recognition, where the need for additional accommodation has been established.  The school authority will pay a local contribution of the balance of 5% subject to a maximum local contribution of €3175 in the financial year January to December.</p>

            <p eId="para_5206">I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 446 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5207">The information sought by the Deputy is given in the attached tabular statement.  These details relate to all prefabricated units used by the schools for a variety of purposes in addition to housing mainstream classes such as use as resource rooms and for storage.  The information was obtained following a survey of over 900 schools across the country regarding their use of prefabricated accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5208">The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short timeframe.  My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5209">In July of last year I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation and who are being given approval for grant aid to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.  Expenditure incurred on the maintenance or upkeep of accommodation — temporary or permanent — is a recurrent cost as distinct from a capital cost.  Such expenditure falls to be funded from schools' recurrent sources of funding which are financed from capitation grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5210">A devolved minor works grant is also paid to all fully recognised primary schools annually.  This grant provides school authorities with the funds to carry out ongoing repairs of a minor nature on school buildings.  It allows the school to prioritise how the money is spent on their schools without the need to interface with my Department.  Schools are not required to provide a return on the breakdown of expenditure under the capitation or minor works grants to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_19837">The decision on eligibility for student maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority, either the local authority or VEC, as appropriate.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in exceptional circumstances.  In order to establish the candidate's status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's ordinary/permanent address from the 1st October of the year preceding entry to college.  Examples of the type of documentary evidence which would establish residence are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_19838">(i) Utility bills, such as a telephone, gas or ESB bill;</p>
            <p eId="para_19839">(ii) Evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB);</p>
            <p eId="para_19840">(iii) Official documentation from any Government Department e.g. The Department of Social and Family Affairs or the Revenue Commissioners (if any).</p>
            <p eId="para_19841">The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof is submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the schemes. This requires the candidate to supply appropriate evidence verifying his status.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_19842">Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_19852">I propose to take Questions Nos. 448, 456, 459, 470, 486, 489, 502, 503 and 505 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_19853">The Deputies will be aware that all primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD).  All primary schools were given these additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils.  Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_19854">The Deputies will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1.  My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class.  In the schools in question, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum.  These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.  I would like to clarify for Deputy Ó Snodaigh that the total enrolment in these classes is 534 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_19855">In 2005 when the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.</p>

            <p eId="para_19857">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need for SNA support.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_19858">My officials have been in contact with the NCSE regarding special needs assistant support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The NCSE have confirmed that the child in question has access to a full-time shared SNA and that this level of SNA support is considered sufficient to meet his care needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

In that context, and provided all the schemes concerned agree, it is proposed that the assets of these schemes would be transferred to the State together with the liabilities which would then be effectively met by the State on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Legislation would be required to give effect to the proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_20135">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_20136">My Department is currently finalising the position of individual schools and Vocational Education Committees (VECs) in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes includes appellate mechanisms under which schools and VECs can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support. The final allocation to a school/VEC is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_20137">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools/VECs for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>

            <p eId="para_20139">The information regarding the number of second level teachers on fixed term contracts as requested by the Deputy is being compiled and will be forwarded to her.  Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned.  The number of fixed-term contract teaching posts in individual schools is therefore a matter for the school authorities subject to remaining within their approved teacher allocation.</p>

Cork, was handed over to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in May 2008. The NDFA advertised the bundle in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEC) on 20th May 2008.  This tender competition is being procured using the competitive dialogue procedure as provided for under Community Directive 2004/EC/18 and three Short-listed Candidates were invited by the NDFA to commence the dialogue process on the 18th September 2008. During this process, the Candidates will develop their design and construction solutions as well as commercial proposals for each of the six schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_20142">A number of formal meetings are under way with each of the Candidates to assess the developing solutions during the dialogue, at the end of which process the NDFA will then invite final, fixed price tenders.  The expected timeframe for these final tenders is summer 2009.  Following evaluation of the tenders received, an announcement on the appointment of the Preferred Tenderer, being the most economically advantageous tender, is anticipated in early autumn 2009. Construction is expected to commence, subject to the planning process, in early 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_20144">In the context of the implementation of the recommendations of Report No. 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, my Department sought details of remuneration being paid to senior staff from all relevant institutions. Details supplied by Trinity College Dublin (TCD) in June 2008 included allowances to certain senior staff which had not been sanctioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_20145">My Department has at all times indicated to third-level institutions that the levels of remuneration sanctioned for all posts, including senior staff, should not, under any circumstances, be exceeded without prior approval. Furthermore, the Government decided that where unapproved payments were being made to senior staff in third-level institutions, no further increases should be implemented  until the position was regularised. My Department has, therefore, not issued sanction to date for those persons comprehended by Report No. 42 in TCD who are or were in receipt of unauthorised allowances.  My Department is reviewing the position with TCD to ensure that the remuneration levels of the relevant staff are regularised and in full compliance with the recommendations outlined in Report No 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.</p>

            <p eId="para_20147">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified  care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_20148">The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_20173">I can assure the Deputy that supports are in place to enable schools both to help prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_20174">Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_20175">In 2007 my Department published, on its website, policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies and takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes. Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. These guidelines have been informed by broad consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_20176">I have previously indicated that once schools have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the NEWB Guidelines, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own Guidelines.  This review will commence shortly and will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in international best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_20177">The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) was established in 2006 in response to the recommendation in "School Matters", the report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools. The NBSS is currently working with 50 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.  The National Centre for Technology in Education's Webwise Internet Safety initiative includes an integrated educational programme with the following elements: 1. The development of an integrated educational programme in partnership with the SPHE Support Service called — Be Safe_Be Webwise, which is delivered in the context of the SPHE module on Personal Safety by the SPHE Second Level Support Service. 2. Delivery of Internet Safety Seminars for parents in schools in partnership with the National Parents Council Primary, with over 150 seminars held since 2007. 3. Provision of Internet safety continuing professional development training for teachers. 4. The Watch Your Space awareness campaign, which was launched in February 2007 seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line.  The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the NCTE. This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_20178">Earlier this month, the NCTE launched a social marketing campaign, combining blanket and targeted messages delivered through a wide range of media channels and involving children and young people themselves, to the promotion of effective responses to cyberbullying by young people. This campaign is on-going and is supported by traditional and on-line media services including: RTE, SKY, Nickelodeon, MTV, City Channel, Google, Microsoft, Eircom, Meteor, and Bebo.  Dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme. I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_20179">The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_20181">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_20182">The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_20183">The appeal process is set out in the Staffing Schedule and the first meeting of the Appeal Board will take place in May, 2009. It is open to the school referred to by the Deputy to apply under this process on the standard application form which is available on my Department's website, www.education.ie. The closing date for application for initial Appeal Board meeting is 29 April, 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_20193">The establishment of classes for mild general learning disability predates many of the developments in special education policy in recent years and we now have a system for providing schools with supports for children with high incidence special needs, including mild general learning disability (MGLD), through the General Allocation Model. All primary schools, including those in Co Mayo, were allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_20194">The Deputy will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. In the schools in question, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum. These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes. All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  The number of pupils involved in the class being suppressed in County Mayo is 3.</p>

            <p eId="para_20196">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for pupils with special educational needs in line with their assessed disability. Pupils with disabilities may be entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the assessment places the pupil in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as having a low incidence category of disability, as defined by my Department's circular.</p>
            <p eId="para_20197">In circumstances where a child has a low incidence disability, this may automatically attract an individual resource teaching allocation. Such applications should be referred to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) by the school.  Templetuohy NS has been allocated a full-time resource teacher and a shared learning support/resource teacher post (LS/RT) with 20 of the hours in the school meeting the educational needs of pupils with high incidence special needs and learning support needs. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support.</p>
            <p eId="para_20198">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local SENOs, for allocating resource teachers, for pupils with a low incidence disability, and special needs assistants to schools to support pupils with special needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_20217">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_20218">The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details provided by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for consideration and direct reply.  The Deputy will also be aware that the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 makes provision for an education plan for each individual pupil with special educational needs, and this will become mandatory when the relevant sections of the Act are commenced. In preparation for this, the NCSE have published guidelines on the Individual Education Plan process and a copy issued to all primary and post primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year. These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans. It is the NCSE's intention that these guidelines will provide a benchmark for best practice pending the implementation of the Act and that schools will use these guidelines to draw up school policies and procedures in relation to individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_20219">My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.

A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department's website on www.education.ie.  The current hourly rate of payment is €44.33 for a qualified primary teacher and €49.60 for a qualified post primary teacher.

            <p eId="para_20233">In 2005, it was decided that an interim transport arrangement would apply to some students from the Limerick City catchment area attending a post-primary centre in County Limerick pending the outcome of the Area Development Plan for Limerick City and its environs.  In December, 2008, on completion of the Area Development Plan, a five year ‘road map' for school buildings in Limerick City and environs was published.</p>
            <p eId="para_20234">The review of catchment boundaries in County Limerick will be considered in the context of this Plan and in the light of the outcome of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme including catchment boundaries. The Steering Committee to oversee the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme has recently been established.  This review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The review will be carried out as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews recently approved by Government and, when completed, will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_20238">I wish to advise the Deputy that all primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD). All primary schools were given these additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_20239">The Deputy will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. In the schools in question, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum. These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_20240">In 2005 when the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  The number of schools involved in MGLD classes in County Cork is 6 and the number of pupils therein 26.</p>
            <p eId="para_20241">Special Needs Assistant (SNAs) posts are allocated to schools to enable them support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  There are a total of 32 SNAs employed in these 6 schools at present to meet the needs of all the enrolled pupils in these schools who have disabilities and who also have additional care needs.  Some of these pupils may attend the special classes.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating SNAs to schools to support children with special needs and for reviewing and adjusting the SNA support in the school. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria for allocating these posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_20273">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_20274">I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_20275">The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand. Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule it is a fact of life that one single pupil change in enrolment can cause a school to lose or gain a teacher. In recent years when improvements were being made to the staffing schedule it was also the case that there were winners and losers depending on individual enrolment profiles. If I were to change the staffing schedule to allow the schools that are due to lose a teacher to retain that teaching post I would be treating them differently from other schools with the exact same number on the rolls and I do not propose to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_20276">I have a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar enrolment. The system should not create anomalies or operate on the basis that one or more schools should be treated differently to others.</p>
            <p eId="para_20277">The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_20281">The majority of the 692 schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision as well as  after school clubs and homework clubs. These measures are considered to be key elements of the supports provided by 124 School Completion Programme projects throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_20282">After-School Supports provided under the School Completion Programme focus on the personal and social development of young people, aiming to enrich their overall educational experience by providing fun activities that tap into the many talents of young people. Programmes that focus on activities like Drama, Music, Art, Craftwork and Sport enable children to develop a range of creative and sporting skills. These activities help to boost self-esteem, have positive consequences for the classroom and are particularly important for academically weaker students.</p>
            <p eId="para_20283">The School Completion Programme encompasses both primary and post-primary levels and focuses on young people between the ages of 4 and 18 years. SCP is a key component of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools) the  action plan for educational inclusion, which discriminates positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_20284">The objective of the School Completion Programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. The programme aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. Core activities include targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of  school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  The programme has developed an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents, relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_20285">The 124 projects include 81 projects originally selected to participate in SCP in 2002 and 43 new SCP projects created in 2006/07. A total of 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools are now participating in the School Completion Programme.  The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP). The funding allocation to the School Completion Programme since 2005 is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_20286">2005 —  €24m</p>
            <p eId="para_20287">2006 — €24.7m</p>

            <p eId="para_20290">Breakfast clubs provide a caring and supportive environment where young people can engage with their peers in a social setting. This also provides an opportunity to prepare for the school day. Parents are also encouraged to become involved in running breakfast clubs.</p>

            <p eId="para_20296">Applications for the Summer Works Scheme are currently being assessed and schools will be notified of the outcome in due course.  Minor Works Grants of around €27m were paid out to primary schools throughout the country for the 2008/2009 school year to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.  Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50  per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_20297">Devolved funding under the emergency works scheme continues to be available in 2009. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an unforeseen event of a capital nature that can arise during the course of a school year.  Funding is available in 2009 for the remaining Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Scheme projects either currently on site or concluding the architectural planning process with a view to going on site this year.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_874">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_20299">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board also has responsibility to conduct research into underlying causes for poor attendance and disseminating results of such research to assist schools in developing codes of behaviour and attendance strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_20300">The Board's service has developed incrementally and there are currently 104 posts of which 85 are appointed in direct service delivery. The Board operates through 5 Regional Teams covering Dublin City; Leinster North; Leinster South; Munster and West/North West with service delivery personnel located at 29 locations nationwide. The service personnel is comprised of, 5 Regional Managers (RMs), 13 Senior Educational Welfare Officers (SEWOs) and 67 Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs). In addition to these there is one Director of Educational Services who has responsibility for and manages delivery of services through the five teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_20301">The budget allocation to the Board has also followed this incremental trend increasing from €4.310m in 2003 to €10.085m in 2008 as the service network developed.  The Board's network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is the key means by which the Board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child attends and benefits from education. EWOs deal with approximately 10,000 cases, involving children with reported school attendance difficulties, per annum. Officers work closely with the family, the school and other support services to address the particular issues for each child. The needs of children can vary considerably from those who are not attending school, to those for whom there is no school place while in other cases, placement in an alternative education programme like Youthreach may be more appropriate. In exceptional cases where difficulties arise with placement home tuition hours, to facilitate ongoing minimum education until a suitable long term solution is put in place by the Board, is sanctioned by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_20302">In addition to case work on referrals from schools EWOs also provide assistance and advice to parents whose children experience school attendance difficulties by arranging for continuation of education through alternative placement or assisting with application for home tuition. They also work closely with schools offering advice and assistance on developing policies to encourage children to attend school regularly. At both school and community level EWOs work in co-operation with other agencies to integrate delivery of services to schools, families and children. Furthermore EWOs also handle queries relating to The Educational (Welfare) Act and on school attendance issues in general. Where required the EWO has responsibility to initiate legal proceedings under the Act to safeguard the educational welfare of a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_20303">The Board also has particular responsibility under the Act in terms of children who are educated in settings outside of a recognised school. Under Section 14 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, parents of such children must apply to the Board to have their child registered and an assessment is then carried out. Such assessments are conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. The aim of the assessment is to ensure that each child receives "a certain minimum education".</p>
            <p eId="para_20304">The Board operates a Lo-call Helpline to inform parents and guardians about their legal role and responsibilities under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. It is manned by EWO's and provides practical help to parents and schools on educational issues. Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. In 2008 the Board issued all schools with Guidelines on Developing a Code of Behaviour following a broad consultation with all  stakeholders. The Board held the first national conference on school attendance and participation which examined Attendance Strategies for Schools. The conference was the first step in the development of guidelines to schools on school attendance strategies. Its main aim was to provide an in-depth understanding of the problem of absenteeism and then to explore strategies to  address it.</p>
            <p eId="para_20305">With regard to the issue raised by the Deputy the annual cost of providing the services of the NEWB involves pay which is determined in accordance with standard public sector pay scales and additional overhead costs associated with service delivery which are met from the overall allocation to the Board.  I am informed by the Board that its accounts for 2008 are provisional pending audit by the C&amp;AG. I am also advised that pay costs for service delivery staff amounted to €4.882m and included pay costs for RMs, SEWOs, EWOs, LoCall Helpline and the Director Educational Welfare Services. In addition the pay costs for service delivery administration staff amounted to €417k which included head office and regional office personnel who provide direct administrative support for delivery of services to schools, parents and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_20306">Pay costs for core services personnel of the NEWB e.g. HR; Finance; IT and Corporate Services including the pay costs of the Chief Executive Officer amounted to €803k. The Board also has a number of retired personnel and the pension payroll accounted for €260k of the allocation for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_20307">The Board also advise that Non-Pay costs of €4.1m were incurred in 2008. Given that the greater portion of the pay costs of the Board are directly associated with service delivery, the greater proportion of non pay costs can also be associated with supporting the delivery of the Boards services. Non pay costs covered expenditure for rents, rates, light and heat, security, insurance, management fees and repairs &amp; maintenance for 31 offices in 29 locations (Head Office, Dublin City Regional Office and Leinster North Regional Office are located at Green Street).  Also included within the Non-Pay expenditure are costs for IT Systems &amp; Communications Infrastructure, Landline &amp; Mobile phones, Professional &amp; Legal fees, Travel and Subsistence, Research &amp; Promotions, Staff Training, Health &amp; Safety, Postage &amp; Stationary and Consultancy costs. The overall budget for the National Educational Welfare Board for 2008 amounted to some €10.485m which included the Grant allocation from the Department as well  as a cash carryover.</p>

            <p eId="para_20309">There are 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs) established under, and governed according to the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 2001. Each VEC is a statutory body with its own corporate status.  Financial allocations are made to the VECs as part of a block grant. VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets and each VEC is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need. Accordingly, my Department does not have available to it a detailed breakdown of the distribution of funds by VECs across their schools and head offices.  However, I can again confirm that VECs spent approximately €58.5 million on what is termed administration pay in 2008, and a breakdown of this expenditure in respect of each VEC is attached for the Deputy's information.</p>

            <p eId="para_20458">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_20459">My Department is currently finalising the position of individual schools and Vocational Education Committees (VECs), including County Donegal VEC, in relation to their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes includes appellate mechanisms under which schools and VECs can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support. The final allocation to a school/VEC is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_20460">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools/VECs for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools/VECs are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>

            <p eId="para_20464">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, caterfor all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_20465">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  In 1993, the Department issued a circular (M 51/93) to post-primary schools, advising of a memorandum of agreement between the Department and the post-primary schools managerial association, that selection for the purposes of enrolment based on academic ability should be discontinued.</p>
            <p eId="para_20466">Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_20467">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  Home Tuition support may be provided, on application, as a temporary interim measure, for pupils who do not have a school placement or are unable to secure a school place.</p>

I can confirm to the Deputy that there are no unestablished officers currently employed by my Department, in receipt of a civil service pension.
