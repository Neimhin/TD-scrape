#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to convey to the British Government the concerns of the Irish community in Britain regarding the impact of the proposed changes to the Licensing Act on that community and if he will seek assurances that the new law will not have an adverse effect on Irish cultural activities in the United Kingdom.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is No. 1, Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, which incorporated into Irish law the provisions of Article 3a of the television without frontiers directive. Article 3a of the directive allows member states to designate certain events as events of major importance to society to ensure that a substantial proportion of the population is not deprived of the possibility of watching such events on free television services. It was laid before the House four weeks ago. In accordance with section 2 of the Act, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has designated the following events: the summer Olympics; the all-Ireland senior inter-county football and hurling finals; Ireland's home and away qualifying games in the European championships—

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Is it in order to read out the details of a statutory instrument on the Order of Business?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Leader of the House is explaining the matter for the benefit of the House.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I have already read the Order Paper.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	It would be a different story if I did not read it. The list includes Ireland's games in the European football championship finals and the FIFA World Cup finals; the opening games, semi-finals and final of the European football championship finals and the FIFA World Cup finals; Ireland's games in the Rugby World Cup finals; the Irish Grand National; the Irish Derby and the Nations Cup at the Dublin Horse Show. Next on the Order of Business is No. 2, Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken after No. 1 until 1.30 p.m., to resume again at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4 p.m.; No. 3, statements on the Convention on the Future of Europe with Deputy John Bruton, a member of the Presidium of the Convention, who will make a 30 minute statement followed by statements by each spokesperson for five minutes and then Members may ask questions; and No. 15, motion No. 24, motion re motor insurance for young drivers, to be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Is No. 1 being taken without debate?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Leader will agree that the only way the House can work properly and effectively is when there is a measure of co-operation between the Government and the Opposition in respect of the business of the day. Yesterday was a parliamentary shambles, however, because information that was absolutely germane to the debate was only given at the start of Committee Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, the Minister responsible for the legislation was not with us and important amendments could not be tabled because of the timeframe involved. Today it is proposed to guillotine the legislation at 4 p.m. There will be no co-operation from this side of the House on the Order of Business, as has been the case during the past week. I propose once again that No. 2 be deleted from the Order of Business.I stress to the saner Members on the Government side of the House, particularly the Leader, who I know is not behind this, to draw back from this and take time out. We are going through a parliamentary nonsense. Even at this late stage, the Leader should amend the Order of Business, remove Committee Stage of the Bill and engage in meaningful dialogue with the Opposition.Will the Leader respond to the offensive and incorrect remarks by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Lower House last night when he questioned the actions of the Information Commissioner and suggested that the latter had overstepped his powers? Does she agree with that assessment? I know she does not and I believe the House should take an opinion on the matter. The legislation passed in 1997—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Senator Hayes, the proceedings of the Lower House are separate from those of the Seanad.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	—ensured that the commissioner's voice was entitled to be heard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wishes to muzzle the commissioner and I suspect that the House has a very different view on that matter.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I concur with everything Senator Brian Hayes has just said. It is important to recognise that, in terms of how we do our business, as Senator Leyden said many times yesterday, this situation is unprecedented. We have found that the Government was hiding from us information issued by the Information Commissioner. The Government is opposed to that information being made available to us and we are not being allowed due time to have consultation with the senior people involved in the drawing up of the Bill. The Government has decided to press ahead without speaking to the senior civil servant of the State who is charged with responsibility for the matter. The final and ultimate sanction, which the Leader said she would never do, is that a guillotine will be dropped on the debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill at 4 p.m. That is outrageous and I hope the Leader is suitably ashamed. I know she is under instruction, but I hope that privately she will feel the same sense of shame for this House as that felt by other Members. Although the Leader said she would never go along with that approach, we are now forced into a situation whereby the House is being brought into grave disrepute.I also wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business. I circulated the following motion a short time ago on behalf of the Independent Senators:That Seanad Éireann expresses its thanks and appreciation to the Information Commissioner for bringing to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas vital information regarding the operation of the Freedom of Information Act and affirms his statutory entitlement to make such a report.I request that, as an amendment, that motion be taken as No. 1 on the Order of Business today. In no way should any elected person wish to leave the House without putting on the record their views as to whether we should be party to the muzzling and stemming of information from a most crucial and important source in relation to the business before it. That we should be part of such a charade is unbelievable. For our successors, who may look back on what is now happening in the House, it is crucial that we—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The text of Senator O'Toole's motion was received in the Seanad office only today and is currently being circulated. It will appear on tomorrow's Order Paper. The Chair is not prepared to waive the requirements of notice set out in Standing Order 25 in this case and I am ruling that this motion is not in order for discussion this morning. However, if the Senator wishes to propose that statements be made on the subject matter, I will accept that as an amendment.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	15	That is very helpful. Although I would have much preferred to move the motion and may do so at another time, it is crucially important for fair-minded and serious legislators and public representatives on all sides of the House to have the opportunity of stating their views as to whether we should engage in deep legislative consideration without having access to information. Undoubtedly, any examination of events over these three days will show that serious attempts were made to ensure that the Information Commissioner did not influence the outcome of these discussions.The issue of whether the commissioner's action yesterday was acceptable to Government is separate. The fact is that he was not going to be consulted in the first instance. It is unacceptable that a major change to the way the House does its business should be instituted without consultation. This is outrageous and we cannot proceed on that basis.In deference to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I will not challenge the ruling of the Chair for a second day in succession. Yesterday, it was decided that amendments would not be taken due to lack of time, despite the fact that we were in negotiation on a Bill when there was information in our pigeon-holes which even the Minister of State and the Department did not possess. How will anybody explain this to their children who may be working on a history thesis 20 years from now? Good luck to them.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I know Senators on the Government side are embarrassed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Senator O'Toole—
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I am sorry they are being mistreated by their manipulators.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Chair's ruling relates only to today's business. Is the Senator proposing an amendment on the basis of statements?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I accept that. I now propose that, as No. 1, we take statements on the issue of yesterday's report from the Information Commissioner, expressing our appreciation – or otherwise – on that issue. That is my proposal.On the matter raised by the Leader in respect of major sporting events, that was one of the reasons I wanted those easily available when I raised this issue a few weeks ago. I still believe, in terms of business, that Senator Ryan was correct in saying it is not the appropriate place to deal with the matter, although I welcome what the Leader had to say. I am not sure whether it is a statutory instrument or a ministerial order. There are issues of which we need to be aware in that regard.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	21	On a point of clarification, Senator Ryan said it was on the Order Paper but, in fact, it is not. That is the reason I read out the list of events. However, it was circulated and laid before the Houses four weeks ago.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	22	On a technical issue in that regard, we need to know whether it is a statutory instrument or a ministerial order and whether it is a decision taken on the basis of a decision prior to a debate in the House or one which can be rescinded within 21 sitting days. We need to be aware of those issues before we can make decisions about taking it without debate. If it is a matter requiring a decision, I do not wish to take it without debate. However, that is really a type of side-show from what we are about today. We are again undermining the democratic process—
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	23	—and I hope people will at least take account of our views. Nobody can control the voices of those on the other side of the House, even if their votes can be controlled. At least, they are free to speak and I look forward to hearing their support on this issue.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The last time I saw Fianna Fáil in full flight trying to silence somebody, their target was the Ombudsman, who was making trouble for that party on that occasion. Now, it has allies who are apparently even more enthusiastic about silencing people than was Mr. C. J. Haughey at his worst. Perhaps Mr. Haughey's protégé is becoming more visible as a clone of the mentor.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	25	We have heard it all before.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Yes, and Senators on the Government side will hear it again with considerable vigour because they are caught badly on this issue. The real nature of the Government, which is running away with itself, has been exposed to public view. They have jumped into their bunkers and are afraid to debate. They ran away from Second Stage of this debate.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Absolutely not.

He was not in the House yesterday when we were present. He was the one who ran away.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	31	That is not a point of order. Senator Leyden should not refer to the absence of a Senator from the House.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Will the Chair explain to Senator Leyden what is a point of order?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Senator Ryan to continue without interruption.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I believe I have made my point.I formally second Senator Hayes's proposal that No. 2 be removed from the Order of Business. I also fully support Senator O'Toole's proposal that the sane voice of the Information Commissioner, a former very senior civil servant, ought to be introduced into this debate by a dispassionate consideration of his report. That involves not calling him names or telling him he should not say certain things which upset the Government. If the Leader persists in imposing the Bill on the House, perhaps she would invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who seems to have strong views on the matter, to take Committee Stage. That would solve many problems.Since the Progressive Democrats are obviously committed to this Bill with great enthusiasm and considerable colour, let us get in a Progressive Democrats Minister, one who grabbed headlines for himself on the front of The Irish Times this morning. Let him come in and deal with the debate. He apparently knows more about it than anybody else. He knows more about the Information Commissioner than anybody else. Why is he running away too, just like Fianna Fáil did last week?

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I raise another issue, that is, the extraordinary fact that the Department of Health and Children, over six weeks, cannot tell a Member of the other House how many committees and commissions have been set up to look at various aspects of the health service. That is the first part. Perhaps the Leader can get the Department to do what it apparently cannot do itself.Second, none of these committees and commissions has reported so far. Am I correct in assuming that none of them will report until after this obnoxious legislation is passed, in which case only the bits of the reports that suit the Government will ever be published? Is that what is going on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Are you seeking a debate?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	50	There are 205 apparently, but they do not know for certain. I would like to know if those committees are all being delayed until after the Government amends the Freedom of Information Act 1997, so that we will not know what they say. It is a mess created by this Government.On a very precise point of order, Standing Order 107 states that in committee a Bill shall be considered section by section. If this Bill concludes, as the Leader wishes, at some time this afternoon and a significant number of sections have not been reached, the House cannot just stop there because we would be in breach of Standing Orders. If the Leader wants to conclude, it is her duty to put a motion down under Standing Order 144 to override the provision in Standing Orders that a Bill must be debated section by section. If the Leader proposes to take a lump of them together without debate, it is her duty to propose a motion to this House to amend Standing Orders. It is up to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, with all due respect, to ensure that we work within Standing Orders.

It is a desperate situation which deserves the highest condemnation from all sides of this House and indeed all sections of society, given the fact that this affects young people who must take out very expensive mortgages in order to purchase their own home. I deplore the fact that the full extent of the rate reduction has not been passed on.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I want to raise an issue regarding the State's only Integrated Coastal Zone Management Initiative, that is, Bantry Bay Charter, which has been in operation in west Cork since 1997. It was set up under EU guidelines in conjunction with UCC, CIT and Cork County Council and brought together a number of competing interests regarding the use of the coastal zone in that area.Cork County Council has been funding this initiative to the tune of €50,000 per annum. The entire cost of running it is €179,000 per annum. Various Departments have refused to continue to fund this initiative, which was largely recognised by scientists and marine experts alike as being unique in Europe in terms of the delivery of its service.About a year ago the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, visited west Cork and gave a commitment to pass on the handling of coastal zone management to senior staff in his own Department.

Perhaps his mind was in Cheltenham. It is important that the Leader of the House should arrange for the Minister or one of his delegates, because he might have gone to Cheltenham, to come in to debate this serious issue.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I ask the Leader to seek the views of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on up-coming EU legislation which would allow free movement of medical practitioners within members state without being registered with the regulatory body in the state they are visiting. This means that a doctor can come into this country and practise for up to 16 weeks without being on the register of the Medical Council. That is not good for safe practice. It is not good for patients' safety and for the high standards to which we in this jurisdiction are accustomed. I ask the Leader to seek the Tánaiste's views on that legislation.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Yesterday evening, after a long and tortuous debate, we reached section 6 of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. No doubt this Bill is one of the most important measures to come before the Oireachtas in the past 20 years because it cuts across the fundamental rights already established under the 1997 Act.The Bill is being introduced in this House. Therefore this is the first attempt of the Oireachtas at debating the Bill and deciding on its merits or demerits. The purpose of Committee Stage is to enable the Legislature to undertake a root and branch analysis of each section and each amendment put forward by the Opposition or by the Government. At 4 p.m. today huge tranches of this Bill will not have been debated. If it were the other House that were given the privilege of dealing with this Bill, it would go to select committee and be dealt with, section by section, amendment by amendment. It would be given as much time as possible. There would be absolutely no containment and no restriction.The manner in which this is being bull-dozed and guillotined through shows absolute contempt for the Bill and for Parliament. It is manifestly wrong. The subject matter itself and the procedures of Parliament are too serious to allow this to happen. I believe that the Leader, in her heart of hearts, in her own conscience and mind, does not agree with this procedure. It is wrong, for example, that section 12, which is the core of the Bill, will not be reached today.

I plead with the Leader of the House, with whom I have discussed this matter, to go back to her Government superiors and ask for additional time for this Bill.I propose that No. 6 be taken before No. 1. This is a procedural detail to enable me to bring a Bill before the House. No. 6 is the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is published in my name.

Perhaps, as agreed earlier, we could have an early debate on this when the House reconvenes the week after next.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I second Senator O'Toole's proposal that we take the report of the Information Commissioner first on the Order of Business. I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a fine lawyer, but this report was incredibly useful to me as a legislator. We are legislators, but we are also citizens and we are curtailing our own rights in the legislation that is being put through the House. This matter should be addressed with some urgency.I would be grateful if the Leader would ask the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to explain the number of task forces and commissions that have been set up. I can assist Senator Ryan by saying that, according to a friend of mine, the number was 103 at the last count, although several have been established since then. A serious problem is the lack of reporting from many of these task forces. We heard today about the task force on radiotherapy, which was expected to report well over a year ago. Members of the medical profession thought that the report was not released before the general election because a centre was not to be set up in Wexford, but that was nearly a year ago. We have heard also of the serious problems in St. Luke's Hospital. Some of these reports must be released. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to explain why this is not happening. The hiatus between being set up and reporting is far too long.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I formally second the proposal of Senator Higgins.Senator Henry mentioned St. Luke's Hospital. I listened to an interesting interview this morning on the difficulties the hospital is having in staying within its budget and the pressure on resources. The report on radiotherapy facilities was promised before the general election. It is widely envisaged that centres in Dublin, Galway and Cork will be recommended. I have raised twice on the Adjournment the urgent necessity of providing a facility for the mid-west region. In our area there is a charity trust that is prepared to provide funding for the capital resources and all we need is the staffing. Pressure is being put on St. Luke's because people are coming in from all parts of the country, particularly my own area in the mid-west.The Leader is a reasonable person and she knows that at times the Adjournment debate can be very frustrating. One receives a bland response, which never actually addresses one's query. She might take up with the Minister for Health and Children the urgent necessity of providing a facility in the mid-west region.

Many relevant points have been made by Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole, Higgins and Ryan. Tomorrow, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will hear representations from various mandarins, journalists, representatives from the media and the Information Commissioner. I understand that Deputy Fleming, the Chairman of the committee, has said that a statement would be issued. Before things go any further here, we would like to hear the result of these deliberations. I am sure the Leader, despite the orders from on high, could make a day or two available when we recommence the week after next. I urge the Leader to consider this. She has been reasonable in the past.We all know that Killarney National Park is one of the jewels in our crown. Within the park, by the Meeting of the Waters, there is a most attractive gem—

I know from talking to him that he is prepared to do so. He might be otherwise engaged at present, but we do not need him immediately. The Minister of State is responsible for much national property within the Office of Public Works and Dúchas, although a resolution is to made be the Government on the responsibilities of these two organisations.

This is a national tragedy, which must be addressed.Does the Leader have any more pertinent information regarding the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill?

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to come before the House to debate the proposed draft regulation on the maximum height restrictions for vehicles. Serious concerns have been expressed to me about transport equipment, in which people have invested massive amounts. If the regulations are implemented as proposed, much of this equipment could become obsolete.I would also like the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come before the House to explain why the Government has failed to implement the fourth EU insurance directive. The European Commission is threatening us with court action for failing to comply with this directive, the deadline for which was July 2002. This has serious implications for people involved in accidents in other EU states.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I know he has strong views on this matter because I met him in the corridor last night. We had a private conversation, but I imagine he would welcome the opportunity of placing on the record of the House the strong views he expressed to me.Attacks have been made on the Information Commissioner. To balance these, however, a senior academic from NUI Cork, who is qualified in this area, made it perfectly plain while speaking on RTE this morning that it was not only the entitlement but almost the responsibility of the commissioner to make an intervention such as he did.Yesterday's debate was a blot on the record of the Seanad. It was curtailed and some outrageous rulings were made. The gracious agreement of the Leader to allow us an opportunity of reading the document was rendered absolutely useless by the refusal of the Cathaoirleach to accept the amendments put down by Senator O'Toole, which arose directly from the reading of that document. He said they should be taken on Report Stage. This has had one clear technical result: the debate has been completely guillotined. People can only speak once on Report Stage. The Seanad has been neutered. What we are supposed to do here is probe the amendments and use them to tease out information. The Cathaoirleach forestalled that with an arbitrary and capricious decision. The reason I say this, before I am reproved, is that the only other interpretation would be that it was partisan and I am not prepared to make that accusation.With regard to absences and presences, there was a noticeable paucity of speakers – there were only about three Government Members present – on the other side of the House last night. That indicates a good deal of honourable unease in the Government party—

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am supporting my colleague and I am seeking a proper debate. The Leader, and various people on the Government side, asked why we could not get to section 12 of the Bill. The answer is that it is our responsibility to try to extract information and it is pretty difficult to do so when the Minister of State has no competence in the area and his advisers do not seem to know much either. This was the case yesterday, when we could not get answers. If this kind of legislation is to be rammed through the House and we cannot get answers from the Minister responsible, who is engaged elsewhere, we will stay here and do our best to act in a responsible way, as is required of us under the Constitution.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I have three more speakers, so I would appreciate if the Senator concluded.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Leader graciously accepted that there might be a need for a debate on Tibet. Will she examine the matter with more urgency and arrange a time for such a debate? When I raised the matter yesterday, I did not realise that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without consultation of either House of the Oireachtas or the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, has, on behalf of the people, made a violent change in the attitude of Ireland to Tibet. Without any substantiation, he has suggested that we accept Tibet is a part of China. This was never discussed, is not part of Government policy and contradicts what has been said by previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should further explain Garda rules under which a ludicrous situation recently obtained in a Dublin courts. In the instance to which I refer, the trial of a Mongolian national was aborted because the translator was not fully competent and was also a witness for the prosecution. It is quite bizarre that a witness for the prosecution was translating the contribution of the Mongolian national accused.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I support Senator Finucane's request to raise with the Minister for Health and Children his proposals for the radiotherapy unit in Limerick. The Minister will be aware that the Limerick proposal, in conjunction with a Dublin hospital, is already partly funded and will, therefore, not require enormous funding. In view of the urgency of obtaining a decision, will the Leader ask the Minister what is the status of the application and when we might have a decision on it?Senators have commented about the curtailment of time on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. A long-standing procedure in the Oireachtas allows for each section of a Bill to be taken by allocating limited time to each in order that they can all be debated within the overall time allocated. If the Whips could agree, it might be possible to have an arrangement whereby each section could be given adequate time for debate in order that one would not have a confusion of ten or 12 sections at the end of the period.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I support my Opposition colleagues' comments on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Our legislative function, as Members of the Upper House of the Oireachtas, is being undermined by the farcical process being played out this week. In light of the report of the Information Commissioner and the remarks of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I appeal to the Leader that this Bill be put into a cooling process until we hear from the Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the matter. In particular, we need to hear the more detailed remarks of the civil servants who drew up the report, which the Taoiseach is outrageously using as cover and as an excuse for amending the legislation. I support my colleagues in requesting that debate ends now, on Committee Stage.I request an urgent debate on the health services, which are clearly in a state of crisis. Our national hospitals, such as the Mater, Beaumont and St. Luke's, are reported daily as having serious difficulties with carrying out their basic functions. I further request that the Minister for Health and Children come before the House at the earliest possible opportunity to report on his stewardship, or lack thereof, of this important area.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	It is understandable that we are distracted by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 and the report of the Information Commissioner and I support the comments made in that context on this side of the House. However, let us not forget yesterday's inauguration of the International Criminal Court in the Hague. We passed a referendum two years ago to sign our participation with that court into law. At a time when we seem to be getting ever closer to war, we should plead for the rule of law in international affairs to be upheld. The people took the establishment of the International Criminal Court to heart and passed it into legislation by way of a referendum. Other countries have not yet done so and others have still not accepted it. As we approach war, let us ensure that the House does not turn its eye away from this matter.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I am going through the comments of Senators.Senator O'Toole described the arrangements for the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act as outrageous and muzzling and saw fit to use various other adjectives. He referred to the list of games I provided. When the Senator raised this matter previously, I told him he could arrange to have debates on any issues by informing the Cathaoirleach or me.Senator Ryan claimed there has been no debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. That is factually incorrect, since there was strong debate in the House, including several divisions, until 10.30 p.m. yesterday. Notwithstanding that, I do not cast aspersions on Senators who were not present. The Senator seconded Senator Hayes's proposed amendment and agreed with Senator O'Toole's amendment. He also requested that I invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the House. The Minister has been before the House regularly and I am sure would come here again, if requested.Senator Ryan also inquired about the precise number of commissions established by the Department of Health and Children. The Minister for Health and Children correctly accepts that the health sector needs to be thoroughly reviewed and action taken on foot of the results of the reviews. This matter was raised yesterday and it was decided to have a debate on the content of the two main reports after we receive them.Senator Glynn reasonably asked why the reduction of interest rates by the ECB is not being passed on in Ireland to the same degree as it apparently has in other countries.Senator McCarthy raised the Bantry Bay initiative on the use of the coastal zone, which has been funded by Cork County Council. He asked if the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has gone to Cheltenham. He has not. The Minister was in the House yesterday to complete the debate on the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) (Amendment) Bill 2003. I am not casting aspersions on those who were not present. I will pass the Senator's query on to the Minister. I presume he is asking that funding be provided.Senator Feeney requested that I raise with the Tánaiste the free movement of medical practitioners who do not come under the regulatory control of the European directive for 16 weeks. We have all heard alarming stories about unauthorised medical staff operating in such a context.Senator Higgins asked that today's debate go to a special committee. I agree with his proposal for No. 6, so we will proceed and arrange a time for debate. Senator Mansergh requested an early debate on social partnership, which would be worthwhile.Senator Henry seconded Senator O'Toole's amendment. I gather she does not disagree with the number of task forces, but wants to know when their results will be made public and acted upon.

Senator Finucane formally seconded the proposal of Senator Higgins. He also asked about radiotherapy services in the mid-western region from which many patients have to travel to St. Luke's which is upsetting in itself when they are in a poor state of health.Senator Coghlan asked that I reconsider the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill.

Members will be able to avail of the recess to study it in full.Senator Bannon asked about what might be done with regulations dealing with the height of vehicles with reference to tunnels. He also asked about the European insurance directive. While we will not be debating it tonight, a general debate is being held on the matter of the cost of insurance and the effect it is having on young people in particular.Senator Norris supported Senator O'Toole's call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come the Seanad. He also mentioned the senior lecturer we heard on "Morning Ireland" this morning. I must comment on what he said about the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and his advisers yesterday. I am sure all Members will join me in saying we found the Minister of State and his advisers to be both agreeable and amenable and that they did the best they could.

Senator Norris was very careful not to criticise, in any way, the Minister of State personally. He said the Minister of State was from another Department, did not have information to hand and that information was not available. That is correct. There was silence yesterday afternoon while the Minister of State consulted his advisers who did not have the answers.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	129	We were discussing section 6 which extends the number of areas in which a refusal can be made in circumstances where the head neither confirms nor denies the existence of information in the first place. I spoke to some of the Minister of State's officials yesterday after the debate and they persuaded me that there were some limited areas where it was appropriate to proceed in this way. Nonetheless, this is still structured in such a way as to leave it open to abuse. Our real difficulty is that where a refusal is made in those circumstances, it is not open to be tested. We cannot test, in particular, whether the public interest has been taken into account to the extent it should by the person making the decision.Perhaps the Minister of State can help me as I have never seen a refusal of this kind. Is it normal practice to refuse information while telling people such action is not intended to confirm or deny whether there is information available, or is somebody refused simpliciter? Is there a specific line in the refusal telling people the information may or may not be available? I seek a situation where people are informed that this provision is being invoked in order that they can appeal it to the Information Commissioner and can be properly reviewed.

The requester is to be informed he or she is being refused for those reasons and he or she can then go to the Information Commissioner to have him review the decision if he or she requires it.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 7, line 2, to delete paragraph (a).This amendment seeks to delete the provision in paragraph (a) which includes a reference to paragraph (c) of section 10(1) of the principal Act, which will state:(1) A head to whom a request under section 7 is made may refuse to grant the request if –(a) the record concerned does not exist or cannot be found after all reasonable steps to ascertain its whereabouts have been taken, (b) the request does not comply with section 7(1)(b),(c) in the opinion of the head, granting the request would, by reason of the number or nature of the records concerned or the nature of the information concerned, require the retrieval and examination of such number of records or an examination of such kind of the records concerned as to cause a substantial and unreasonable interference with or disruption of the other work of the public body concerned.I seek the deletion of this paragraph because up to now it has proven difficult enough to get information due to the reason I have just cited – it would mean too much work for the Department involved and cut across its primary work. The Bill extends the provision. If one reads the observations of the Information Commissioner, the provision was used wrongly by Departments. This will make it far easier for a public body to refuse requests on the basis that it would cause too much interference and disruption with the work of a unit – in other words, a subsection which could be a small section in a Department or public body. Not alone will a request be disqualified on the basis that it interferes with the work of the entire public sector, but section 7 will narrow down its application to allow requests to be disqualified if they disrupt the work of a unit within a public office. This provision is wide open for abuse and should be deleted.

This is an entirely reasonable change. The wording refers to the work of the public body in question and there is no reference to units.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I regret that I cannot accept the amendment as its effect would be to diminish the protection contained in section 7 against requests involving a substantial and unreasonable interference with the work of a public body as opposed to other work. The use of the term "other work" in this context has the potential to set the threshold much too high.It is correct that a substantial and unreasonable interference with, for example, the work of a division of a Department of State as opposed to the work of the entire Department should constitute grounds for refusal of a request. The threshold for a public body to refuse a request on grounds of interference will continue to be high. The request must still involve a substantial and unreasonable interference before it can be refused and the Information Commissioner has the power to review any decision.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I support my colleague, Senator Higgins, on this issue. The Minister of State refers to requests which cause substantial interference to the work of a Department or unit. In the event that a person makes a request to a public body which then invokes this provision to reject the request on the grounds that it is unreasonable, will the requester be automatically informed that the request was denied because section 7 of the Bill revoked certain powers to access information in the principal Act?The Minister of State is correct that the Information Commissioner did not specifically refer to this provision in his analysis of the Bill as proposed in appendix 1. However, it has come to our attention in respect of the users of the legislation that it can be a stone around their necks when trying to obtain information. We must set a reasonable threshold. Senator Higgins has argued that his amendment would establish the reasonable balance we seek in respect of the rights of the requester to obtain the information he or she wants.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	140	There appears to be merit in the amendment. It is possible that a detailed application made to a relatively small section, in which two or three people are engaged, would substantially disrupt its work if staff required two or three days to deal with the information request. To refuse a request, the Act, as framed, would require a substantial degree of disruption to the whole Department or section, as opposed to requiring the time of two or three people with responsibility for a particular area for a few days.The real problem does not appear to lie with the substance of the change, but with the possibility that it will create scope for substantial abuse. The provision provides a good excuse for a person in a Department to refuse a request. He or she could, for example, decide that his or her time is so valuable he or she cannot afford to take two days out of work to deal with an application. I support the amendment.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The original drafting, which refers solely to disruption of "other work" as opposed to "the work" of a Department or public body, is a little illogical. If the case for rejecting a request is prima facie unreasonable, there is a strong chance a dissatisfied requester would make an appeal to the Information Commissioner. We should move away from the notion that civil servants will be prone to abuse the Act. The legislation is open to public scrutiny and we have an Information Commissioner to whom appeals can be and are made. The assumption that public servants will abuse this provision is not justified.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I support the amendment. A case has not been made to show the current provision is causing disruption.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I agree with Senator Mansergh that the word "other" appears a little incongruous. What is the distinction between the "work" and the "other work" of a Department or public body? The Department should be performing its work per se.The Senator stated the word "unit" is not used in the legislation. When one reads the explanatory memorandum it becomes clear that the intention is to subdivide Departments into sections or units for the purpose of this section.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The explanatory memorandum refers to "the work of a particular unit or section".
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Correct. It also makes the distinction between such work and the general work of the Department or public body as a whole. It states, "The deletion of the word "other" in paragraph (c) is intended to clarify that a substantial and unreasonable interference with work, whether that is the work of a particular unit or section or the work of a body generally, can constitute grounds for refusal of a request.” As other Senators have pointed out, the section narrows down the focus of the definition in the principal Act to small sections in Departments in which, possibly, only two or three people are employed. This constitutes a further attempt to obstruct freedom of information and gives an absolute right to civil servants to refuse a request when they feel it interferes with their work and an incentive to allow the matter to be decided on appeal.

There is no logical defence of this position.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	147	This provision has not been invoked often. However, when it is invoked the public body in question must consult the requester and ask him or her to narrow down the scope of the request before it can be refused. From experience, requesters who make voluminous requests generally agree to narrow down the scope of their requests following consultation with the relevant public body.On the question of absolute rights and the possibility of abuse raised by Senator McDowell, a decision can be appealed to the Information Commissioner.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 7, lines 3 to 7, to delete paragraph  (b).Section 7(b) proposes to insert in section 10(1)(e) of the principal Act, “, or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or from different requesters who, in the opinion of the head, appear to have made the requests acting in concert” after “vexatious”,”. Section 10 of the principal Act states that a head may refuse on administrative grounds to grant requests under section 7, if:(a) the record concerned does not exist or cannot be found after all reasonable steps to ascertain its whereabouts have been taken,(b) the request does not comply with section 7 (1) (b), [We have already discussed paragraph (c)](d) publication of the record is required by law and is intended to be effected not later than 12 weeks after the receipt of the request by the head;(e) the request is, in the opinion of the head, frivolous or vexatious .First, who is the competent authority that will decide whether something is vexatious or frivolous? Second, the wording states: "or forms part of a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from the same requester or from different requesters". Who decides whether the requests are unreasonable?In his report, the Information Commissioner deals with this section in considerable detail. For example, he refers to cases where the number of requests submitted by the requester is very large. He states that, of itself, the fact that a requester has submitted a large number of requests does not indicate that any of them are frivolous or vexatious. He further states that, apart from any other consideration, the question of what constitutes a large number of requests is so subjective as to be of little value in practice in determining whether section 10(1)(e) might apply. In addition, he states that the number of requests received by a public body, both generally or from any one requester, must depend in part on its attitude to the release of information. He gives the example of a public body routinely resisting requests for information which perhaps other public bodies would release administratively and states that it may end up receiving a large number of FOI requests. He goes on to state that it could hardly be correct that its subsequent difficulties in processing these requests should be laid at the door of the requesters who are merely seeking to exercise their statutory rights. In saying this he is not suggesting that the difficulties which the Department has experienced – a case is referred to earlier in the report – with Mr. A.B.W. are of its own making but is merely making the point to show the difficulties in refusing requests solely because the requester has made a large number of requests.Of all the sections we have dealt with so far, this one is wide open to abuse. We are talking about definitions of the terms "vexatious" and "frivolous" and somebody barraging the Department with what appear to be reasonable requests, but which are being made en bloc. There is a major prospect that this section will be used on the basis that the requests are too numerous, they are coming from somebody who has been using the Act too frequently or that the requests are vexatious or frivolous, an area which is wide open to interpretation.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The House has to have an interest in good and efficient administration and it is extraordinary that fellow Senators should create difficulties about excluding frivolous, vexatious and manifestly unreasonable requests from the Bill. Who decides on these requests? In the first instance, it is the body or the persons in the body who receive the request. However, if their decision is unreasonable or there is a pattern of unreasonable decisions, there will be appeals to the Information Commissioner and case law will be established.I am aware from experience that Departments pay attention to decisions of the Information Commissioner and this provides guidelines on how borderline cases are to be decided in the future. We could never pass any legislation on the basis that it could be abused. All legislation can be abused, but there are safeguards in place to prevent that. There are good safeguards in this case. There is an Information Commissioner, who will establish precedence and case law, but it is indefensible for us to be excluding manifestly unreasonable requests. We should concentrate on matters of more substance than that. In terms of the basis of abuse, we can hardly pass legislation on anything if one adopts that assumption.I worked for 25 years in the public service and the notion that public servants will, at the drop of a hat, abuse let-out clauses is wrong. My experience of the people involved, having worked on the specific area of freedom of information, is that they are exceptionally conscientious and want to make the right decisions.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I do not believe we have been given evidence that the original Act is causing problems in this area. The Information Commissioner's report, which we received yesterday, outlines ways in which a persistent requester can be dealt with. No one wants to make some sort of charter for people who make frivolous or vexatious claims, but that is already in the Act. Legislation that has been working well should not be spancelled. People may have good reasons for making repeated requests for information if they have not got everything they want. This is important in view of the fact that there will be changes in that the term "contain" will be included in the Act rather than the phrase "relate to". That is welcome because one might not ask the right question the first time and may get a little more information from the second request.We must remember that this section will greatly affect Members of the Oireachtas, a large number of whom may have to make repeated requests for information. We will not be able to get that information either. I am not just asking about this on behalf of citizens. I want to know if Members of the Oireachtas will be able to get information that we know exists somewhere, even if our initial request is not as close to the mark as whoever is giving the information believes it should be or that it does not contain, for example, something relevant to a particular person. How many requests does one have to make before one is considered to be a repeat requester?I have no doubt that many actions can be taken in this area. For example, if a requester is acting without good cause and fails to agree to the suggestions of the Department as to how the requests should be dealt with, it appears to be easy to move them on. In addition, if they make many requests they can be asked to put them in some sort of priority and be required to agree to whatever system the Department believes should be used to make the request. That is only right because we all agree the other work of a Department has to continue. I am anxious that we are trying to make it more difficult for people in that if they do not decide at the outset the type of information required, they may find that subsequent requests are refused.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The provision in the existing Act about frivolous and vexatious applications was open to serious abuse by people who wanted to frivolously make applications but there is not much evidence that that has happened. The report of the Information Commissioner is fair and comprehensive in coming to that conclusion. To that extent, I endorse what Senator Mansergh said because it is important that those of us on this side of the House record our appreciation of the fact that most public servants are operating the Act in good faith and deal with what is for them a novel situation in the best way possible.My difficulty with the Government's amendment is that it does not add much to the provision already there. It would simply require the person making the decision to define what amounts to a manifestly unreasonable request. That person is already required to decide what is frivolous and vexatious. It will not be any easier to come to a reasonable definition or explanation of what amounts to a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests. The Minister is not adding greatly to the security or certainty which most public servants would crave in operating the section.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	152	While I go along with the Senator to a large extent, frivolous is not precisely the same as vexatious, which in turn is not necessarily precisely the same as manifestly unreasonable. Any public servant would be very slow to find any FOI requests from Senator Henry or any other Member of the Oireachtas to be manifestly unreasonable. One can turn the argument around. If it is accepted without contradiction that it is acceptable to exclude requests that are frivolous and vexatious, then I do not see the problem in also including manifestly unreasonable as all three are roughly on the same level.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	153	In his original contribution, while defending the public service, having come from such a background himself, Senator Mansergh said in his general experience the public service has operated the spirit of the Act almost to the letter. He stated there have been very few occasions on which it was open to abuse as such. The Information Commissioner's report gives a classic example of what can occur. I mentioned earlier the case of Mr. ABK and the Eastern Health Board. This relates directly to section 10(1)(e), which is the subject of these amendments. The report states:The relevance of section 10(1)(e) was one of the issues considered by me in this case. The requester had sought access to records relating to himself, his former partner and his daughter. The Eastern Health Board (EHB) refused the request on the basis that all relevant information had already been made available to the requester by means of discovery in earlier court proceedings and that therefore the request was frivolous and vexatious within the meaning of section 10(1)(e).I agree with Senator Mansergh in pointing out the difference in the meaning of words. When asked for his decision on appeal the Information Commissioner said: "In my review decision I found that the request could not be considered to be frivolous." This is a blatant example of the health board misinterpreting this and deliberately deciding the person was not entitled to the record on the basis that the request was both frivolous and vexatious. While the commissioner does not deal with the vexatious aspect, he states it could not be considered frivolous. He goes on to state: "However, I accepted that Mr. ABK's [the plaintiff's] purpose in making the request was to advance his case and, therefore, the request could not be said to be vexatious."I have two problems with this. I have problems with the interpretation of frivolous and vexatious, and in the worst case scenario at least the existing Act should stand as it is without adding this other complicated addendum to it. That is why I tabled my amendment that the Government's proposal should be deleted.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	154	It should be acknowledged that public bodies, civil servants and public servants can make wrong decisions or decisions that are found to be erroneous by the Information Commissioner without this being blatant, deliberate or in bad faith. We have no evidence from the commissioner's report that the Eastern Health Board was acting in bad faith and we should not assume that.Regardless of the wording used, from time to time mistakes will be made and that is why the commissioner is there. That is not an argument for not including "manifestly unreasonable".
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I agree with Senator Mansergh. I have some experience working these things, both as an official and as an ombudsman. There are vexatious complainants just as there are vexatious litigants from whom the courts occasionally have to refuse to accept actions. It is an exercise in judgment. The trouble is that requests might be off the wall in 98 cases, but the next request might not be so. Like Senator Mansergh, I do not believe any evidence has been produced from anybody's experience of public servants having unduly used this.There needs to be some protection against people simply going on fishing expeditions and inordinate cost is a sufficiently reasonable response to these. People who are really interested and have boned up on the subject will know the questions they want to ask and these are generally answered. This section does not seem to limit the scope of the original Act in any way. I would be inclined to let it go.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I find Senator Maurice Hayes's remarks very interesting. They point to the difficulty that it would be possible for someone to make 98 unreasonable requests but the one on which he is finally refused under this section is reasonable. It would be possible to surmount this by simply substituting the word "and" for "or" in that section so that it would be frivolous, vexatious and part of a pattern of unreasonable requests.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I will not accept this amendment as it would mean that a clear pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests from a single requester or a group of requesters acting in concert could not constitute grounds for refusal. The need for such protection was adequately demonstrated by the Minister for Finance in his speech to the House on Second Stage, when he drew attention to the example of a requester who made scores of requests to a single public body within the 18 months of the Act coming into force. These requests alone were estimated to have cost the body concerned in excess of €127,000. Each request from that requester had to be considered as a totally new request and there was no basis for dealing with the reality by linking those requests.As already stated, the Information Commissioner has oversight and he will look at the meaning of frivolous or vexatious by reference to the Oxford English Dictionary. The commissioner has already stated that repeated requests for the same information with the intention of causing obstruction to the body in its day-to-day operations are vexatious. The central policy unit of the Department of Finance will give guidelines to public bodies on the use of this provision, as it does on various issues on the correct application of the Act.We have no problem with the example cited by Senator Higgins. If public bodies misuse the provision of the Act it is right for the Information Commissioner to point this out. That is his role and this will not change.

In page 7, paragraph (c), line 10, after “requester” to insert “made within the previous 12 months”.This is a minor amendment that seeks to ensure a person cannot be refused an application on the grounds that he or she previously failed to pay a fee. I concede that it is reasonable to take into account the fact that a person did not pay a previous fee, but there should be a cut-off point.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	160	It relates to paragraph (f) of the original section.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Only the failure to pay a fee in the past 12 months should be taken into account when refusing an application, rather than trawling through someone's record in the distant past.In the early months of the operation of the Act, I applied to the Department of Finance for records concerning regionalisation. I received a demand for a considerable sum of money from a section of the Department. I approached the section again and asked if it felt it was appropriate for me to apply to the Department of Finance for money so that I could pay it back to the Department of Finance to allow me to do my job. In any event the fee was waived, but no doubt it blots my copybook and, in theory, I could be refused a request. It is reasonable to take someone's immediate record in failing to pay a fee into account, but there should also be a cut-off point.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	163	This is an amendment the Minister of State can accept without phoning Cheltenham.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I would prefer if remarks of that nature were not made. They are very amusing, but they have no relevance at all and are becoming tiresome.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	165	We make them to oblige the Acting Chairman to defend the Minister and Minister of State, time and again.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	166	This is a practical amendment that would enhance the Bill because otherwise people who made requests ten years earlier will be covered by the amended Act. This is an innocuous addition.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	167	There was disagreement about the term "requester". There is no definition of the word in the principal Act or the amending legislation. Could it be a corporate body? A corporate body might be a frequent requester and then an individual from that body would attempt to find information about a different issue or from a different source. Would that person be regarded as being the same requester as the corporate body?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I am opposed to this amendment. There are no grounds for restricting to 12 months the period for which a public body could invoke the provision whereby a failure to pay a fee properly charged under FOI can constitute grounds for refusal of a request. This would serve to restrict unduly a public body when taking unreasonable behaviour into account.The payment of a fee is a requirement under the Freedom of Information Act and it is only correct that a previous failure to pay a fee should constitute grounds for refusal of a request, regardless of when that failure occurred. The fee of £127,000 incurred by one person was mentioned. The body involved reduced the fee to €600 and the individual even appealed that. If a person ran up such a fee and after 12 months and one day decided to submit a request, that fee and the cost involved would be the responsibility of the body. He could then do the same again a year later.In Australia, a minimum of €1,800 is charged for a request. In addition, a person can go to the Information Commissioner for a review if he or she is not happy with the decision made by the public body.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	169	What about the requester? The NUJ made the point that there must be definition of this term. If a reporter from the Irish Independent had not paid a fee for a previous request, or was disputing a fee, this section could technically block a request from a reporter on a sister publication, in respect of completely separate records, until the original fee is paid. Is the requester an individual or could it include a newspaper or group of newspapers?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am not trying to be vexatious or frivolous, but it is profoundly depressing for us and for the Minister of State, because he is perfectly competent, to know that we are going through this and he is not in a position to take even an amendment as minor as that before us. I sympathise with him and Senator Mansergh because some of these issues are so minor that if the Minister of State was dealing with a Bill from his own Department he would accept them.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	172	According to the 1997 Act, the requester is the person who makes a request under section 7. It is an individual, not a group. It should also be borne in mind that the public body can waive fees if it deems the circumstances suitable.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	173	As I understand it, this section deals with requests where some information is disclosed and part of it is withheld in circumstances where it is neither confirmed nor denied that the latter is the case. It would seem to make matters more difficult in circumstances where part of the information is being disclosed. Is the requester also told there may or may not be additional information which is not being given? If not, it is clearly not possible to apply the public interest test to the information, the very existence of which is not being disclosed.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	174	With regard to the section, the purpose of this technical consequential amendment is to ensure that, where access is granted to parts of records and there is a refusal to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of a record under the provisions of sections 19, 20 or 21 of the Bill, public bodies are not obliged to disclose the existence or non-existence of a record in a notification to a request under section 8(1) of the principal Act.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	175	If I apply for a record and am given part of it, will I be told there may or may not be material which I have not been given? Anybody obtaining records would assume they are getting the full record unless some indication is given that there may or may not be other records which are being refused. Obviously, if one gets something and does not know there is something else, one is not in a position to appeal the refusal of the other information.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	176	In the case of the National Archives, documents are released with sections blacked out and, therefore, it is quite clear there are items missing. I assume, in the case of a Government record being given out, other than re-typing and giving it in that form, it must be obvious from the deletions or blacking out that it is incomplete.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	177	That would be the case where one is clearly being refused part of the records, but what we are dealing with in this regard is a situation where one is not being clearly refused part of the records, where, in respect of part of the records, there is a neither confirm nor deny provision in place. Accordingly, there would not be anything as clear-cut as a blacking out of some information.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Yes.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I cannot really refuse that. However, although it may sound somewhat complicated, somebody being given or refused information will assume, unless informed otherwise, that this is all the information available. What I really need to know is whether there is, potentially, another section of information the existence of which will not be disclosed.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	182	A person might sometimes request information which he or she knows to exist but which cannot be disclosed for certain reasons. It is a very technical area and I suggest it would be better if the Senator went through it with the Department officials.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I had asked the question.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I am aware of that. I ask the Chair to do me the service of slowing down so that I can keep up. Nonetheless, I commend the Acting Chairman for his enthusiasm and expediency.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Just to be clear, I was not going all that fast. There are many sections in the Bill and I have put the questions clearly.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I am fully aware of that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	193	On which section does the Senator wish to speak?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	195	We have already agreed section 9.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Yes, we did. I asked the question very clearly on section 9 and it was agreed. However, I will be flexible on this occasion.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Acting Chairman is kind. However, I am not hugely exercised by section 9 in any event. I merely wish to ask the Minister of State whether there is any check or if any guidelines are offered in relation to the persons to be notified in circumstances where a withdrawal action takes place. Is that covered by guidelines or is it entirely within the discretion of the person making the decision?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Section 9 amends section 14 of the principal Act by the inclusion of the amendment, consequential to the amendments proposed in sections 19, 20 and 21. Also, subsection (viii) is being substituted. The effect is to require a head to notify any person whom he or she considers relevant that an application of section 14 of the principal Act has been withdrawn. Guidelines will be issued by the CPU.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Senator O'Meara has indicated her opposition to this section.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I will seek to articulate Senator O'Meara's opposition to the section. The difficulty relates exclusively to the fact that it is now open to the Department of Finance, as the responsible Department, to issue the section 15 manual purely by electronic means. While I am in favour of Government, in so far as is possible, moving to electronic means, we have to be realistic in recognising that, at least for now, many people still do not have access to the Internet or to PCs. Accordingly, it will not be possible, at least for the next number of years, to access the information if it is only published by electronic means. I assume that is being done for administrative reasons.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	202	There will be a hard copy.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	203	In that case, we can shorten the debate considerably. If it is intended to continue to publish the information manual concerned in hard copy for the next few years, I am happy to withdraw opposition to this particular section. It may well be reasonable in ten years to rely on electronic means only, but for now that is somewhat ambitious.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	204	In response to the Senator's comment on cutting the debate short, a hard copy will be available on request to anybody seeking it. I should add that these amendments have been recommended by the Information Commissioner.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 8, lines 40 to 43 and in page 9, lines 1 to 18, to delete paragraph (a).I am out of the traps at last. It is unfortunate that we have to table amendments at all. The main thrust of the Bill was to be that the time limit for disclosure of Government papers would be extended from five to ten years. I would have no difficulty with that if, for the workings of Government, it is found easier to put in place a longer period, having regard to the fact that many people involved in making decisions five years ago are probably still in power. The real difficulty is that we now seem to have extended the definition of Government to virtually any two or three people who are gathered together in the name of the Government, no matter how vaguely connected. Consequently, whatever they may discuss will remain undisclosed for ten years and freedom of information will not apply to quite important documents which may relate to Government decisions. That extension is far too great and, consequently, we have put down this and subsequent amendments.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	206	This amendment reflects the fact that in recent years much Government work is carried on in Government sub-committees and much of the ground is cleared by those sub-committees. In the case of particular problems relating to a Government decision, one could delegate a group of three or four very senior officials, which, depending on the question, might or might not include an adviser, to look at the matter and report back to a Minister. Obviously it is desirable that all that deliberative process, much of which of course would be oral, should also be done in writing because anything one does in writing is inevitably more systematic and also it is reviewable in a way that merely oral exchanges are not. We are talking about the deliberative process which is all part of the whole. These days it is entirely artificial to treat Government sub-committees as being totally different and apart from Government.I am glad to say we have not moved in the direction of, say, the British Government, where I gather Cabinet meetings last on average only half an hour and literally everything is done in sub-committees. There are still Cabinet meetings here. They are not as long as in the days when Garrett FitzGerald was Taoiseach, when they lasted far into the night, but there are Cabinet meetings which take two or three hours and occasionally all day.Almost always, on any difficult question before Cabinet, the relevant Ministers, with or without officials, are assembled. There may be papers which are being worked on. These are all part of the one deliberative process. It is entirely artificial to separate them and put only a minimal definition on what is involved, that is, literally only the paper that goes before Cabinet. Therefore I can see the logic of these changes. It corresponds accurately to the reality of modern Government.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	207	May I point out to Senator Mansergh that, according to the definition in the Bill:"‘officials' means two or more of the following:(a) a person holding a position in the Civil Service of the Government or the Civil Service of the State;”.Nothing here says anything about senior officials. It could be anyone. It continues:"(b) a special adviser within the meaning of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995;(c) a person who is a member of such other (if any) classes of person as may be prescribed.”.Therefore it is not the sort of person Senator Mansergh is suggesting. It can be anyone, according to this section.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Senator Henry, could you advise me as to where you are quoting? I am looking at section 12.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Am I correct in saying that you are not dealing with this amendment?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Sorry, but Senator Mansergh spoke about the officials. That is why I thought I had better clarify what I was talking about. I am not the one who started talking about them. It would be a good idea if we were all talking about the same matters at the same time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	218	We are talking, not about the lines to which you refer but about the deletion of paragraph (a) and the substitution of the following paragraph:"(aa) consists of a communication–(i) between two or more members of the Government relating to a matter that is under consideration by the Government or is proposed to be submitted to the Government, or(ii) between two or more such members who form, or form part of, a group of such members to which a matter has been delegated by the Government for consideration by the group and the communication relates to that matter,".

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I understand that but, with respect, Senator Henry's quotations were not related specifically to the amendment. This is very difficult and complex, but we are dealing specifically with this amendment. I am not admonishing anybody. I am pointing out to the House what we are dealing with.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	221	We are always being told in other legislation that we are not to put in "shall" and we must have "may", and here the Minister is doing the opposite.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I will speak specifically to the amendment, although obviously it sits in the heart of a section which, together with the following section, forms the core of the Bill. These two sections really are the core of the Bill presented by Government and they go a long way to drawing down the veil of secrecy over the way in which Government operates. They make it almost impossible to find out what discussion is going on between various sections of Government – Ministers, Departments, Civil Service or whatever – about what is currently under discussion, and indeed for some time afterwards. It is with this, I suppose, that we are primarily concerned in this amendment.It seems to me that there are three different parts of paragraph (a) which are cause for considerable concern. First, there is the substitution of “shall refuse” for “may refuse”. Section 19 of the 1997 Act allows the Secretary General of a Department, at his discretion, to release all the records that are dealt with in that section, that is, records relating to decisions of Government and meetings of Government, if he decides that it is in the public interest to do so. To the best of my knowledge, Secretaries General or heads of Department, the people who make these decisions, have rarely, if ever, decided that information of that kind is to be made available. It seems to me, even in those circumstances, that it is still reasonable to allow the discretion to lie with the Secretary General to disclose such information if it is in the public interest.I wonder why Government finds it necessary to be as directive as it clearly is by making it mandatory on a Secretary General to refuse the availability of that information, even in circumstances where it might be in the public interest. For example, I am not at all clear about how stands the public interest test in the latter part of section 19, if we are making it mandatory on the Secretary General to refuse the information in the first instance. It seems to me that the public interest test therefore becomes literally redundant.The second part of the amendment proposed by Senator Henry is, as I see it, the major shift from the word "solely" to "primarily". The 1997 Act was drawn up fairly tightly. It was drawn up specifically to limit the number of records which could claim the protection of constitutional privilege so that it would not be possible for civil servants, by preparing stuff largely, primarily or perhaps to go to Government, to say that this is a record of Government which will not be available now or ever – or at least not for five years or what is now likely to be ten years.The use of the word "solely" in the 1997 Act was deliberate. It was intended to limit the discretion which deciding officers would have. It was intended to ensure that the maximum possible level of information would become available in the public interest. It was intended specifically to give a stimulus to public debate and to put as much information in the public domain as possible within the confines, which we all acknowledge, of constitutional collective responsibility and so on.A shift from saying "solely" to "primarily", that is to say, records created primarily for Government, allows, in my view, far too much discretion to people who are making decisions effectively to hide information. There is no requirement that the information should come to Government. It could have been drawn up or formulated with some broad notion that it is simply a policy option which might or might never end up at the Cabinet table.If we are trying to make some sense of this and the Government is determined to go down this road, we should at least insist that the information or records required have actually come before Government, rather than there being some vague possibility of their having done so or doing so in the future. If we do not try to tighten these provisions in some way, a coach and four can be driven through the Act in so far as it relates to policy making decisions.Paragraph (aa) contains the new definition of communication between two members of Government or a sub-group of Government. It seems that the protection offered by this new definition will cease once the deliberative process is over. The original section 19 states that “[a] head may refuse to grant a request . if the record concerned . has been, or is proposed to be, submitted to the Government”. The reference to communication between Ministers does not state “has been” but is phrased entirely in the present tense. That a communication between, say, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, may have been intended to be submitted to Government in the past and was not is no longer relevant. I would like confirmation from the Minister of State's officials that my understanding of this is correct: once the deliberative process is over, communications of this kind between Ministers should be available and are not caught by the ten year rule set out in later amendments.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I support Senator Henry's amendment on the basis of both her arguments and those of Senator McDowell. Looking at the original Bill one can see that "[a] head may refuse to grant a request under section 7” if certain conditions apply. Now we are taking away any discretion on the part of the head of a Department of the assigned person to make a decision to release information. Does that not show an enormous lack of faith in the judgment of their fellow heads of Department by those who drafted this legislation, the so-called expert group? They cannot even allow them the discretion of deciding whether, in extremis, such a record could be released under the terms of the 1997 Act. We all know that in the past this discretion was exercised stringently and only in the most extreme circumstances. Even that possibility has now been withdrawn. Arguments have been made that we are bringing down an information iron curtain. This is an example of just how restrictive this legislation is.The Bill states, "(aa) consists of a communication . between two or more members of the Government”. Time and again during the Second Stage deliberations we made the argument that one of the things that had turned people off politics was the veil of secrecy that had enveloped decision making in government. We need to open up government, make things more open and transparent, allow people to become greater stakeholders in what is going on and shine a light into the portals of decision making. Even if there are differences of opinion on what should be done, so what? They should also be put into the public domain. No two people think alike, nor do any two Ministers or sets of advisers on every single issue. If there are differences, we should let them be exposed in order that we may show how decisions are arrived at. They come from people with divergent views but ultimately a consensus is reached, collectively, on behalf of the Government. This section is guaranteed to diminish further people's confidence in how decisions are arrived at. At a time in which we should be opening up the process it is further restricting access to information.I sat at the Cabinet table as Government Chief Whip for the better part of two and a half years. A system of was in vogue at the time that came in for a lot of criticism – the system of programme managers. When Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party went into government back in the early 1990s, I was one of the strongest critics of the system. However, having seen it operate at close quarters, I can now say that it was very useful. It enabled Ministers to have an outside, objective view, facilitated decisions on a one-to-one basis between programme managers and cut down on the kind of Cabinet meetings to which Senator Mansergh referred: the long, deliberative meetings at which everything was thrashed out at the table. I can say without divulging anything that I never saw, within the Cabinet of 1994 to 1997, a division on any item or memorandum before it.There were differences between programme managers, of which we were well aware. I cannot see the reason the initial differences between programme managers on decisions should not be put in the public domain. A consensus was arrived at, compromises were sought and finally a decision was brought before Cabinet with which everybody was happy. I am at a loss to know the reason this section has been inserted. It is restrictive and guaranteed to diminish people's confidence in the government process. If there is a difference of opinion between decision makers, either at advisory or Cabinet level, there is no reason it cannot be made public. A considerable public interest would be served by so doing.I fully support the view on the replacement of the word "primarily" with "solely". This is another example of the iron curtain. If there is any possibility whatsoever that the matter under discussion or the information being sought will arrive some day at the Cabinet table, it is prevented from becoming public. "Solely" means that it is specifically designed for Government. "Primarily" means that it may at some stage arrive at Government but there is no guarantee it will do so. It is a further example of the determination of those drafting this report, which has been bought lock, stock and barrel by the Government, to restrict access to information even further.

The problem with the word "may" as opposed to "shall", although I accept that it would prevent the release of information only rarely, is that it implies an element of discretion: it opens up the possibility of people reaching different decisions on similar cases. It is about clarity and consistency of practice in government.I agree with the points made by Senator Higgins about how government has become more complex, with pre-discussion of issues and differences. The essence of this Bill, for the most part, is consistent with freedom of information also having freedom of deliberation. The difficulty is that if everything right up to the discussion at Government level went out to the media, differences would be blown up. It is entirely natural to have differences between a Minister for Finance and any other Minister, the Minister for Health and Children being the most current example, but it could be made out to be a deep, personalised rift. Differences such as this are absolutely normal.At the committee tomorrow we will hear distinguished public servants who have an interest in good government speak about whether there should be a space in which people are free to discuss and debate without differences being distorted or exaggerated. This puts an onus on them because, if all this is going to become public immediately, it may distort behaviour as people believe they have to cover themselves vis-à-vis one constituency or another.Senator Henry made some comments about the first few lines of page 28. In practice the pre-discussions of Government decisions involve senior officials and occasionally non-senior ranking experts in a particular field. This is not a blanket definition that covers everyone, down to the most junior entrant to the Civil Service.The word "solely" is too restrictive. This is a question of practicality. The amendments are informed by the experience of operating the Act over a four or five year period and clearly the word "solely" is too restrictive. The notion that the public service and the Government want to drive a coach and four through the legislation is untrue. There are clear safeguards against the abuse of the legislation. No one can muzzle the Information Commissiner or stop him making strong comments about refusals. I do not see the dangers because there are safeguards built in.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The provisions which the amendment would delete reflect the Government's considered view of the limited changes necessary to the protections available for Cabinet records to ensure effective government, consistent with the principles underlined in the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The relevant provisions also reflect the Government's considered view of the additional protection necessary to ensure the exercise of collective ministerial responsibility is not adversely affected by the operation of certain provisions of the Act. During the deliberative process of an issue by a Government it is essential that members of the Government can communicate with one another in an open and frank manner. These communications should be capable of being carried out on a completely confidential basis. Protection for inter-ministerial communications is a feature of the FOI legislation in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.In reply to Senator McDowell's question, after the deliberative process is over, records are protected under the ten year rule.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I was looking to distinguish between the two. The way paragraph (aa) is drafted refers to communication between two members of the Government relating to a matter under consideration or proposed to be submitted to Government. If I apply now for correspondence between Ministers in respect of a decision made by a Government six months ago, that exemption will not save those records from disclosure. Perhaps I should not point this out to the Minister of State but it seems that as soon as the decision is taken, those records will be available and will not be caught by the ten year rule.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	229	That is covered under subsection (c) in lines 35 to 39.The provisions also reflect the expert opinion and experience of the five Secretaries General who conducted the review of the operation of provisions of the FOI Act impacting on sensitive areas of government. I will not accept the amendments as their effect would be to remove provisions which, as I have said, are based on the opinion of the Government and the five Secretaries General.Section 12 also provides for a mandatory exemption for all Government records covered in section 19 (1) of the principal Act by substituting the words "shall refuse" with the words "may refuse" in subsection (1). This is based on the recommendations of the high level group. A mandatory refusal of such requests will clarify the de facto position whereby such records are rarely, if ever, released in response to an FOI request. It also amends section 19 of the principal Act, substituting the word “primarily” for the word “solely” in paragraph (c) of subsection (1). This amendment will allow for advice, created for the primary purpose of Government business, to be protected. The word “solely”, in this context, can work to preclude records also created for incidental purposes and is considered overly restrictive.I do not agree with Senator Higgins's analysis that the ten year rule would be equivalent to an iron curtain being brought down over decisions.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	230	No. I referred to the insertion of the word "shall" for the word "may", which does not give any discretion to senior public servants to make a decision, even in the rarest of circumstances, to release records.

This would go against the general thrust of the Bill and the report of the group of Secretaries General which has clearly identified the need for enhanced protection in this area.

In page 9, line 32, to delete "10 years" and substitute "6 years".This amendment is proposed in the context of the Bill which the Labour Party introduced to the Lower House last night. It seeks to give the Government a cooling-off period within which it could discuss the impact of this provision. The Dáil is considering that Bill on which it will make a decision later today. We are looking to offer the Government an opportunity to get off the hook and take time out to consider it.This Bill is being rushed through this month because the Government feels obliged to meet the April deadline, presumably because, once the five years are up, there will be an avalanche of requests to find out what the Government was doing this time five years ago. In order to meet the concerns of Government, we considered we would amend the existing Act by providing a full year wherein we could take a more serious look at the Bill and the operation of the 1997 Freedom of Information Act.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	238	While there is a number of significant amendments, this one has been widely publicised by the Government. I have heard some poorly informed commentators say this Bill is only about extending the five year Cabinet secrecy rule to ten years and wondering what all the fuss is about. If it was only this issue, we would not get so worked up. In a discussion on this matter on radio this morning it was pointed out that the five year rule was liberal when compared to the rule in other jurisdictions; it was said almost as if Ireland should be entirely consistent with other regimes. While it may be liberal, it is in the context of the spirit of the 1997 legislation which sought to create a real balance between the right of citizens to have access to information, particularly about how Government decisions are made, and the necessity of Government to maintain a level of secrecy from time to time.It was the intention of those who framed the legislation that a five year rule would apply to Cabinet memoranda. The Bill before us proposes to increase this to ten years. It is before us because the Government has been re-elected. Within it there is clearly a view that the release of Cabinet memoranda relating to decisions made in 1998 could be a source of embarrassment. This is the main reason the legislation is before us. The Taoiseach does not want information on Government decisions from 1998 to be available under the Freedom of Information Act and accessible to public representatives, journalists or members of the public. It is worth looking back on the thinking behind the intentions of Government of the day regarding this provision and worth remembering the Oireachtas agreed this legislation, including the five year rule, at the time. A different view is now taken.This amendment seeks to reduce the ten year limit to six years. It is a reasonable amendment which is consistent with the Private Members' Bill the Labour Party has published. It would give the Government one year to consult, not only on this rule, but also on what it perceives to be a need to review the legislation. This would be reasonable considering the report of the Information Commissioner, the work of the Joint committee on Finance and the Public Service which is to commence tomorrow, and the strong interest of the public in the matter as indicated by the letters pages in the national press. Having discussed this in a public way the Government could then attempt to achieve an agreed position about extending the rule to seven or more years. While there may be circumstances in which this might be necessary, it should include wide consultation and, if possible, consensus. It is not possible to reach consensus when legislation is being rushed through in this manner.No time has been given for consideration or real discussion. It is not enough to hear the views of experts on national radio in the morning – one should hear the views of experts in proper forums and have time to consider them and to examine the legislation. We should have time to examine the operation of the Act and listen to the reaction of users with a view to reflecting those views in new legislation. That is clearly not the intention of the Government. It is not too late for it to take heed of the views of the Opposition. Accepting this amendment and dropping all the rest would give breathing space and the time necessary to institute a proper review. Amendments could then be made to this important legislation.I have mentioned the report of the Information Commissioner. Considering there is only a little time left in this debate I wish to signal the intention of the Labour Party to table amendments on Report Stage relating largely to appendix 2 of the commissioner's report. In other words, it will be our intention to put down amendments in relation not only to the sections we have discussed so far, but also to sections 15 to 18, inclusive, 22, 23, 26, 29, 32 to 35, inclusive, 37, 42, 43 and 46 and to insert a potential new provision. I wish to signal that now in case there is a debate, as it were, on procedure with regard to Report Stage amendments. That is our intention.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The amendment is based on the Labour Party Private Members' Bill, which is a clever and ingenious parliamentary device such as one might expect from the leader of that party. However, it concedes the principle that five years is too short. Ten years will still be at the liberal end of the spectrum with regard to international practice.I expressed the view on Second Stage that ten years is enough and if Fianna Fáil was to be returned to Government, I would not welcome any effort to reopen it. I am not, of course, presuming there would be such an effort. The passage of ten years, regardless of who is in Government – it may even be the same people – ought to be possible without interfering with the freedom of deliberation. Freedom of deliberation in Government, consistent with freedom of information, is at the heart of this legislation, along with creating the necessary space to make reasoned decisions.Despite the fuss and furore about the legislation, there is little serious challenge to the change from five to ten years. The argument is about the logical consequences of doing that and what it should cover. I readily concede that five years ago people on all sides of both Houses were, perhaps, a little too enthusiastic. However, we have had five years experience to gauge what is and is not practicable. Ten years is eminently sensible. The commissioner does not say a word about this issue in either section of his report. It is a reasonable change, the purpose of which is to balance the need for good Government and freedom of deliberation within the Government with the right to freedom of information, which I also support, for the public and the media.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I wish to take up a point made by Senator O'Meara, who served as a valued and valuable adviser to the then Minister of State, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald. I was served in Cabinet for a number of years. The Senator said it was her belief that the reason for changing from five to ten years was to ensure that decisions taken in 1998 by the Cabinet would not now see the light of day. Given that I was a Cabinet Minister for those five years, I wish to make it clear that it is widely agreed, even if it is not often said, that this measure is not at all, to quote one of the words used this morning, outrageous. In fact, the commissioner has not commented on it. In the context of other countries, ten years is relatively early.I cannot let the debate proceed without stating clearly that I was a member of the Cabinet for those five years and never missed a Cabinet meeting in that period. I am not seeking a good attendance mark, but simply explaining my position. The Senator seems to presume that dark events occurred because she said that events that have happened since 1998 cannot be judged in the light of day. That is incorrect. I speak not just for myself but for the general Cabinet. That should be on the record.

The Leader said that my remarks were incorrect. Perhaps she would clarify that. Are they technically incorrect or is it her view that what I am saying is not the case? She would say that she would be happy for any decision she made as Minister or any decision the Cabinet made while she was Minister to come out. I would be delighted if that is what she means. Perhaps she would clarify that. If that is the case, what is the problem with five or six years?

I never suggested that. If she took it up the wrong way, I apologise. I said that this measure was about the Taoiseach exercising control over decisions which were made in 1998 and which he does not want to be revealed. There is no other suggestion. I wonder what is causing the sensitivity. There is no suggestion in the opinion I offered that anything the Leader did as Minister was improper or incorrect in any way.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I do not wish to intrude on private grief or private quarrels. If I do, I apologise in advance. I have no difficulty with this part of the Bill, but I have enormous problems with the later part, which we will discuss later. Five years is too short. The proper limit is a matter for discussion. Ten years does not appear to be extravagant. I differ from the conclusion drawn by Senator O'Meara. It is not necessarily a desire to cover up what happened five years ago, but to preserve the vitality and the integrity of the discussions that take place.It is hugely important that people engaged in that argument feel free to do so. I would be more enthusiastic in propounding that view if some of the Ministers who are so anxious for the ten years limit were not themselves leaking information when it suits them.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	252	That is an eccentric remark.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Yes, I am an eccentric person and I am entitled to be so. Of course, I am drawing on experience from elsewhere, as one would know, rather than in this jurisdiction.Being what it is, I do not think human nature is likely to change. A serious point that would arise in any business or grouping is that people must be free to have discussions. As to how long the record of such discussions should remain inaccessible under the freedom of information legislation, I think the lifetime of two Governments, or something of that order, would be a safe period. There is a real danger of developing a culture of reticence whereby people will not say what they otherwise might or should say and where people will not commit anything to paper.I recall going into an American Government office shortly after the freedom of information law had been enacted there and I asked an official how he dealt with personal files and other such details under the new legislation. He held up a sheet of yellow sticky pads and said, "That's the way we do it and we scrub them all off when the files have to go anywhere". That attitude is also wrong, however, so we must strike a balance. The balance being struck in the Bill is not all that bad.While we have not come to it yet, I have severe difficulties with the next part of the section because the line is being drawn too widely about what might constitute Government business. On the narrower point, however, I think the ten year period is not unreasonable.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I will be brief because in the time left at our disposal it is obvious that we will be hard pressed to reach some of the other essential parts of the Bill.I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that people have a certain right to discuss their business in confidence, but for how long should the veil of secrecy prevail? We have to get the balance right. Senator Mansergh said that the Labour Party's amendment concedes the principle that five years is too short. It recognises the fact that the Government has a difficulty, but it does provide a breathing space of one year. It is a sensible amendment which provides the Government with an escape hatch. Certain members of the Government – perhaps the Government as a whole – might think ten years is too long a period within which to keep records totally under wraps. We should support the amendment.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I agree with Senator Higgins's assessment. Effectively, for the first time in three days, the Government side is right about an argument. I happen to agree with what Senator Mansergh is saying. I said the same thing in 1997 when I considered that five years was too short a period and I still believe that to be the case. I support the amendment for the reasons given by Senator O'Meara, namely, that it gives a year to allow the Government to make a proper assessment without having to open up confidential records. This just means that we will return to it in a year. As many speakers and I said on Second Stage, the period should be a minimum of ten years. I am uncomfortable, however, in dealing with an aspect of the Bill about which Fianna Fáil and the Government side of the House generally are comfortable. I would like to have a vote on this amendment before moving on to the matters about which the Government side is excruciatingly embarrassed.In yesterday's debate, the Minister of State quoted an authority – a woman whose name I do not recall – in support of some argument. Perhaps he could clarify who that person was.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I did not hear "Morning Ireland" so I cannot comment on that.I will be opposing the amendment. The Government is satisfied that commencement of the release of Cabinet records after five years would prevent the articulation of views by Ministers in memoranda and other records coming to Government. This would be detrimental to a process which relies on Ministers freely articulating views prior to their submission to Cabinet so that there is the maximum opportunity to forge a consensus. I do not believe that a one year extension from five to six years would serve to address these concerns in any meaningful way. The Government has taken the considered view that a ten-year period of protection is necessary so that Ministers can continue to have confidence that views given by them in memoranda will be sufficiently protected. A period of ten years, which is still very short by international standards, represents a reasonable balance between the requirements of openness and transparency and the need to ensure that the processes of Cabinet function effectively.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	260	On a procedural point, as there are still quite a number of amendments to be dealt with, can amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 12 in my name, which all deal with the role of the Attorney General, be taken as a group in order to expedite matters?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	261	They can if the Members agree to the grouping of them. Is that agreed? Agreed. Therefore, amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 12 will be taken together by agreement.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 9, line 34 after "or" to insert "the Attorney General certifies in writing that the said decision is on a matter of vital national importance in that it relates to an issue of public health or safety, national security or the vital economic interests of the State and upon the Attorney General so certifying a period of 10 years shall be required before subsection (1) shall apply, or".These amendments have the same purpose, which is to limit the impact of the extension from five to ten years to those decisions the Attorney General is willing to certify as vital to the national interest. I have cast the net quite wide regarding areas the Attorney General could define in that way. We are saying the five-year rule should apply in normal circumstances, but that, in extreme circumstances where the national interest is determined by the Attorney General as being central to the release of these records, he or she would have to certify those decisions. The areas are the same in the three amendments and if the Attorney General certifies the decisions they will be kept under wraps for ten years. That is, if the Attorney General certifies in writing that the said decision is on a matter of vital national importance in that it relates to an issue of public health or safety, national security or the vital economic interests of the State, upon the Attorney General so certifying, a period of ten years shall be required before subsection (1) shall apply.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I second the amendment. The argument is that the Attorney General should be the deciding officer when it comes to determining what information should be published in the national interest.The Attorney General is in a unique position in Cabinet. If not a Deputy, he or she does not speak publicly on issues, although the previous holder of the office did so. The Attorney General has a knowledge of all Departments because he or she is not only legal adviser to the Taoiseach but also to the Cabinet. That gives him or her the independence and knowledge of Departments to be able to make this call. Everyone understands and accepts that it is important that some documents, particularly those relating to Northern Ireland and other matters of national security, should not be published. There is merit in asking the Attorney General, who is legal adviser to the Government on most issues, to take this position and Senator Higgins's amendment is constructive in that it concedes on the ten-year rule for areas of national interest. The suggestion has merit.

It is artificial to pick out particular areas which would require judgment; a simple rule would cover the entire business of Government. The ten-year period is reasonable and is liberal by international standards. We should not divide Government business into different categories. The Attorney General has an enormous amount of work to do and I would not add to it in this way.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I oppose amendment No. 8, which would qualify the protection that is available to all Cabinet records in a way that is not applicable under the existing Act. I am satisfied that the potential for the release of such records to undermine collective ministerial responsibility is not limited to the categories set out in the amendment. It is notable that the framers of the original Act did not restrict the protection available for Government records in this way, nor would one find much support for such restrictions in FOI legislation overseas.Regarding amendment No. 9, the group of Secretaries General argued cogently for the need to protect ministerial communications relevant to ongoing or pending Cabinet deliberations. The potential for the release of such records to undermine collective ministerial responsibility is not limited to the categories set out in the amendment, which I also oppose.I also oppose amendment No. 12 as the Government is satisfied with the continuing need to protect Cabinet records as a class, including records of committees established to support Cabinet decision-making. The potential for the release of such records to undermine collective ministerial responsibility is not limited to the categories set out in the amendment.The Attorney General's role is to give advice to the Government on a wide range of complex legal issues. It is not appropriate that he or she would have a certifying role regarding freedom of information.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Regarding the Attorney General's role in advising the Government on a range of issues and the Minister of State's comment that it is not the role of the Attorney General to provide certification, who said that? That has come from the Minister of State's advisers, but there is nothing to stop the Attorney General from being given this power. As Senator Brian Hayes said, the Attorney General is in a unique position in that he or she is of the Government yet detached from it as its legal adviser. The Attorney General is in a position to advise the Government in a dispassionate, non-political way on which issues are in the national interest. We have kept the provision both wide and precise enough on issues such as health, safety, national security and the vital economic interests of the State. Those are the categories in which we would ask the Attorney General for a clear definition.I am sure the Attorney General often gives a written opinion to the Government. We want him to give a written opinion on whether the information sought comes under these categories, should not be released and comes under the extension of time from five years to ten years.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	267	It would be inappropriate to confer this duty on the Attorney General. I do not dispute what Senator Higgins has said regarding the role of the Attorney General, but it would be going a step beyond that to give him an executive function and ask him to make decisions which could have direct political implications. From that perspective, he or she would not be the appropriate person to do this. I also subscribe to the argument put forward by the Minister of State that one either includes everything or one excludes everything. If one gets into the business of saying it should be A, B or C, there is a recipe for total confusion.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	268	As Senator Dardis said, it is not appropriate for the Attorney General to become involved in executive decision-making. He or she has a role in advising the Government and it would not be appropriate to change that role to give the Attorney General decision-making power.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	269	There is some suggestion that the Attorney General and his office have no role regarding the freedom of information regime.

While the Office of the Attorney General is within the Department of the Taoiseach, I understand it is separate and information can be obtained within it in the same way that it is obtained from other Departments and offices.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I do not want to labour the point, but there is a distinction. Within the Office of the Attorney General, the designated person, not the Attorney General, would make the decision. That is why this amendment gives him an inappropriate function and has the potential to draw the Attorney General into political controversies in which he should not be involved.

I have no difficulty with the Attorney General making these decisions because it is not an executive role but a quasi-judicial one, though we need not go into that. If we have already agreed that these papers be closed for ten years and if one applies the principle of Occam's razor, there is no point in discussing what one would do with individual papers. The discussion should really fall on that basis.

In page 9, line 40 to delete subsection (d).The amendment addresses the need for the Government to consult party leaders before taking certain decisions. Its acceptance would ensure a degree of consultation would take place with those who were Ministers during the period to which a specific request related. Earlier Senator O'Rourke reflected the thinking behind section 19(4)(a) of the principal Act when she said members of the Cabinet, both individually and collectively, would have a view on matters raised under freedom of information requests.While the original Act was being passed, the current Government parties, the then Opposition, supported with alacrity the consultation process outlined in subsection 19(4) which remains an important part of the Act. I call on the Minister of State to continue his party's initial policy of support for it.

The consultation requirements set out in section 19(4) of the principal Act will be redundant in view of the provision contained in section 12(a)(i) which substitutes the words “shall refuse” for the words “may refuse” where they appear in section 19(1) of the principal Act. The effect is to remove the requirement for consultations under section 19(4) of the principal Act.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	288	That is fine. Section 12(e) is the meat of the legislation, without which I would support many of the changes being introduced by the Government. As I stated during my Second Stage speech, the crucial issues to which we object are all included in this section which is inconsistent with the report of the high level group. As I recall – I stand to be corrected – the group did not mention special advisers. The Information Commissioner states it is clear the intention of the Freedom of Information Act, as originally framed, differs from that of the high level group.The principal Act contains certain protections for communications between Ministers. The Bill proposes to substitute the definition of Government in section 19 with a new definition. It states:‘Government' includes–(a) a committee of the Government, that is to say, a committee appointed by the Government whose membership consists of–(i) members of the Government, or(ii) one or more members of the Government together with either or both of the following:(I) one or more Ministers of State,(II) the Attorney General .I am open to persuasion as to the necessity of this part of the new definition, which is not what disturbs me most. I accept it is sometimes important not to release into the public domain issues raised during the course of deliberations. However, having passed an amendment to increase the time period before which documents will not be released to ten years I cannot accept the next part of the definition which proposes to exempt committees of officials. The proposals place a cloak around Government and officials and make every option for obtaining information more difficult.While the top level group proposed extending the Freedom of Information Act, the Bill proposes to exempt a committee of officials which does not even include a member of the Government. It is outrageous that the deliberations of such committees should become exempt. There is no convincing argument in favour of the proposal other than that freedom of information requests are a slight irritation to Government.Cabinet memoranda are a separate issue. The Bill proposes that where the Government establishes a committee of officials to advise it or draw up a report, its material will be exempt from the Act. This is completely wrong. It turns the Act on its head and is at the core of the proposed close-down of the Cabinet. The Bill falls apart, not on the extension of the time period for access to documents to ten years or the other matters we have discussed, but on the proposed redefinition of Government.Having extended the definition of Government to officials the Bill then extends the definition of officials to include civil servants of both the Government and State. Not only will those working in Departments be covered but all those working for the State in other areas also. While I am not certain which employees will be covered – perhaps it includes the staff of Leinster House or other public offices – the proposal will mean that all work undertaken by such officials will be covered by the exemption.This may be bad but even worse is the fact that spin doctors, special advisers, are also included.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I have a great deal time for them. They do a very good job and I wish I had some of them working for me. The Bill proposes to place a wall of secrecy around those whose job is to control the flow of information. This is a retrograde step by any standards. The Government will probably respond by defending the honour of special advisers. I will save it the trouble; my comments are not a reflection on the decent people who work for the Government of the day.I am unique on this side of the House in several respects. I was one of the people who wanted a longer period, which we discussed previously. I also support the idea of programme managers and spin doctors because the Government should get the right message out to the people. That makes for good Government but if the special advisers, better known as spin doctors in some cases, are now exempt, that does not make any sense.It is completely unacceptable and there is no support for that position outside the Government parties. Does Maeve McDonagh, the authority the Minister of State quoted last night, support it? Does the Information Commissioner support it? A former ombudsman is in the House and he has offered views on this position. It is impossible to understand the reason we should put in place something which denies us access to the information provided by groups such as spin doctors and others.I will give a classic example of what is happening currently. The Government recently set up a committee to advise it on spending in the health service, reporting directly to the Government and not to the Department of Health and Children. I do not know who is on that committee but if they are people from various Departments, we would not have access to it. In other words, the next time a committee of officials is set up to consider a vitally important issue, the information will suddenly become exempt. That is nonsense. There is no support for this position. In fact, I withdraw all references to the committee I just mentioned because I can see what will happen. We will have a 20 minute debate on its membership. Let us forget the example I gave and stick to the principle, which is that under this provision people who are preparing documentation and advising Government, even outside the deliberative process, are now exempt. That is not acceptable and everything being said by the Information Commissioner confirms that. There is no support outside Government circles for this measure.The people who welcomed this in 1997, whoever they may be, are all opposed to it now. That is the reality. This is the wrong signal to send out to ordinary people at a time when nobody makes a distinction between various politicians. They are referred to as "those politicians". Unfortunately, we are all lumped together in that sense. This is an effort to restrict and control the information flow. It is like something from George Orwell.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I will be brief because we are very restricted regarding time and other Members want to come in. Article 28 of the Constitution is clear. It is headed, The Government, and states: "The Government shall consist of not less than seven and not more than fifteen members who shall be appointed by the President in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution". That is a clear definition. There is an attempt in this legislation to introduce a much broader definition of the Government. There are committees of officials, programme managers, spin doctors and advisers. Anybody the Government wants for the purpose of its interpretation of this legislation can now be defined as "Government".I am not the only person with that view. One only has to examine the report issued yesterday, which came into our possession yesterday afternoon, from the Information Commissioner. In the clearest possible terms he states:The proposed amendment [in section 12 of the Bill] is designed to exempt records of a "committee of officials" set up to assist the Government directly in relation to a particular matter. This is effected by substituting for the definition of "Government" currently contained in section 19(6) a much more far-reaching and constitutionally unrecognisable definition, which is, perhaps, unnecessary to achieve the objective it appears to have been designed to achieve [as explained in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill].On the next page of the report the Information Commissioner goes on to state:In addition, apart, altogether, from the constitutional unrecognisability of the definition as so extended, the proposed inclusion of a "committee of officials" within the definition of "Government" is likely to lead to difficulties of interpretation as the proposed amendment does not go so far as to indicate sufficiently clearly, if at all, when the expression "Government" in section 19, would admit to the possibility that a committee of officials is being referred to and when it would not.They are two very clear expressions from the commissioner on what he believes to be a flawed section in terms of what the Government is trying to do. He refers to a constitutionally unrecognisable definition and constitutional unrecognisability. It is beyond me why the Government should put itself in a position where it is in clear conflict with the Constitution and import into the Bill a section which would have the effect of having the entire Bill struck down to facilitate the incorporation of officials, programme managers, spin doctors and so on to bring them under the title of "Government".

It states: "(b) a committee of officials . appointed by the Government for the purpose of assisting the Government in relation to a particular matter that has been submitted to the Government for their consideration”. Many issues come before Government that involve complexities on which the Government finds it necessary to have further study and deliberation. It may be a sub-committee attended by both Ministers and officials. It may be delegated to senior officials like the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and one or two other officials and occasionally, although not very often, it can include special advisers, more so when the rainbow Government was in office and the Department of the Tánaiste was mainly made up of such people.

Much spadework has to be done before going into Cabinet and the important decisions are almost never taken at the first meeting. Some matters are discussed several times before a decision is made and senior officials have to tease out details. We are talking about the process as a whole. Bearing in mind that even this section is subject to the Information Commissioner, contrary to what the Senators opposite maintain it is tightly drawn. It is not related to anything officials or special advisers may do. It is not a blanket exemption, but a tightly drawn one affecting a group appointed by the Government to resolve a difficulty in respect of a decision it must make. As it relates to that type of work, it is perfectly defensible.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Senator Higgins has elucidated the comments of the Information Commissioner on the issue of extending the definition of Government, particularly in relation to this constitutional unrecognisability. I fully support his remarks. It is extraordinary that a Bill containing a provision which an independent officer would call constitutionally unrecognisable should come before either House of the Oireachtas. Senator Mansergh said that modern Government is complex. However, the Constitution is very clear on what constitutes Government in this country and that is unchangeable. Although I am not a lawyer, it seems to raise a major question over the constitutional reliability of this legislation.Senator Mansergh stated that the Government's intentions in respect of the committee of officials are clearly set out in the legislation. He also stated that the committee would assist the Government in a particular matter. However, the section later defines an official as "a person holding a position in the Civil Service or the Government or the Civil Service of the State" and "a special adviser". Having been a special adviser, like Senator Mansergh, I know they do make a contribution from time to time.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The 102 task forces, committees, etc., currently operating under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children – which provide cover for the Minister and replace the need for decision-making in his Department – would obviously come under the exemption contained in this provision. The section also provides that it is mandatory for the workings and writings of these officials to be exempt. This is the extent of the blanket of secrecy thrown around Government decisions. As Senator O'Toole said, this is very much personified in the section. It goes to the heart of the intention behind this amending legislation, which is concerned with covering decision-making. The Bill is also concerned with covering documents produced during the process of decision-making, a matter to which Senator Mansergh referred.I ask the Minister of State to provide an example of one Government decision that has been harmed, undermined or affected in a negative fashion by the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, particularly concerning documents relative to the deliberative process. I was quite interested to read Frank McDonald's article about Stadium Ireland in today's edition of The Irish Times. That article might explain why the Taoiseach has proposed the legislation. The freedom of information legislation allowed the public to find out about the potential overrun on the Taoiseach's pet project, Stadium Ireland. This revealed how much it would could cost the taxpayer and how decisions were being made. Is that why the Bill is before us today?

I know the Acting Chairman is in a neutral position. The PD spokesperson at the time, Deputy O'Donnell, said that section 19 of the legislation did not go far enough. She tabled an amendment, accepted by the then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, which narrowed the exemptions for documents going to Cabinet. This was mentioned in last weekend's Sunday Business Post and I would like to thank Mr. Vincent Browne.

That party tabled an amendment, which the Minister of State accepted, in order to ensure that the legislation would be as liberal as possible and that the issue of Cabinet confidentiality would not be used in such a fashion as to keep the public in the dark.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	337	All the points have been covered. I previously stated that the definition of official is so wide that, as Senator O'Meara pointed out, anybody can be included. On the Order of Business I mentioned all the committees within the Department of Health and Children. The real problem is that they do not report and now we will not be able to find out anything about them.I would like to read into the record the last words in the report by my new friend, the Information Commissioner. I am glad that I supported his appointment. I never thought I would find him so valuable. He states:Accordingly, it would appear that defining "Government" in such a way as to include a "committee of officials" may be an overly loose, unclear and inefficacious way of achieving what the Explanatory Memorandum sets out as the goal of the proposed amendment.This will return to haunt the Government as one of the most stupid items of legislation ever to come before the House. Like everyone else, I do not mind the change to ten years. This is the nub of the Bill. We will not be able to get information on anything once two or three people, who might have come in off the street, have gathered together and stated that they are acting in the Government's name.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	338	We do not want to elevate the words of my old friend, the Information Commissioner, to the status of holy writ any more than we would want to elevate the words of the high level committee. There could have been better constitutional proof reading of this section because Bills have gone to the Supreme Court before on this ground and been found wanting.I have great difficulty with this section. While I supported extension of the closure of Cabinet papers to ten years, I expected an extension of that order would be paralleled by a relaxation rather than a tightening of the restrictions. A line must be drawn but in this case it is too broad. I agree with Senator Mansergh about the complexity of modern government but developing a domino theory along these lines could cover everything. It might be snobbish of me but I take offence at the extension of the status of civil servants and special advisers to include people of any description found about the place, although that might be a form of eccentricity on my part.We should take another look at this matter on Report Stage to ensure the mantle of secrecy cannot be so easily thrown over any group or subject. Background papers are vital when one is making an assessment. I have written reports for Government on various issues and always tried to ensure I had the right of publication because if I am to be hanged, I want to be hanged for what I said myself, not for the gloss some Minister puts on it.This is an important part of understanding what government is about. It is in the interests of good government that we do not draw this too tightly.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The intention of the original legislation in 1997 was to let the public see the workings of the decision making process. That was the serious purpose of the Act. The tittle-tattle about Ministers going to Honolulu for St. Patrick's Day and how much it cost and how many they took, the tabloidisation of FOI, was irrelevant. The most significant sections concern decision making.By excluding committees, expert groups which report to Government and background papers, Ministers are being denied the opportunity to be seen to make decisions independently. I suspect that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is totally opposed to this. He regularly reads reports from expert groups and comes to the totally opposite opinion. He is entitled to do this, he is a politician who stands up and says he disagrees with civil servants and when he stands for election, he takes the rap one way or another. I admire the guts he has shown, although I might not agree with the positions he has taken.What is so wrong with allowing reports from expert groups being made public, whether an issue is resolved? Senator Mansergh said last night that the views of the taxation strategy group would continue to be published. I would like to hear the Minister of State's view because I doubt they will be.When tax individualisation was introduced, there was a huge public debate on the issue. We were entitled to know the views of the expert group which helped the Government form opinions. It was good for politics. It is good for the public to see that there is real debate among those who give their views to Ministers. That was the objective of the legislation. All the other stuff about how much trips cost and the class at which a Minister travelled is irrelevant.This is at the heart of the public knowing about the Government decision making process. By excluding committees from the workings of the FOI regime we are doing a huge disservice to the dissemination of information in the State.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Although I have been a Member of this House for ten years and taken part in debates on quite a few Bills, I have never seen anything like section 12(2)(c). It becomes meaningless if one includes a provision referring to “a person who is a member of such other class as may be prescribed”. Why take a page and a quarter to deal with this, rather than simply making it applicable to any committee that contains anybody? It is just ridiculous.What really saddens me is that this Bill contains quite valuable measures but is spoiled by the inclusion of this provision. A number of Senators have expressed their agreement with the extension of the five year period to ten years. It is acceptable that any legislation should be reconsidered after five years. However, to include something as foolish and outrageous as, in effect "this covers everybody" is totally unacceptable. It could just as easily have been stated in one line on the previous page.I am disappointed that we have ended up in a situation where this Bill is being rushed through the House. I will be even more disappointed if we do not get the Minister of State's response. I hope we will at least hear his response and that we will not be subjected to the guillotine as has been suggested.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	401	I formally welcome Deputy John Bruton to the House and commend him on his important work in the Presidium of the Convention on the Future of Europe. I invite him to address the House.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	402	It is indeed a great honour for me to address this House. I might have thought I would never have the opportunity to stand in this place again. I am very grateful to the Seanad for the honour it has done me in inviting me to address it as a humble Member of the Dáil. I have prepared some remarks which are available for circulation to Senators. I believe I have more copies than are required for the number of Senators in the House just now.Before going in detail into the work of the Convention, I would like to deal with the contention that the European Union is developing into a super-state. Not only is the European Union not a super-state, it is not even a state. I say that because it has no right to use force and no right to raise an army – the key prerogatives that define a state. Furthermore, it has no right to raise taxes or to borrow money to meet current expenses. For all these things, the European Union has no prerogatives. It depends entirely on member states.To underline the point, the key principle of European Union constitutional law is the principle of conferral. All powers of the Union are conferred on it voluntarily by member states. That principle is reaffirmed in the draft treaty being prepared in the Convention on the Future of Europe. What the European Union has is the power to make common policies and common laws, or laws in common, for the Union as a whole and its laws have supremacy over national laws where there is a conflict between them.The European Union has been very good for Ireland. It has given us a method whereby we may manage our relations with all our neighbours in a constructive framework which protects the interests of small countries like ourselves, as well as those of bigger powers. The European Union, and its predecessor, the Common Market, were brought into being to create a structure of economic inter-dependence in Europe, based on rules, laws, frameworks and inter-dependence so close that war between European countries would be unthinkable. This objective has been achieved and the continent of Europe, apart from the former Yugoslavia, has enjoyed the longest uninterrupted period of peace in its history, perhaps since the 14th century – I am sure Senator Mansergh will assist me if I have exaggerated in that regard.Of course all of this cannot be credited to the European Union. The United States military presence in Europe and the predictability that the Cold War gave to international relations also contributed significantly to fifty years of peace in Europe. Some American writers, notably Robert Kagan who has been much quoted in recent weeks, have belittled the European Union on the ground that it has naively tried to substitute its practice of rules, laws, and frameworks for the exercise of power in international relations as well as in its own domestic affairs. I rebut this criticism. The European Union's emphasis on rules, laws and frameworks does not exclude the use of the direst penalties, including military force, to ensure that the outcomes of those processes are respected, but it does create a framework of predictability in which those who might contemplate breaking the rules can rationally think through the consequences before it is too late.The newly declared American preference for pre-emptive strikes, set out in the Westpoint address of the President of the United States and in the strategy document the US has produced, is very different from the previous doctrines which have applied. It creates the conditions in which in future nobody will be able to predict the outcome of any international behaviour and there will be no process whereby that may be determined and no predictability as to the outcome. That will create, in international relations, the law of the jungle. The law of the jungle is not just brutal. It is unpredictable and unpredictability is the greatest enemy of peace.In light of the crisis over Iraq, the most urgent task of the Convention on the Future of Europe will now be that of equipping the European Union with a strong common foreign, security and defence policy which, unlike the present one, will work, be truly independent and protect our citizens in an increasingly dangerous world. Individual European nations, even those as great as Britain or France, do not have the resources for doing that job on their own. No European power is big enough for that.Europe cannot subcontract its defence to the United States forever and, depending on its experience in Iraq, the United States will either go on to confront other rogue states in other parts of the globe in ways that Europeans will be unable to support or, more likely, revert to the sort of isolationism that allowed it to stand aside while Hitler took over mainland Europe in 1940. In any event, it is not feasible for 5% of the world's population, the inhabitants of the United States, to bear indefinitely the burden of maintaining military pre-eminence over the remaining 95% of the population.What would be the ingredients of a common European foreign and security policy that would work? These issues are at the heart of the debate in the Convention in this area. The first ingredient would be that the Commission be given the principal power of policy initiative across the whole area, and that it administer a new European Union diplomatic service throughout the world. The second would be that the Council of Ministers would make the decisions, on behalf of the states, on the basis of Commission proposals, and that these decisions would be loyally followed by all members, big and small. The third would be that European military forces would become truly inter-operable and co-operate with one another so as to complement rather than, as they currently do, duplicate one another. That implies a European armaments agency, recommended by one of the working groups of the Convention, to co-ordinate purchasing of equipment.The fourth, and probably most radical and controversial ingredient, would be that the European Union should have a single seat on the United Nations Security Council. As long as France and Britain have separate seats, both will continue to play to the gallery in New York and pursue prestige. Separate Security Council seats for France and Britain institutionalise foreign policy division in Europe and are structurally incompatible with the evolution of a genuinely common foreign and security policy.If I had been making this speech to the Seanad four weeks ago, or even two weeks ago, I would not have put common foreign and security policy at the top of my speech. I would not have singled it out as the most important challenge, but the events of the past two weeks have required me to rethink my own set of priorities in this area and that is why I have stressed this first. It is a most important issue which obviously has major implications for this country and for all of the groups represented in this House, both in terms of the way all of us think about our place in the world and how we may preserve what we have come to enjoy.After common foreign and security policy, the next big task for the Convention is to make the European Union more democratic. There is a democratic deficit in Europe. We must accept that the more complex the political system, the lower will be the turnout at election time. The European Union political system is incredibly complex. Therefore, simplifying the structure is essential to the creation of a genuine democratic base for Europe.The citizens of Europe, in my view, should directly elect the President of the Commission, in the same way as the citizens of the United States directly elect the President of their union. A simple choice of candidates for the Presidency of the European Commission would attract people out to vote because ultimately people are more interested in people than in ideas. A current complex system that allows people to vote directly for one member in one part of Europe's Legislature, the European Parliament, but not for the people who will represent them in the other part, the Council of Ministers, is far too complex to attract the sort of turnout we need. Here at national level, voters can change their Government at election time but at European level, the most we are able to change at the time of a European election is one MEP out of 700 or more. That is not good enough. It does not give voters a sense that they can achieve change. Accountability and democratic responsibility require that voters be able to change the direction and the people at the top in Europe.We should be able to change the person in charge, the President of the Commission. That decision should not be made behind closed doors, or in a back door deal between Prime Ministers and leaders of the parties in the European Parliament, as many propose. The people should be the ones to make that decision. Otherwise there is no true accountability.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	404	That is what I would prefer. I would far prefer the proposals put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on behalf of the Government, to any of the other alternatives. If I cannot get what I would like, the proposals of the Government are the next best thing. At least the Government's proposals leave the door open ultimately to popular election, whereas the proposals being promoted by the European Parliament, to my mind at least, have this fault of ultimately ensuring that these decisions will be made within a closed elite circle in Brussels and Strasbourg rather than by the people.Part of the problem for Europe is that some of the most politically interesting decisions in Europe are taken, not at political level but at administrative level. For example, while it may be politicians in the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament who will decide on the broad legislative principles governing the safety and efficacy of drugs – a boring and abstract subject – the really interesting decision on whether, for example, to allow Viagra to be marketed was taken in some management committee.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Somebody always takes the fun out of it.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	406	It is dangerous to make any reference of this kind in the Seanad of all places, but I hope Senators will forgive me. While I would not wish to politicise such decisions, there must be a more developed mechanism whereby elected politicians, at national and European level, can get those who do make those decisions to explain their decisions or, perhaps more often, to explain why they are failing to make decisions.To make Europe more democratic, we must simplify Europe's constitution so that every European citizen can easily find out who does what, and who is to blame. Without a blame-taker, there is no democracy. Each citizen must be able to find out easily what the European Union may do, and what it may not do. We have made progress in the Convention on these matters to date. We are almost half-way through the drafting of the first part of a new constitution for Europe which will answer those four basic questions, and it will be a readable document that will go a long way towards ensuring that people know who does what, etc.In addition to protecting our external security, Europe must be able to protect its internal security. We must ensure there are no hiding places for organised crime anywhere in the European Union. There must be no equivalent of a fiscal paradise for crime bosses. Cross-border crimes, crimes over the Internet, multinational fraud, terrorism, and the trade in drugs and people can best be tackled on a European rather than an individual state basis.The fundamental principle on which we are working is mutual recognition. Each EU country should recognise every other country's court decisions, fines, disqualifications and orders for discovery of documents and other information. It should also recognise every other state's arrest warrants. For this to work there must be some approximation of laws and court procedures. For decisions such as these to be made in a union of 25 countries we will need to move to majority voting in some areas in which unanimity is still the rule. This has been a matter of some controversy in this country but, unlike some controversies, has been useful in elucidating the issues.I do not want to absorb too much of the allotted time with my presentation because the most valuable part of a discussion such as this is in the exchange between the Members and the speaker. In the interests of brevity, therefore, I have made a personal selection of the many interesting issues coming up in the Convention: common foreign policy, defence policy, democratisation and criminal law. There are a number of areas I have not covered which I will mention before I conclude.What balance should be struck between promoting efficiency through competition and preserving universal services such as postal services in remote areas? This is a very lively argument in the Convention and has many ramifications and applications. What balance should be struck between the power of the Commission, a truly European institution, and the European Council, an intergovernmental one? The proposals from four of the bigger states for a full-time president of the European Council would clearly tilt the balance away from the Commission. This is controversial, especially among small states.How should the European Parliament be elected? The Parliament is supposed to have devised for itself a uniform electoral system but has completely failed to reach agreement. As a result, the matter has now been referred to the Convention. Should it be a list system or our own system of proportional representation? Should we have trans-border European constituencies as well as ones within nation states?Should the EURATOM Treaty, dealing with nuclear power, be updated to emphasise safety and affirm the European Union's right to close down unsafe nuclear activities? I have made a proposal to the Convention that we take this opportunity of underlining the fact that if Sellafield is dangerous, the European Union has the power to close it. It does have that power, as a result of a court decision last year. It may be useful to underline this in the treaty.Should a national legislature such as the Seanad have the right to go to court to challenge an EU law as going too far in "Europeanising" an area of activity, thus breaching the protocol on subsidiarity originally negotiated in Amsterdam and now being carried forward? Should it have the right to do this independently of the Dáil? Should legislatures be involved in initiating legal actions at all? If this becomes the pattern, will it slow down the process of European legislation, perhaps to the disadvantage of smaller countries which may need European norms in a particular area to avoid having the norms of big states imposed upon them unilaterally? These are very important questions of striking a balance.Is the present balance of power among large and small states appropriate? If every country continues to have one Commissioner only, is it viable that in the enlarged European Union 19 Commissioners should come from 19 countries with only 20% of the Union's population while the remaining six come from six countries which have 80% of the population? This is a very controversial and difficult issue. The big countries see it one way and the small countries another. It will not be an easy battle for the smaller countries but we should think it through.Given that the European Union already has the power to strike down any tax policy that is discriminatory or constitutes unfair competition, as it struck down our manufacturing tax rate and export sales relief, what conceivable justification is there for the widespread demand, from every country except the United Kingdom and Ireland, for the introduction of qualified majority voting on tax matters in order to impose a minimum rate of corporation tax?We are at a critical moment in national, European and global history. As the poet John Donne said, no man is an island. Ireland may be an island physically but as far as the forces that shape the lives of our people are concerned, we do not live on an island. The best way we can protect ourselves from bad forces and harness good ones is by working together with our fellow Europeans.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I welcome Deputy John Bruton and thank him for a stimulating address. He made very clear distinctions among the choices that we, Europeans, in the form of our parties and Governments, will have to make as we move forward to the next Intergovernmental Conference. He put those choices very starkly, thereby posing the question in a very useful manner. I also congratulate him for managing to fill the Chamber following our deliberations earlier this afternoon, which were a bit fractious. His calm presence was a great help to us all.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	408	He is lovely.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Would that it were. He is aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, and Mr. Proinsias de Rossa, MEP, have been in the House in recent weeks to tell us their experience of their work in the Convention on our behalf. Is it the case that members of the Praesidium, and the Convention generally, take positions according to the views of their political groupings in Europe rather than those of their national assemblies? How are they arriving at their conclusions? Is it the case, for example, that our conclusions from an Irish perspective are being arrived at as a result of discussions between the Deputy and other members of the Irish delegation to the Convention, or are his conclusions being arrived at from the point of view of the Christian Democrats?Whatever the outcome of the Convention, it will feed into the next Intergovernmental Conference process. Will the Deputy explain to the House where he thinks the process will go? There is not much point in having a convention to direct the future of Europe in a straightforward way if this is completely rolled back by the next Intergovernmental Conference. From his discussions at European level, will he tell us where he thinks the choices will be in terms of future Intergovernmental Conferences?The Deputy said one of the great challenges for Europe and those of us in politics generally was to ensure European documents, European law and our ambitions as a member of the European Union were easily understood or, to use his word, readable. When the President of the European Parliament came to address the House last year, he painted a vivid picture of that process. I would like to know if Deputy Bruton is in agreement with this. His explanation was that if one were to go into an Irish national school several years from now, there would be two charts. The first would outline one's rights and obligations as a citizen of this State; the second would outline one's rights and obligations as a citizen of the European Union. It would be a simple delineation of those rights from an Irish perspective and a European perspective. Does the Deputy agree with this illustration used by Pat Cox in the House last year?On behalf of Fine Gael, I welcome the Deputy to the House and thank him for his stirring address.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I, too, welcome Deputy John Bruton to the House. We have had a series of contributions on the Convention of Europe through Mr. De Rossa MEP, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and Deputy Bruton. I recognise that all mentioned have worked as a team. I pay tribute to the work done by the Deputy both from reading the working reports that have come forward from the Convention and, secondly, as a member of the Presidium. There has been a huge commitment by Deputy Bruton to making this new Convention and its decisions work. This ensures that we will have a European Constitution that will stay the test of time, reflect the many views found in Europe and be easily read and accessible. There has been a criticism that such documents were far removed from the citizens of the European Union.We have moved forward, which the Deputy mentioned. When the Union started, it was initially an economic union; then it moved to the monetary stage. We are now coming into the political stage which has become most important in relation to defence and security issues – more so, since the events of 11 September 2001 and the immediate threat of war.I want to refer to the Deputy's thinking on the election of the President of the Commission. There are two schools of thought on this issue. The Minister of State's concept is that the electoral college should reflect both national parliaments and the European Parliament. This would be one way of overcoming the democratic deficit that seems to have existed heretofore. Deputy Bruton's thinking is that the citizens of European would go to the ballot box and they would have the power to change direction, should that be necessary. How far has that thinking moved? Are there many EU members going along with the concept? How complicated would it be to bring the idea into a working framework? It is all about democratic accountability and accessibility to representatives. The electoral college model may, in the end, work better if the direct election model does not. I would like to know the correlation between the two concepts and which idea is coming forward as the better approach at the end of the day. This is a major issue into which the Deputy has put much thought.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I also welcome Deputy John Bruton to the House. His statements were very interesting and stimulating. The House is in the Deputy's debt for the work done by him and his colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and Mr. De Rossa. I regret that this important work is not making a greater impact on Irish society as it should. What is happening in the House is an important part in the permeation of information. I am not surprised, considering the Deputy's nature, that he picked the thorniest issues and put them to the forefront. It has always been his way and it is a great way of addressing issues.I agree there is a need to look at the common defence and security policy. I will put one pertinent question. Deputy Bruton talked about the importance for Ireland of having a position and the question of the Security Council. The Deputy did not explain how Ireland would balance its position between Europe and the UN. The argument made by many against the first section of the Deputy's statement is that the UN should police the world. I believe that Ireland should work out its position in Europe, have a position in the Security Council and then accept the democratically taken decision of the UN on world affairs.On the issue of extradition, I do not agree with the Deputy. The then Attorney General, Michael McDowell, argued vehemently two years ago against the mutual recognition of arrest warrants. I agree with the principle but the problem lies in the implementation. It moves away from the very concept of extradition which can have no place in a properly organised Europe. On the other hand, I cannot see a situation arise where an individual can be extradited from one country for something that is not a crime in that country. The implementation of this seems to be impossible.On the question of taxation, is it not also the case that applicant countries have views that are closer to ours than those of others? The entry of some of those countries might change the Irish view. Estonia and a number of the other applicant countries do not have corporation tax. There are many in Ireland who are very liberal in their views on corporation tax and do not wish to see it at the higher European level. However, when they see these countries enter the EU, I am sure this will change.On the issue of the Presidency of the European Commission, I agree with Deputy Bruton on the direct election proposal. One issue that the Deputy did not deal with was the democratic deficit between the Commission and the Parliament and the difference between the large and small states. I suggest a model based on the US system – in terms of structure only – whereby every state, whether large or small, whether it be Alaska or New Hampshire with a few million inhabitants or California with tens of millions, has two people in the US Senate. Such a house – I understand "Senate" might give the wrong impression – would take much of the authority which is currently vested in the Commission. It would, therefore redress the democratic deficit by moving to an elected upper House where there would be two representatives from each member state. This would also act as a control on the Parliament. This aspect of the US structure works very well. Would the Deputy agree with this suggestion?There are words that need to be defined –"confederation" as opposed to "federation". Whenever anyone mentions "federation" in Europe, it makes national headlines in the UK in particular, and it is picked up here by people who oppose the European project. What Deputy Bruton has described is much closer to a confederation than a federation, but probably somewhere in between. Yet if it were to be given a name, where would one put it? People discussing Europe should start making the distinction, even if only to contradict people who are applying certain qualities to a federation which do not exist, and using "federation" as a synonym for "super state". I agree absolutely with Deputy Bruton's rejection of that Thatcherite description of Europe.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I join previous speakers in welcoming Deputy Bruton and thank him for his very frank and direct speech. Once again he showed that he was not afraid to raise the thorny questions that so many people discussing Europe like to avoid. We must face these issues. The Convention is timely, given the European enlargement before us, and we must look at the management structures of the EU to ensure it works properly. We have learnt lessons here, particularly during the Nice referendum, and we could equate them with lessons learnt from the recent poll in Malta. There are issues to do with convincing people, and the Convention should take heed of these lessons.For example, it is clear to me that the understanding among the public of general EU issues is very weak, and it is to the discredit of all of us that we have failed to communicate properly with the electorate in explaining these issues. Such failure plays into the hands of the Eurosceptics who can often attract many votes with simple and often incorrect slogans, while those of us who are pro-Europe must go into much analytical debate to get our points across.We have also seen in the last Nice referendum that Irish people, like others, value their Constitution, and are concerned that activities of the Convention could downgrade or weaken it. Equally, we all value the democratic process and there are some fears of secret activities among small numbers of people who do not fully engage in the democratic process. We need to take heed of the lessons learned, particularly when we are trying to educate the public in the months ahead, and to bring them with us on these issues. Such issues are important to us as politicians, because regardless of our political differences, we are the ones trying to promote them to the electorate.I would like to know if the Convention is taking heed of how we are to communicate our message to the people, because it is clear to me that the websites, brochures and various other means we have used to communicate the European message have not worked, because the people are not engaged. We all know how difficult it is to sell these European messages, and I wonder if the Convention is proposing any new ideas to bring forward its benefits to the people.Deputy Bruton also referred to current EU make-up. The six major members make up nearly 80 per cent of the EU population, with the remaining 19 countries making up the balance. How are we to convince these 19 countries that this Convention is in their interest? That is a huge challenge.Deputy Bruton also touched on the Iraqi situation, and his views on security and defence were interesting ones which I would share. In recent weeks we have seen France wanting the EU to be a counterweight against the US, Spain wanting to play a bigger role in world affairs, a number of EU candidate states expressing their desire to be closer to the US. We relate this to Mr. Chirac's comments about the candidate states not having been very well-behaved. When all this is taken into consideration, it must be asked of Deputy Bruton what impact these national, EU and international priorities are having on the workings of the Convention over the past few weeks.Deputy Bruton said that if he himself had been speaking in this House a few weeks ago, this issue would not have been at the top of his priority list. This shows how Deputy Bruton's priorities have changed, but have the Convention's priorities changed too? We have a problem in convincing the people that this issue is affecting the Convention, because if they think otherwise, we are losing the battle before we start. I would welcome Deputy Bruton's views on how we might change the emphasis, because with the divergence of opinions, it is hard to know how we can bring them all together under the Convention.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I too welcome Deputy Bruton to the Seanad. His presentation was interesting and forthright.I want first to address the issue of the common foreign and security policy. Deputy Bruton's presentation today, and the article on this issue in today's edition of The Irish Times, were extremely forthright. If they represented the mainstream of Christian Democratic thinking, or indeed Social Democratic thinking within the EU, we would be in a very different situation from that we appear to be in now. I say that with a sense of regret, and with no wish to score points.The last few weeks have been very depressing for those of us who believe that Europe should be trying to present a common face to the world, and to define its own interests vis-à-vis the rest of the world and indeed internally. Deputy Bruton's proposals regarding the common foreign and security policy are very far-reaching and positive. I would find it difficult to find fault with any of them. The proposal, for example, that Europe should have just one seat on the United Nations Security Council is a good one.We are a long way however from some of those measures. Most of us in Ireland still think of foreign policy as basically touching on most of the states which are or will shortly be members of the EU. We are going to have to redefine what we currently think of as foreign affairs as being simply internal affairs.Deputy Bruton's presentation concentrated greatly on process, on the means by which we would develop a common foreign security policy, rather than the principles that might underpin it. He concentrated on how it might be structured and articulated, rather than on the policy itself. I wonder which comes first, or must we develop both at the same time? We have struggled to develop, for example, a common EU policy on the Middle East. Some progress has been made in this area through the quadripartite talks continuing, but beyond that it is difficult to point to a success story in terms of major matters of international controversy.The last few weeks have been an unmitigated disaster in terms of the EU projecting a common face to the world. Not only has it failed in that regard, but the main players have clearly given up trying. They do not even think that the European aspect of it is to be concentrated on with any degree of interest. Those of them in a position to do so are simply pursuing national interest, and those of us who do not have a major international role, by virtue of not being on the Security Council, are consigned to irrelevance. It is interesting to see the reflections of the smaller countries on the UN Security Council, many of whom would clearly prefer not to be there. It makes one wonder whether a UN Security Council which contains small states which cannot act independently without suffering serious consequences in terms of their relations with, for example, the US, is worth having.I believe the time has come to agree to tax harmonisation. There are two separate issues here. One is whether we should have a low rate of corporation tax , and the other is whether we should agree to qualified majority voting in terms of taxation. We already have various measures, for example VAT, where we agree to harmonise rates within various European countries. I have always been uncomfortable with the notion that we could take subsidies from richer European countries while undercutting their rates of corporation tax with a lower one. Whether one is uncomfortable about it, it is in our own selfish national interests which, I acknowledge, justifies it. However, we have reached a point where it is no longer in our selfish national interests to do so for precisely the reasons Senator O'Toole mentioned. It will shortly be in our selfish national interests to defend our relatively low corporation tax rate against countries that want an even lower one. The time has clearly come where principle, convenience and pragmatism intersect. We should be pushing, therefore, for some level of harmonisation – not a specific rate – but perhaps a common low rate on which we could all agree.The issue of trying to move towards some sort of common recognition of arrest warrants within legal systems is an interesting one. Deputy John Bruton will be familiar with a particular difficulty as he is a member of the committee which deals with it at the Convention, that is, what happens once someone is arrested? In some countries it is regarded as acceptable and normal practice that people are arrested and detained for quite some time before being charged. It is, therefore, possible for the charge to be investigated while they are still in detention. The legal requirement in this country is that a person must have goods on him on her before he or she is arrested and one must be in a position to charge him or her almost immediately. I am still uncomfortable with the notion that our citizens would be automatically open to arrest and extradition and could be detained in a Greek jail, for instance, for two years, before being charged. It is necessary to work out some of these issues before we can go down that road. However, I have no difficulty with the concept in principle, on the contrary, I support it.I welcome Deputy John Bruton and look forward to the discussion.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I, too, welcome Deputy John Bruton. This series of three speakers has been remarkably interesting. Each has had a different style, giving a sense of novelty which would not have obtained had the three come before the House together to give their views. I admire the Deputy's force of opinion and determination. Life is odd and throws up events. The Deputy has been an ideal person to fill his particular post at the Convention. I was interested in his comments on common foriegn and security policy because the Iraq crisis has focused all our minds on the obvious path of aggrandisement upon which the United States has embarked. It cannot continue because it might gobble up Iraq today but tomorrow it might be another country which is gobbled up.The Deputy's speech often touched on how we make the European Union acceptable to people in all member states. We can consider dumbing-down, making it more simple, printing posters and so on but it is clearly more fundamental than this. How does the Deputy think we can enthuse the electorate time and again, as we had to do for the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice? Collectively and individually, we made a mistake in our approach to the first referendum. We learned the lesson and went out and enthused people but I do not know if we can continue to do this. How can we make it simpler, more understandable and imbue it with a passion? There must be a passion for the European project because, if there is not, it will ultimately fail. There will be challenges and difficult decisions for countries and their citizens to address. However, some small changes have already been accepted without much fuss such as the provision for reduced numbers of MEPs and other provisions deriving from the Treaty of Nice. How will we continue to inject passion, interest and voting strength into all matters European, while remaining in touch with our own sense of nationality? How do we fundamentally reconcile European and national priorities?I was interested by what the Deputy said about postal capacity as a universal service  vis-à-vis competition. Market forces will dictate our services while non-market forces will affect their capability and the comfort zone of having the necessary things in life. I thank the Deputy for coming before the House.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I, too, welcome Deputy John Bruton. A number of questions have been posed. Perhaps the Deputy would like to deal with them now.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	417	One of the reasons I brought forward the notion of directly electing the President of the European Commission was not because the President would be in a position of great power but because it was a way, every five years, of allowing people in Ireland, Britain, Latvia and Italy to make a choice about an individual. That making of a choice about an individual would be the best way of getting people interested because the individuals campaigning would have to put forward their respective priorities and, in the process of the campaign, people would become interested. Whether we examine the "You're A Star" television programme or the election of the President of the European Commission, it is people and contests that get others interested. That sort of contest is the best way I can think of for meeting the real problem to which the Leader of the House referred.In response to Senator McDowell, the principles which should govern the CFSP should be respect for international law and process. Process reduces the likelihood of disputes boiling over. The difference between the European and American approaches is that we are placing more emphasis on a process that allows people opportunities to back down, whereas the Americans see a problem and want to go for it. That is a fundamental psychological, as well as political, difference between the way the two continents approach issues which is founded in their different histories. Europe's history has been relatively unfortunate compared to America's fortunate one.I am not convinced the time for tax harmonisation has come. As a person with a particular European conviction, I prefer not to have unanimity and do not want to be in a position of preserving it. However, I do not like the motives of those who seek for it to be done away with in this area. Their motives are suspect – they just do not want to have to compete. They do not want to face up to their problems and want to force everyone to have the same problems. I do not buy this. I have no hesitation in supporting the Government's position on the matter. However, we are quite isolated and it may be necessary for the Government to construct alternative positions in case the weight of pressure is too great. That is a matter which the Taoiseach is well able to assess in his own way and I have no doubt he will do so.On the point made by Senator Minihan, the interesting thing is that on the surface the dispute over Iraq has not affected the equilibrium or equanimity of the Convention. There was a touching episode in which I saw the Spanish and German Foreign Ministers embracing one another in a friendly way. I presume it was done because we were in public but the relationship at the Convention – as one expects among sophisticated people experienced in politics – is quite good. Beneath the surface, however, the events of recents weeks have done terrible damage and will do more. If British soldiers come home in body bags from a war resolutely opposed by France and Germany, it is impossible to conceive this would not affect the dynamics of the relationships between the peoples concerned. However well members of the Convention may get on with one another, we must all return to our respective electorates and this will make it more difficult to get a deal.Tony Blair is a key figure in European politics. For the next two or three months he will have his mind completely absorbed with the war and its aftermath. He will not be able to give the necessary time or mental energy to agreeing to the compromises that will have to be made on his behalf by Peter Hain if we are to get a deal at the Convention.Senator Brian Hayes asked where the Convention is leading to. The members of the Convention are all investing a considerable amount of time in it. I do not think members would be satisfied to produce a document containing a series of options to be handed to the intergovernmental conference and ask it to reach agreement. Such an outcome would be a waste of our time. It would be a reflection of failure not just on the members of the Convention, but on the national Governments, all of which are represented in the Convention. While we will work to find a deal in the Convention, it will be difficult for the reasons outlined.Senator Minihan and the Leader referred to the understanding of the electorate of the issues concerned and the prospects of a successful referendum on a treaty at the end of the process. The Convention is a novel way of engaging people. There was no debate in the Seanad prior to the negotiation of the Nice treaty. The negotiations for that treaty were carried out by diplomats in Iveagh House whom Members would probably struggle to name. Irish and other diplomats presented unresolved issues to the heads of government at an overwrought summit in Nice. I hope the people will understand the outcome of this much better.The work of the Forum on Europe has also been useful in providing information. A horse may be taken to water but it cannot be made to drink. While members of the public are not totally engaged in this, they will not be able to say they did not have the chance to find out about it.Senator O'Toole asked about the relationship between the proposed CFSP and the UN. The EU should have one seat on the Security Council – France and Britain should cease to have a seat each. The EU will continue to conduct its common foreign and security policy on the basis of the UN Charter, as it already does.A common European arrest warrant has already been agreed to. It was agreed to, perhaps reluctantly, in December 2001 by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, with the assent and involvement of the then Attorney General who is now the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While it is not present in law as yet, political agreement for it is in place.If we are to have a common arrest warrant, minimum procedures must be put in place. There must be minimum guarantees about bail and, if one is tried in another jurisdiction, the translation of proceedings into one's own language or a language one understands must also be guaranteed. Minimum procedural guarantees are essential if the common arrest warrant is to work in a fair way. We will probably need qualified majority voting to achieve agreement on these procedures.

A lively debate is also going on within the Government. The atmosphere among the Irish delegation to the Convention is open and frank. The Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, without breaking any confidences, tells me the concerns of the Government and the range of opinions within it. I respect that. Last week I sent him a seven page letter describing events at a confidential meeting of the EPP I attended. While we do not agree on everything, we are working together in a constructive way.I pay tribute to the Taoiseach for allowing both of the principal seats representing the Oireachtas to be held by Opposition politicians – no other country has done this. I also express my appreciation to Deputy Noonan for having chosen me to be one of those representatives.

I do not represent the Government or an Irish position. In chairing the group, I have to seek compromises, some of which Deputy Pat Carey, on behalf of the Government, did not agree with. I have a job to do and I try to reconcile different imperatives. I have imperatives from my party at national and European level, my country and my views on Europe. One is always trying to reconcile these and does the best one can.Senator Ormonde asked how much support there is for my proposal for the direct election of the President of the European Commission. While most people agree with it, they do not want to see it done now.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	425	If this is to be the basis of a constitution that is to last for 30 or 50 years as Giscard d'Estaing says, why not do it now? What is the point of complaining in five years' time that the people are not interested if they have not been given the opportunity to have a say? While I do not think the proposal of the Government is perfect, I am attracted to it because it leaves the door open. If this office is handed over to the European Parliament it will never give it up. While they dress this up as being in the European interest, the Commission, Parliament and Council are seeking more influence for themselves.With regard to Senator Brian Hayes's last point, the President of the European Parliament was being a trifle poetic in saying that he thought the European bill of rights could be put on a school wall alongside the Irish bill of rights. It would take me too long to explain why it is not likely to be as simple as that. It will not work out quite that well. However, we will get a little nearer to it than we are at present.

Hopefully, the states will all one day agree to elect the President of the Commission. Most people would be happy to know that it will not be a united federal states of Europe. Deputy Bruton explained it well. The Union has its own distinct qualities. It has accepted a number of new member states. There must be a vetting procedure with regard to minimum standards of democracy in new member states in their national election procedures. What concerns me and probably many other people in this country is the situation in an applicant country such as Turkey, which is not yet ready for membership and where 10% of the vote is required to get into Parliament. Will Deputy Bruton comment on that?

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	431	It is a great pleasure to welcome Deputy John Bruton to the House. I thank him for the enormous effort and the fundamental contribution he is making to the debate on the future of Europe, his great accomplishment of having chaired a working group on a contentious subject and brought it to near consensus and constructive agreement and for his work on the Presidium. It is good to know, where Ireland is concerned, that his mind has not been too broadened by travel.I also thank Deputy Bruton for this contribution to the National Forum on Europe. He has readily come to the forum with his colleagues, straight from the Council Chamber, as it were, to give us a full flavour of the discussions. It is hugely important that all of us manage to engage the Irish people in this debate. The Leader is to be congratulated on organising this series of meetings with the people who are conducting the debate in the Convention.I must also confess to being an Augustinian on the issue of an elected President. I have two concerns. The first involves recognition from the Aran Islands to the Peloponnese. The second is probably more substantial. I worry about what I see happening with the American Presidency, where the cost of maintaining a campaign is so large that the office is confined to people who either have the money or put themselves in hock to other people in order to obtain it.It is difficult to explain the intricacies of qualified majority voting to the ordinary voter. Has anybody considered an alternative, such as a weighted majority vote along with a majority of the states voting? It is a type of double lock. How is it proposed to deal with the amendments that are coming forward and the other sections of the draft constitution as they are drafted? Where does Deputy Bruton see the charter of fundamental rights fitting in?I thank Deputy Bruton both for his contribution and for his wider work at the Convention.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I also congratulate Deputy John Bruton on the work he has done. It is highly admired. Sometimes we use big words to try to sell things. I talked to somebody recently who had travelled to Barcelona for the weekend because he and his wife had got the flights at such a cheap rate. He credited this to the European Union, Peter Sutherland and the late Jim Mitchell. He knew that Ryanair could not have existed without them. He was pinpointing the specific advantages. When we are trying to draw attention to the benefits of Europe, it could be an easier task because there are so many good things for which we can be thankful.A person from one of the candidate nations, which was previously a communist country, told me he did not want to substitute another big brother for the big brother that had existed in Moscow. He did not want somebody from Brussels to take away the power his country has become used to having. He was concerned, as are others, about Article 1, which talks about administering certain common competences on a federal basis. Deputy Bruton has already discussed this, but the person was concerned about the use of the phrase "federal basis" compared with the 1957 Treaty of Rome which talks about ever closer union. The word "federal" seems to give people the shivers.The Deputy will say it is not intended to go in that direction but some people are concerned about the loss of national sovereignty, particularly with regard to subsidiarity. In 2001 the European Union was able to block a merger between two large American companies, GE and Honeywell. It frightened even those outside the European Union that it was capable of blocking the merger of two worldwide, although they are American, companies. I am sure it was correct to do so. However, it was that type of threat which reminded many of us of the dangers. Senator McDowell spoke about the tax harmonisation danger. It might be something we would welcome in a few years when Latvia or some other country is undercutting Ireland, but not at this stage. Will we be able to protect ourselves in the Convention and the new constitution against some of these new trends?
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Deputy John Bruton's frankness today is most refreshing. I compliment the Leader on her initiative in inviting the Deputy, Mr. De Rossa and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to come before the Seanad. If Senators are to address the problem of the democratic deficit, this is one of the ways of doing it.When the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, came before the House, I highlighted the fact that in the early days of the EEC we were able to point to many good reasons for being a member. In those days, for every £1 we paid into the EEC, we received £10 back and £9 of that went to farming. Over £8 of the £9 went to price supports. That is a relatively accurate recollection of the economic situation and the set of the relationships we had then. That is the simple way we sold it to the Irish people in the early days.Within the next couple of years, Ireland will be a net contributor to the EU so we will have a new set of relationships. Senator Quinn spoke about the language that is being used. It is difficult for ordinary people to relate to and most of them simply turn away. Is there a simple way today, given the complexities that have crept into the institutions of the EU, to put forward that same message to the people?On the last occasion, I also raised the issue of tax harmonisation. I am heartened by Deputy Bruton's response and I welcome his comments. It is too early, and I agree with the reasons he gave for his reluctance, to go down the road of tax harmonisation enthusiastically or immediately.The Deputy did not refer in his conclusion to No. 5 in the list of issues he brought before Senators. I might be wrong or I might not have heard his remarks. I would welcome his opinion on whether, in view of the need to underpin the euro, the European Commission should have a stronger role in ensuring member states do not over-inflate their economies.Earlier in his address to the House the Deputy posed the following question:Given that the European Union already has the power to strike down any tax policy that is discriminatory or constitutes unfair competition, as it struck down our manufacturing tax rate and export sales relief, what conceivable justification is there for the widespread demand, from every country except the United Kingdom and Ireland, for the introduction of qualified majority voting on tax matters in order to impose a minimum rate of corporation tax?I would welcome further elaboration on that question.I have read with interest the summary of the contributions the Deputy has made to the Convention on the Future of Europe. I am committed to the idea that the Convention will have a significant bearing on the evolution of relationships within the European Union. There is, however, much concern that the proposed new European constitution might undermine the values and rights enshrined in the Constitution. That is a fundamental issue. I do not know how easy it will be to address it but it needs to be addressed well in advance of any European constitution being put to the people.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	434	To take Senator Fitzgerald's last point, the European Union's charter of fundamental rights was drawn up to be an EU version of the European Convention on Human rights but with some additional social rights added on, including the right to free placement services, consultation in the workplace and other such matters not included in the original charter. It is likely to be introduced as part of the constitution of Europe but with the proviso that it only applies in respect of the application of European Union law. Unless the European Union was to be given competence in the area of abortion, for instance, which it does not have, there is no way that any interpretation of the charter of fundamental rights could have any effect. Furthermore, the Government has a protocol which protects the position of our current constitutional provisions on the matter. There may be other areas of our constitutional rights about which the Senator is concerned but that is a leading example.As regards the role of the Commission and the Council in ensuring countries maintain fiscal discipline, my own view is that the Commission should have more power in this matter. I did not think the Government was wise to react as negatively as it did when Commissioner Solbes said we should have run a larger surplus than planned in the 2001 budget. We would be a lot better off now if we had run a larger surplus at that stage and the Minister himself would be much better off if he had taken the European Union's advice rather than following the advice he did. That is a political point, however, upon which I do not really want to dwell.Objectively, it is right that if one is managing a currency, one has to be able to regulate the amount of money being printed. When governments run deficits, they are printing money. One cannot, therefore, manage a common currency without having some European authority that can tell people not to run deficits beyond a certain amount or, if they are running a surplus, that they should do so to a certain amount in order that when there is a deficit, they will not be in difficulty. As the present arrangements are not as effective as they ought to be, the Commission should be given more power of initiative in this area. At the end of the day, however, any such policy decision has to be taken by the Council of Ministers, not the Commission, although implementing policy is a matter for it.I regret that the word "federal" was included in the treaty but now that it is there Ireland should not be kicking up about it. It is not a constructive debate in which to become involved. If the Government was to make a big issue of this – which it is not doing – it would be akin to tilting at a windmill rather than tackling anything substantial; it would cause confusion in the public mind rather than dealing with the real issue.For the reasons I have outlined it is quite clear that the European Union is not federal. The United States was founded as a federal union in 1787 on the basis that the federation or union had the exclusive power to raise an army and run deficits. Those are two things the European Union does not have the power to do.Senator Quinn referred to people in central and eastern Europe being worried about giving up one controller in Moscow for another in Brussels. The truth of the matter is, however, that if there was no European Union, they would be swapping one controller in Moscow for another in Berlin. Germany is so big in the centre of Europe that it will dominate its surroundings. The European Union regulates the way in which big powers can exert influence over small powers, as well as big companies over small ones. The European Union has been good for Ireland because it has provided us with a mechanism whereby we can ensure the British do not throw their weight around in this part of the world. Similarly for the Poles, the European Union will ensure Germany cannot throw its weight around in that part of the world. The choice for the countries concerned, therefore, is not between Moscow and Brussels but between Moscow and Berlin. The choice for us is not between Dublin and Brussels but between London and Brussels. It is much better to have these decisions taken in Brussels or Frankfurt where we have a say than in London as they used to be when our currency rates were set by the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street.

We will decide in the Presidium which amendments are best and put an amended version to the Convention. We could not go through each one of them individually. The idea of a double majority, to which the Senator referred, instead of the complicated qualified majority voting system provided for in the Treaty of Nice, is an improvement that will take place.Concern was expressed by Senators about the cost of campaigns and the recognition of candidates in a European presidential election. First, the European parties will be funded and will, in turn, fund campaigns. They will not be funded out of individuals' pockets. Second, people living on the Aran Islands or the Peleponese know who Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac are, even though neither politician might address them in their native languages. There is, therefore, no reason people living in those areas and other parts would not know who the candidates in a European presidential election were. They would get to know them and it would be the business of the candidates to make sure they did.To answer Senator Coghlan's point, any country joining the European Union has to put 80,000 pages of European Union law onto its statute book, and all have done so. The trouble lies with enforcement. There are genuine worries, for example, about the courts system in Romania. Whatever about the Romanians accepting European Union law, will their courts be willing or able to implement it? That is the big question.We should be wary of singling out Turkey as the only country that has ever had question marks over its human rights record. Some of the legislation we have had to have on the Statute Book – including internment, which I supported at the time – would place us in some difficulty with modern thinking on human rights. We should recognise that some countries have bigger problems to deal with. We should not be unduly superior. However, if Turkey joins the European Union, it will be the country with the largest population. Within a short time its population will exceed that of Germany. If it joins, it will change the nature of the European Union in a substantial way but, on the other hand, it will be beneficial because its demographic profile is much more healthy than that of existing member states. It will not have a major pension problem because many babies are being born in that country and many young people are entering the workforce. The rest of Europe will face an appalling pension and ageing problem into the future. This is one of the issues about which the Convention can do next to nothing. Looking at the broad canvas of what is important in Europe, this is a major issue.I thank Senators very much for this opportunity and presume I must stop at this stage.

The quality of its advocacy is something about which the party can be really proud.I agree entirely with what the Deputy said on the state and super-state. He may have noticed that I deployed some of the same arguments over the past 12 months or more. Equally, I agree with his comments on federalism on which we must have some rational discussion. The reference seems to be a factual one. It is the case that monetary policy is a competence run on a federal basis. I do not see the reason we should have to put up with constantly shooting down in public debate to kingdom come Thatcherite canards by those not prepared to discuss the issue rationally.What I would really like to home in on is the discussion on the current international situation and its impact on common foreign and security policy. I saw an interesting and stimulating article which I believe was written by an American who said the United States inhabited a Hobbesian sort of world of power where the famous phrase "life is nasty, brutish and short" was used versus the post-War Kantian concept of a European confederation which is more idealistic and only resorts to use of power, certainly military power, as a last resort.It is obvious that the Iraq situation has caused serious tensions, to put it mildly, between leading countries pulling in opposition directions. It is not only a question of Britain and France being members of the UN Security Council. Britain has always based its post-War foreign policy, above all, on its special relationship with the United States which seems to take primacy over Europe whereas the French have a concept of European unity which, to a degree, is meant to be a rival to the United States. With regard to the idea of a single UN seat on the Security Council for Europe – if one was French, one could say, "C'est tres beau”– the chances of that happening or of Britain and France giving up their seats are minimal.I have two questions for the Deputy. On the assumption that his ideal of such a single UN seat is not entertained by the British and the French, how else does he see Europe acquiring a more coherent voice – that is perhaps a hypotethical question because we do not precisely what will happen – and how does he envisage we will repair the rifts? The European Union is about to expand greatly to include 25 members, perhaps more. This leads to strong suggestions, particularly on the part of larger states, that we need greater coherence and direction. There are certain dangers in this situation for small states. In the context of a union of 25 member states where it is necessary to have some coherence and direction, what is the best strategy for a small country like Ireland to maintain its influence at the maximum possible level?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I welcome Deputy John Bruton. From my brief experience in politics a significant event was the recent Nice treaty referendum. Without stealing the thunder from the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, Deputy John Bruton championed the cause in relation to that referendum.The Leader of the House in her vision in Glenties last summer – perhaps she was inspired while in county Donegal -spoke of decentralising the debate from this House. I congratulate her on doing so because it is important. Everyone of us as a political representative had to put up with a great deal of negativity and scaremongering during the last Nice treaty referendum because people felt they were disenfranchised and that there was a democratic deficit.In line with the thinking of the Leader to decentralise the debate, I would like to go a step further and bring it to local authority level as councillors are in touch with the people. They hear the person on the street ask the reason are it is becoming a bland Europeanised project, a uniform European Union. Every area should be distinct and authentic in its own right in keeping with the theory of subsidiarity.The Deputy said in one of his statements that there was a Europeanising of the European project which was in breach of subsidiarity. While that is not the language of the ordinary person, it is exactly what the ordinary person is thinking in west Clare, west Mayo or west Donegal. We should be treated differently even on an inter-regional basis nationally but also in a European context. The way to do this is to follow up the Leader's thinking on the matter on which I followed through at local authority level by putting a motion to Donegal County Council calling for the setting up of an EU sub-office to disseminate information from the European Union or perhaps even to bring European bureaucrats, or our own, to participate in each local authority on the island, as the people will be only allowed to debate the European project again come the next referendum.At the Convention there is room to debate the need for decentralising the project further. I got unanimous support from councillors across parties – Fianna Fáil, Independent Fianna Fáil and my party –  who agreed that a sub-office would be of great benefit in the dissemination of information which would enable the person who calls to the county council offices to be made aware of the tangible benefits of the European project, about which Senator Quinn spoke. I throw out that suggestion to the Deputy and would like to hear his thoughts on it.

The history of Europe shows us that such a humble mention would only inspire us to greater things. Perhaps it is the lack of such an understanding that has caused so many problems in the past. I hope in the future we can see that pure secularism is arid and sterile.Deputy Bruton should consider whether Russia and the Urals, from Vorkuta to the Caspian Sea, are also European centres. I am paraphrasing Margaret Thatcher, something I am not used to doing. Budapest, Warsaw and Prague were mentioned as European centres when the Iron Curtain still existed, but there seems to be an acceptance that Russia will not be included and will remain separate to the rest of the European community. That is not the correct way to deal with Europe. We must engage with and embrace Russia, which is a huge and marvellous country comprised of 11 time zones. It is part of Europe and we must try to include it within the European Union.As functions are decentralised – the Ariane rocket, for example, is launched from French Guyana – would it not be proper if the Third World aid office was decentralised from Brussels to Dublin? We are in a unique situation: we have never had colonies and we have excellent Third World relations. We would be uniquely placed for any such decentralisation and Deputy Bruton should consider that.

We used to be top of the league and were recognised as good Europeans, but we have fallen away. We have lost ownership of the European concept. One of today's newspapers details a serious development as a result of the current determination of America to go to war, which seems to have led to new alignments of States within Europe for and against war. The fallout may be that Irish diplomats and representatives dealing with the Fischler reforms will lose some of their supporters when it comes to securing certain reforms because of these realignments. Deputy Bruton should comment on this.I welcome Deputy Bruton's suggestion that the Convention should deal with the possibility of an arm of the Irish Legislature, such as the Seanad, having the opportunity to challenge some European laws. That is one reason the electorate has lost confidence in Europe. We all recognise the positive aspects of Europe, such as the funding Ireland receives, but such positive impressions can be lost. There is a need for reform and for people to have a tangible input. If the Seanad could challenge some EU laws and directives, as Deputy Bruton suggested, there would be more tangible recognition among the electorate of such an input. The same goes for his suggestion regarding the direct election of a President; that could be another carrot to entice the electorate to get involved in Europe.Deputy Bruton said it could be possible for the EU to direct the British Government to close Sellafield. If that happened as a result of European input, it would be very welcome—

I know of his commitment to Europe.Deputy Bruton mentioned the EURATOM Treaty and I agree with him that questions could be raised regarding the closure of unsafe nuclear facilities. I understand this treaty is to be reviewed, but I am concerned that treatment of the nuclear industry is too preferential. I have asked on previous occasions if there is any possibility of emphasising and supporting alternative energy sources, as we are all conscious of the Kyoto Protocol and there has been much talk of green taxes. Alternative energy sources should be supported.Deputy Bruton discussed how the European Parliament should be elected, referring to PR, the list system and the first past the post system. Constituency boundaries are a major issue now, particularly in light of the review of those boundaries. Connacht-Ulster is a huge three seater constituency, stretching from Malin Head to the Clare border, and could be bigger again after the next revision. Has any thought been given to reducing constituencies to two or one-seaters? At present, the constituencies are huge.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I welcome Deputy John Bruton and compliment him on his excellent presentation. I also compliment the Leader for organising his visit.Deputy Bruton has always pushed for a genuine union of people rather than institutions within Europe, something I have always appreciated. Since we joined the EU 30 years ago, some politicians have blamed Europe for bureaucracy, red tape and various directives. This has resulted in citizens becoming suspicious of Europe on certain issues.Irish sovereignty should be thoroughly debated in a manner which engages citizens. It is important for the nation that we arrive at a common understanding of how we perceive our sovereignty in a more integrated Europe. We should commence this vital process now, rather than in the lead-up to a Dublin treaty. I ask Deputy John Bruton to outline his views in this regard.On the question of the closeness of the institutions to the people, Article 1 of the Treaty of Rome refers to bringing Europe closer to its citizens. Senator McHugh raised several issues concerning the involvement of local and regional government. Will the Convention on the Future of Europe adopt the European charter on local self-government? The charter should be incorporated into a European constitution, treaty or convention at the earliest opportunity as it focuses on bringing the institutions closer to the people.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	446	My apologies for my misunderstanding as regards the time of this debate. I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to the points made by Senators.Senator Mansergh is correct that persuading the French and British to give up their seats on the Security Council would be extremely difficult. While I am not aware of any serious efforts to push such a possibility, it is a logical position. Current events demonstrate the need to exert pressure in that direction as it would at least have the beneficial effect of making France and Britain realise that some people question their right to sit on the Security Council. They should show greater willingness to work within the context of the European Union, rather than escaping EU control by consistently relying on the argument that their ability to use a veto in New York means they do not have to listen to anyone in Brussels.In noting that France and Britain would never give up their Security Council seats, Senator Mansergh asked what would be the next best thing. The European Union should return to the model which ultimately led to the construction of the Common Market, namely, the European Coal and Steel Community. By making countries interdependent as far as the sinews of war were concerned, the establishment of the ECSC ensured they could not go to war again.We need to take a similar approach by establishing a European armaments agency. The creation of one agency with one method of purchasing arms for the various armies in the Europe would make countries mutually dependent and allow them to specialise in different military tasks. This would build structural interdependence, out of which would grow a common approach to issues on which one might have to contemplate the use of means of control. Apart from learning from the colossal mistakes we, in Europe, are currently making, I cannot think of a better approach.The Senator also asked how a small country can maximise its influence. Like Hertz, we must always try harder with the larger countries. We cannot afford to relax.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I was going to say Superquinn. My message, in other words, is that one must have higher quality representation, which is the reason Superquinn came to mind. I do not mean to be critical of our public administration, but it is probably unavoidable. Its approach to European affairs must become less reactive, defensive and focused on identifying potential problems for us in proposals emanating from the European Union. It must try to invest our interest in a common European interest, in other words, to create a European interest under which our interest can develop, rather than taking a negative approach in which we reject this, that and the other. We need to be more creative.My criticism is not so much levelled at the current Government as at the way in which people think about the European Union. There is, for example, a tendency here to react. This is probably due to low staffing levels in the Department of Foreign Affairs, which means people are stretched and can only deal with urgent matters. As a result, they do not have time to be as creative as they should be.We need to harness our resources to be ahead of the game at all times. We must develop European solutions to problems which also happen to suit Ireland, as opposed to Irish objections to European solutions proposed by other member states. This approach should be summarised and pinned to the walls in Iveagh House, Merrion Street and other Departments.With regard to Senator McHugh's comments, membership of the European Community has not created a uniform Europe. If, for example, one was to trace the flowering of Irish music, one would find it blossomed around the same time we joined the European Economic Community. Although there is not necessarily a connection between the two developments, the distinctiveness of Ireland has become more visible since we joined the EEC. When we were inward looking, others did not know much about us and were not particularly interested in us because we were so preoccupied with ourselves. As a member of the European Union, interest in Ireland has grown and we have developed a greater sense of ourselves due to the strong contact we now have with other countries. This would never have come about had we continued to direct our dialogue inwards. Europe should not be regarded as a threat in this regard.I thank Senator Hanafin for his reference to—

The wording we proposed with regard to the question of including a reference to God in the proposed constitution is entirely non-sectarian. It includes people who do not believe in God as well as believers from the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. I find it difficult to understand the reasons for the objections to the proposal. It is almost as if the people concerned have a problem accepting that other people believe in God. Perhaps they feel it is somehow wrong to acknowledge that others believe when they do not. The intolerance that used to be expressed by believers has been adopted by non-believers who have become as intolerant as believers ever were. I discovered this in the few weeks since I made my proposal and, while it should not have been the case, I was surprised.I acknowledge the serious point made by Senator Ulick Burke about the potential effect of current divisions in Europe on the negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy. I hope his concerns are not realised.Senator Kitt is correct that there is preferential treatment for nuclear power. There is also preferential treatment with regard to the state aid regime and the research budget. Under current arrangements, nuclear power does not have to compete with other energy sources on the same basis. From our point of view, a renegotiation of the EURATOM Treaty is an opportunity to correct some of these matters. However, we will not be able to halt the production of nuclear power in Europe. We can at least ensure that it competes on a level basis with other possible energy sources, which it does not do under current arrangements. That is why it is worth raising the issue.As far as constituencies for the European Parliament are concerned – I do not know whether Senator Kitt is contemplating standing for election – I believe two-seaters are about as low as one can go. I am not sure if Members are aware that Spain is a single constituency in terms of elections to the European Parliament. Furthermore, the candidates are selected by the party leaders. A Spanish MEP who is anywhere near the top of the list need not worry about any voter other than his or her party leader.

I will investigate whether there is any recognition of that charter in the European Union. As the Senator is aware, that is a Council of Europe charter, which has a different provenance to the European Union, but there is no reason it cannot be considered to be something we would at least work towards in the European Union. I will take the matter up as result of what the Senator said.The Senator is correct also in saying there is a tendency to blame Europe for measures that Ministers, on many occasions, agree to indirectly. Many actions taken in Brussels are not taken by the European Commission but by management committees and various other committees on which the Irish Government is represented. However, many of the people who represent Ireland on those committees have been members for years, do not tell their Ministers what they are doing, agree to measures and then, when the decision comes to be implemented, blame Brussels when it was the people representing Ireland, Spain, Italy, France and all the other countries who agreed to these measures.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I would like to express the gratitude of the House to Deputy John Bruton for his thoughtful and topical address, which gave rise to a lively debate.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I move:That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to introduce urgent measures to bring down the cost of motor insurance for young drivers.I am grateful for the opportunity to bring this matter before the House. I had hoped that because the motion was phrased in such non-contentious terms it might not have been subject to an amendment from the Government. I had no ambition to put down a motion which is contentious or adversarial. I hoped it would be agreed so that we could go away with a joint resolve to act in the interests of young drivers.I am disappointed by the Government amendment because I had thought the placing of this subject in the programme for Government as a matter of great urgency to both parties was genuine. This amendment indicates that the delay we have witnessed already in bringing down the price of premiums, which has not happened, may be an indicator that we will not see much action on this issue in the lifetime of the Government. Some of the initiatives referred to in the amendment may become instruments of delay and I am disappointed in that regard.Car insurance is a particularly special product for one reason, that is, it is compulsory. Everybody who wants to hold a driving licence is compelled by law to go to privately run insurance companies, which are under very little compulsion by law. That may make me sound like some sort of an interventionist in the free market, which I have always have been – although Senator O'Toole may not be – but when people do not have any choices, the Government has the option to police this area properly and ensure it does not exploit the those who are compelled to be part of that process. Car insurance is an example of where people have been exploited by one of the great cartels. It is different from the banks, which benefit as cartels from the inertia of their customers and from the fact that none of us like to switch around because of laziness, fear, culture, cost and other complicated reasons. However, it is not the same in the case of car insurance.Everybody who wants car insurance has to get a licence. What does that mean in modern Ireland and in the current situation? It means that young people, who are the most vulnerable, are being exploited. Young men and women are being exploited in different ways by the insurance companies. The premiums they pay are extremely high by any global or European standards.Nobody will maintain that, in statistical terms, young men in particular are not the most dangerous group of drivers. As everybody has seen, the statistics show that what are called the responsibility rates for young drivers – particularly young males – are extremely high. The second highest responsibility rates are among young women. The insurance companies have seized upon these responsibility rates and have imprinted them on the public mind so successfully that they have been able to punish these young people with exorbitant rates, proportionately far higher than the number of accidents which they cause, according to the statistics. The safest group is older women, the second safest group is the middle aged, the third is younger women and young men are the most dangerous. Statistically, the situation is now such that insurance companies and the public can justify penalising young drivers to such an extent that they cannot get insurance. I do not think this is justified.Insurance companies are exempt from the Equal Status Act, rightly or wrongly, and the criteria which they use are age, gender, class – a job, in other words, which is class to some extent – and location. I suggest they ought to use the safety record as the priority in respect of a young person. The age criterion which they use is an extraordinarily crude instrument. What about the young men and the young women who have seven years of safe records? That is possible for a 25 year old. Those people are being penalised for the very dangerous people who are in that group. That is unfair. Those people should not have to pay for the excesses of other young people or of older people. There a lot of very dangerous drivers amongst the aged and the middle aged.The Irish Farmers Journal recently published a table giving the example of a 24 year old man with a provisional licence who went to various insurance companies. The first company, AXA, refused him on the grounds that he should be over 25 years of age. Eagle Star and First Call Direct refused to give him a quote because he was under 27 years of age. Quinn Direct accepted him and quoted €4,000 third party fire and theft. This is ridiculous. The company asked only for his age. Hibernian and One Direct did not quote as he did not have four years no claims bonus. FBD does not quote for provisional licence holders. There are various other issues involved there such as whether provisional licence holders should be allowed to drive at all.If one took the example of a young woman in that situation she would receive more quotes but her quotations would certainly be higher than the value of the car. This is serious discrimination. If one were to use the example there of someone who had a full licence the person would receive more quotes but the premiums would be utterly unacceptable. The result of this is that young people who have to drive have to borrow money and get into debt to get insurance, which is current expenditure, thus putting themselves into a very difficult financial situation.The statistics that I have seem to show that a young man with a provisional licence is only a third more likely to have an accident for which he is liable than an old woman, who is in the lowest risk category. That would indicate that his premium should be about a third higher than hers. This is not the case. His premium is significantly higher.That is a very brief summary of the problems, and the victims and groups who are suffering under this regime. The difficulty is that this problem has existed for a very long time. It has been discussed but a solution is difficult to find in what is supposedly a free market, yet there are things which could be done immediately which might force insurance companies to reduce premiums or which might allow more competition in the market. The first is to improve driving standards. I welcome the Government's decision to introduce penalty points. That is part of the amendment, which is absolutely unnecessary, but that initiative is something on which I think we all agree. It has reduced the number of accidents and will continue to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities. It is an initiative which has taken courage and has worked very quickly. This type of problem needs to be tackled with the sort of courage with which the Minister for Transport has tackled the penalty points issue.The alcohol limit should be reduced to zero, certainly in the case of provisional drivers. That probably will not happen because of the strength of the alcohol lobby group. Provisional drivers should not be on the roads. Costs should be cut in this industry, for example, legal costs constitute about 42% of the claims made by insurance companies. The compensation culture, whereby people make fraudulent claims and get huge sums of money, should be reduced but above all there should be competition in the market.Everyone here knows that this issue has been referred to the Competition Authority. No doubt the Minister of State will mention that in his speech. The Competition Authority will report on this issue in a year's time at the earliest and when it reports some think tank will be set up to consider it and it will come before some committees of the Oireachtas. It will be another two or three years before legislation is introduced and although the MIAB reported on the issue over a year ago there will be five years between that report and legislation.We do not need a Competition Authority report. This issue has already been tackled. What we do need is more competition in the market – I wish I had time to elaborate on this – so that the insurance companies could not run this extraordinarily privileged cartel which allows them to charge people who are compelled by the Government to have insurance.I regret and oppose the amendment. I applaud some of the sentiments in it but not the action in it. I oppose it particularly because of one sentence, "recognising the serious implications of the events of September 11th in the US for the global insurance industry particularly the costs of re-insurance". What has that got to do with motor insurance? That is an apology for the activities of the insurance industry and I do not want to hear this or any other Government apologising for this industry which has had its own way for too long. For that reason alone I would oppose the amendment. I hope that this debate will prompt urgent, constructive measures from the Government, not waffle about how they share the sentiments which I have expressed.Senator Joe O'Toole, who incidentally has been appointed to the PIAB and we should congratulate him, will second the motion.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I second the motion. I wish to make a formal declaration of interest, since I am member of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.I very much share Senator Ross's view that it was entirely unnecessary to table an amendment. I agree that we should make no excuse for the insurance industry. I have seen surveys showing that insurance costs have risen far higher in Europe, including Ireland, than they have in the US since the 11 September 2001 attacks. I see re-insurance companies go out of business, and we all know what Swiss Three went through in the first few months afterwards. However, we also know what they have done for the past 50 years and what they will do for the next 50. They are not in the risk business. One of the reasons we need this kind of debate and these kinds of decisions is that insurance companies, despite the popular view, are not open, liable or exposed to risk. They do not operate by taking chances. They cover others' risks without accepting any themselves. They work out the cost of providing people's insurance, and to those costs are added the administrative costs and the profit. That is how they work out the premium.That simple list is important because there is no great pressure on insurance companies to reduce costs. It makes no difference to their bottom lines. The higher the premia, the greater their percentage increases will be. If they have a vested interest in any direction, it is in the way things are currently moving. I say that not in any accusatory way, for it is a statement of fact. We must ask ourselves how to approach the issue. If I work backwards taking the points raised in the Government amendment, I find myself in agreement with 99%. The line about the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks is the only one that could easily be dropped, for I do not see why we need make that excuse for the insurance companies.The problem stems from the costs: the compensation paid per accident, the cost to whomever when someone has an accident. Every step of that way, a cost control is required to bring Ireland into line with other countries. When I say "cost control", I do not mean "price control", for the largest element of cost in accidents is legal. Any number of surveys have been conducted, and statistics are available from all sorts of viewpoints – from Deloitte & Touche in 1996 up to IBEC in 2001 – showing that legal costs in settling accident claims account for somewhere between 25% and 50% of the total. In many cases, the legal costs are higher than the net award. We cannot live with that reality.For that reason, I hope that the Minister will dismiss out of hand the self-serving report that the legal profession commissioned to stop any useful movement by the Government to make accident settlements cheaper. It does not stand up to inspection. If someone wishes to write such a report, I want to see it paid for and carried out by a person with no vested interest whatever. All the questions can be answered. There is no free market. One of the great conundrums about this is, if insurance companies in Ireland are so profitable, why all the other insurance companies in Europe do not set up business here now that we are all together in the euro zone. The reason is that, when they see the mess that we have here, they will not come near us. On the Continent, in most cases, if a person has an accident, certain things click into place. There is firmly established pay-related social insurance covering loss of earnings and so on, meaning that it does not form part of the claim. The general medical system of the country will pick up almost all of the medical costs. Those two cost elements are therefore removed.We could be starting to deal with those issues. The PIAB is currently examining them regarding personal accidents, excepting motor insurance, to develop a model. The next step for the PIAB would be to deal with motor insurance. We are taking this route because we know there will be legal resistance against every move to make the marketplace more liberal or easier for customers. The other huge issue that we have never addressed is the method by which people are compensated, even allowing for the form of compensation. In every other country that I have examined, there is a book of quantum that, crude as it may sound, allows a range of compensation for whatever type of injury a person suffers, be it the loss of a limb, an eye or a finger. People work on that basis.I will now state how a new system might work, tying in with what Senator Ross has said. If we could deal with those matters, we could say to someone who has, for example, suffered a serious accident resulting in a limp that he or she can go to court to fight, with a likely sum of compensation falling within a certain range. The person can, however, make a deal to receive that sum now. If he or she is happy, and both sides sign up, we have effectively halved the costs. That is a possibility, and the PIAB is starting to develop such strategies regarding general accidents. It is its intention to examine them in motor insurance too. Dorothea Dowling, the chair of that group, is determined to fight against any obstacles that come our way, as are the other board members.I thank and congratulate Senator Ross for tabling the motion. I hope that I have touched on one or two ways in which the Government can encourage progress. On the basis of what Senator Ross said, it would be appropriate to accept our motion. It does not in any way undermine the Government's position; it has not even criticised it. Our aim was to achieve a co-ordinated view, with us all working together. We must give the Government the necessary support to realise that. I urge Members to accept the motion and Senator Leyden not to move the amendment.

I would like us to agree on a motion of the House so that there is no division. I accept the bona fides of both speakers and appreciate that they are endeavouring to effect changes.I recognise the motivation behind the Senators' motion, which I believe is generally acceptable to the House. The Government, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and her Department are making tremendous efforts to try to tackle this issue, which is a priority. The attacks on 11 September 2001 were an international tragedy that affected everyone and I accept Senator O'Toole's point that they have been used by insurance companies here as an excuse for increasing costs. I call on the Senators who moved the original motion to indicate if they agree to the amendment it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I have discussed it with Senator O'Toole and we are both very happy with this.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am delighted and very grateful. Both Senators have made a great contribution.Everyone is concerned about this fundamental issue which affects young people in particular and is the source of the greatest number of representations made to Members of the Oireachtas. I previously served as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce. Although I did not have direct responsibility for the relevant section of the Department, I am aware that this area has always given rise to major difficulties and successive Governments have tried to tackle it in many ways.The recent contribution by the Minister for Transport has had an enormous effect on reducing the level of fatalities on the roads. Although this should be reflected in a reduction in motor insurance costs, that is not always the case. Some years ago there was an agreement that there would no longer be two senior counsels and a junior counsel appearing in court cases and I believe legislation was passed. While this was supposed to lead to a major reduction in the cost of premiums, unfortunately it did not do so.While the insurance market in Ireland is not very competitive, it is also not very profitable. It is difficult to discover what are the profit margins of insurance companies. As Members are aware, the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and the Department are examining this issue. Between 2000 and 2002, the previous joint committee met representatives of many organisations. While the current joint committee deals with insurance in the broad sense, it also deals with motor insurance particularly for young people.The Motor Insurance Advisory Board report on reforms of the motor insurance market published on 17 April 2002 made 67 recommendations. The Government accepted the report's findings and took steps to implement the recommendations. Since then, work to drive forward the Government's insurance market reform programme has included: the appointment of a cross-departmental industrial implementation group; the publication of the MIAB action plan; the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by the Tánaiste and incorporating the briefs of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to oversee implementation of the MIAB recommendations; and the establishment of an interim Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, chaired by Dorothea Dowling, author of the MIAB report.I congratulate our colleague, Senator O'Toole, on his appointment to the interim committee. He brings to it tremendous experience through his role as a Senator and his work with the INTO and as president of ICTU. I am delighted we are showing faith in our elected representatives and people of the calibre of Senator O'Toole, or any other Senator, are not seen to be unsuitable because of membership of the Oireachtas.

#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I was delighted when the list was published and issued to us at the committee. Who has more experience of dealing with legislation than Members of the Oireachtas? The appointment brings to that organisation a direct link between it and the Oireachtas and the experience gained by Senator O'Toole will be made available to the House.Other Government initiatives in this area include: a joint study by the Competition Authority and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment into the insurance sector to identify anti-competitive practices and other constraints in competition in the non-life insurance market, with particular reference to motor insurance, employers' liability and public liability insurance; and the establishment of an Independent Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, under the aegis of the Department of Finance, to improve financial regulations and look after the interests of consumers.The details of the insurance industry are well known to the public. The total premiums from motor insurance for 2001 came to nearly €1.7 billion or 1.5% of the gross domestic product. Ireland has the highest litigious population, with significant court awards. There was a 14% rise to 8,323 in the number of personal injury cases started in the High Court in 2001. In the same year, the High Court disposed of 9,323 personal injury cases and had 10,744 cases in hand. Third party motor insurance is compulsory and differs from many other products or services in that there is a limit on consumers' ability to not purchase or to substitute cheaper alternatives.As I should have said at the outset, I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, who is well aware of the insurance situation. Given that the Tánaiste is directly involved with this issue, I have great confidence. She has taken quick action on the report and has implemented it in full. She is conscious of the effect of insurance costs on everyone.Insurance costs can be reduced in many ways. The number of accidents can be reduced, which is why the action taken by the Minister for Transport has been so effective. Some people advocate a levy or special tax on fuel that would go towards reducing the cost of motor insurance for young people in particular. It is one of the most pressing issues facing this and previous Governments. However, it was not resolved by any previous Administration. It has been debated at numerous Ógra Fianna Fáil and Young Fine Gael conferences. Nobody has come up with a magic formula.I thank Senators and O'Toole for tabling this motion. I am delighted to have agreement on the wording of this proposal, which will go to the Government. I appreciate the contributions already made and look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.

He is very busy and is spending more time here than in the Lower House. He is acting in substitution up for all sorts of Ministers, including the Tánaiste. I compliment Senators and O'Toole on their motion and I compliment Senator Leyden for his initiative in proposing the amendment. I agree with Senators Ross and O'Toole that there is no need for division in the House.I congratulate Senator O'Toole. It is wonderful that one of our own has been appointed to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to which he will bring a wealth of experience. He has done a wonderful job in other review groups. I fought against the exclusion of politicians from boards because there are many in the Oireachtas with specialist expertise. Senator O'Toole is a case in point. He cuts through the waffle and self-serving antics of the vested interests and cartels that we all want to see disturbed. He mentioned the book of quantum; crude as it might seem, Robert Pierse, the eminent Listowel solicitor, produced such a book a few years back.The motion is timely and touches on a most pressing need because high insurance costs impinge on many in the workforce. Unfortunately, statistics for injuries and fatalities are appalling, although figures have declined recently. There are many contributory factors – excessive speed, not wearing a seat belt and drink driving, among others. Young drivers are very vulnerable and their insurance costs are huge. Anything that can reduce them should be welcomed.There is no doubt this is linked to the lifestyle of young males and peer pressure. Dr. Ray Fuller of Trinity College Dublin examined the psychology of the young driver. In his report, Human Factors Related to Speeding, he wrote of a high risk driving style and an overestimation of the ability to drive safely. Young drivers are not good at reading the road for hazards in the distance. Statistics bear out they are more prone to accidents than any other group.The crucial issue of reducing motor insurance premiums for young drivers was examined in some detail in the Deloitte & Touche report, An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland. It found that premium rates for them are high in all EU countries relative to the rates charged to more mature drivers, reflecting the significantly higher risk they represent to the insurance companies providing cover. The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver was over twice that for the 36 to 40 year age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 year age group were responsible for over three and a half times the average claim costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.The report considered spreading premium rates more evenly across the different risk categories of motorists and concluded that reducing the premiums for young motorists at the expense of increasing premiums for the more mature and safer motorist would reduce the incentive to drive safely. It concluded that the solution to lowering premiums for young drivers was to improve their driving standards and accident claim records.The introduction of the penalty points system has improved matters. It is hoped yesterday's damaging leak will not cause any setbacks because we have already seen signs of improvement. There will be 60 or 70 more people enjoying the St. Patrick's Day festivities this year than would otherwise be the case.Senator Leyden mentioned the work of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. I am honoured to be a member of that committee and know it is concerned about this matter. It has been considering the Government's programme of reforms for the insurance market. Matters are moving slowly but I hope there will be more of an impetus as result of this motion.The committee is concerned about some of the key issues: the link between the rating of premiums and claim costs for young people; the greater frequency and cost of accidents caused by young drivers; the impact of premium costs on all drivers; concerns that young drivers are paying higher premiums because of the sins of the few and that young female drivers, in particular, are subsidising other age groups; international comparison of premium and claim costs, particularly the lower cost of insurance in Britain and the checks and balances there for road safety and claim processing.There are many points the committee will address. The Tánaiste, motoring and insurance organisations have appeared before it and more meetings are planned. We all want this work to bear fruit.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. He has had a rough couple of days here – we should make him an honorary Senator for the amount of time he has spent in the House. With this motion he is back on home ground, dealing with a most important topic. I welcome the motion and I am glad there is agreement on the amendment. Given the challenge that faces us in reintroducing a degree of normality to the insurance industry, we must show unity in this area.I am disappointed that there was no mention of the effects of insurance costs on small businesses. It is easy to be dismissive of the reasons behind these costs but we must acknowledge that the changed world market has dictated huge increases.The issue of young drivers is before us. There were problems in this sector before the changes in the insurance market. The increases of the last two years might have been far greater than in the previous two years but even before 11 September 2001 the issue was widely discussed. As a parent of two young sons who are car drivers, I certainly share these concerns, given that parents normally have to pick up the costs. We also have to recognise the actuarial figures placed before us and the way in which the insurance industry has operated in terms of pooling people, and even professions, as being in a high risk category. In the case of medical insurance, there is a far greater spread of insurance costs throughout the entire field of those insured, whereas there has been a somewhat selective approach by the motor insurance industry.In relation to the motion before the House, I also share the concerns of young people. We have to recognise that in present day society a car is no longer a luxury but rather a necessity for many, having regard to travel to employment and even educational centres. Many third level students are driving to college each day. That is not necessarily a luxury but a response to accommodation costs. I know many families which have made a conscious decision that it is cheaper for them to invest in transport for their children between home and college, rather than having to bear the accommodation costs of living away from home. Those are some of the realities of life today. We need to get away from the idea that it is a luxury for young people to drive. It is becoming a necessity for the reasons I have outlined.The Government set about a task in the programme for Government in recognising the difficulties in the insurance industry and made it very clear that reform was needed. In bringing forward reform one cannot confine it to a single approach. A number of actions are necessary to bring about proper reform, some of which have been mentioned by previous speakers. In An Agreed Programme for Government it was acknowledged that the MIAB action plan, with its 67 recommendations, would be implemented. Other speakers have commented on Senator O'Toole's appointment to the PIAB and I share their views. It was one of those boards from which we chose not to ban the appointment of Members of the Oireachtas, whereas we have taken a different approach to others. I welcome his appointment and believe he will bring the same energy to the position as he does to debates in this House.With regard to the Competition Authority, it is necessary – I heard Senator Ross's comments – to examine the whole area of competition. In relation to the Senator's comments to the effect that there would be more reports, findings and sub-committees, that has not been the approach since we set about this reform. The action which has taken place between October of last year, when the Tánaiste's initiatives were brought forward, to its implementation in the earlier part of this year, shows the urgency the Government has placed on this, including the adoption of reports as they come through. However, we must avoid the danger of getting bogged down in reports.We also have to consider the role of the legal profession in driving costs so high, particularly in areas of undisputed liability. It is incredible that in such cases we still have to go through an elaborate legal process. Undoubtedly, that is a major factor in driving costs through the roof. My point is that a number of different approaches to the situation are required. The Government has set about these approaches in the correct manner. Legal reform is essential and there must be compensation boards where awards can be made without any issue of liability. The awards must be in keeping with common standards, particularly in the courts. I am confident the approach being adopted by the Government will bring about major reform and a reduction in costs. We are getting a positive response from the insurance industry. However, we must not rule out any one element of the tasks taken on by the Government, each one of which has a role to play in terms of leading to a more balanced insurance industry and better value for the consumer.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I approach this debate from a rather different angle from that of other speakers. I have been directly affected by this issue since I started driving some seven years ago. The discriminatory practices rampant in the insurance industry over several years are no surprise to anybody at the receiving end. Ms Dorothea Dowling, the author of that splendid report from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, confirmed what we already knew. As Senator Ross eloquently pointed out, young people were not even being quoted in many cases and in others the quotations were preconditioned in terms of a number of years driving experience with a no claims bonus. How can a young driver seeking a first quote possibly satisfy a precondition requiring three or four years accident free driving experience? Clearly, there were many issues involved.When the board was established, it was regrettable that the Minister of State concerned at the time, Deputy Treacy, did not place it on a statutory basis. Consequently, witnesses were not compelled to attend and give evidence. In the absence of the insurance companies from that forum, the board still delivered a very detailed and wide ranging report. Not surprisingly, when the 67 recommendations were made public, the insurance companies raised their heads above the parapet and criticised various aspects. If they had such concerns, why did they not think it worthwhile to participate when invited to do so by the State?As Senator Minihan has rightly stated, third level students are driving cars to and from college to avoid the costs associated with living away from home. In rural areas, in particular, the use of a car is an absolute necessity. As motor insurance is a legal requirement, insurance companies were taking advantage of young people and abusing them by quoting absolutely exorbitant insurance premiums. It was most unfair that that situation continued for so long. One effect was that young people were buying cars valued, in many cases, at a fraction of the cost of the insurance premiums, thereby giving rise to serious implications in terms cheap cars of a very poor standard, with consequent road safety hazards. That is an unthinkable effect of excessively high insurance costs.When the report emerged last April, one had to be impressed by all of its 67 recommendations. At the time one of the fears was that it would be left to lie on the shelf, as in the case of many other reports. Fortunately, that has not been the case but implementation has not been fast enough. We must bring an end to the absolutely blatant discrimination which young people have experienced in relation to motor insurance costs.In its report the MIAB identified three main vested interests in the motor insurance sector which had contributed to the outlandish premiums being quoted and charged to young people. The first comprised those involved in the business to make a profit. The second included those involved in litigation, the cost of which increased compensation claims by 40% which could be directly attributed to those involved in the litigation process. It is clear, therefore, that the  status quo was benefiting those involved in litigation significantly. The third was the Government which was receiving the 2% levy by way of stamp duty on premiums.We must be realistic and responsible in the approach being taken and do it quickly. We must arrive at a position where it shall no longer be the case that the people are paying more for motor insurance than those elsewhere in Europe.There are other sectors affected such as the small business sector, about which our colleague, Senator White, could tell us. Anyone involved in small business will tell one about the crippling costs of insurance such as public liability insurance which are forcing people out of business. It is time for us to arrest this trend.This was a major issue at the time of the general election. Any of us who stood for election received many representations from small business people forced to shed jobs and tell workers that if the situation continued, he or she would not have a job for them. The insurance sector, in its entirety, was introducing prices way above and beyond the means of those being asked to pay. That was deplorable.In setting up the Personal Injuries Assessment Board the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, made a very wise choice in selecting as chairperson Ms Dorothea Dowling, chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. With her expertise and forensic analytical mind, I am sure the board will be as successful as the one she chaired in a previous incarnation.Insurance companies are unconscionable. They do not realise, or certainly do not want to be made aware of, the hardship they are imposing, on young males in particular. I recall that when I first started driving, there was a certain policy available for women. At that stage the policy for an 18 year old female with a full licence included a large deduction not available to a male in similar circumstances because it was presumed that women were safer drivers than men. When Ms Dowling went looking for this information, it was not forthcoming. The insurance companies stated they were the statistics. When asked to show the figures which had led them to that conclusion, they could not do so. One would have to draw the logical conclusion that the assumption was unfounded.The problems faced by the board in its deliberation were far-reaching. Seeking the co-operation of the insurance industry was like "pulling teeth," to quote Ms Dowling. That is deplorable. Any sector behaving in such a manner leaves much to be desired. It is disgraceful the way in which the young male has been victimised and penalised by insurance companies.At some stage in the process to sort out this horrendous discriminatory behaviour in the insurance sector the young people, young males in particular, who have paid above and beyond what by any stretch of the imagination would be regarded as affordable insurance premia should receive a rebate. It is disgraceful to hear the figures called out by Senator Ross. Some insurance companies were not quoting while others were quoting premiums of €6,000 or €7,000. It is a scandal. It is a bad lookout for any civilised form of democracy.I am grateful to the Independent Senators for tabling this motion because I had intended to raise this issue the next time the Labour Party had use of Private Members' time. I was disappointed to see a Government amendment but thankfully it has been clarified, through consultation, with the proposer and seconder of the motion.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I commend Senators Ross, O'Toole and Norris for putting this motion before the House and I am delighted to be here to contribute to the debate.I accept that there are difficulties with regard to young drivers seeking motor insurance. Like most public representatives, I receive a constant stream of representations from young people who are seeking motor insurance and having difficulties in obtaining a reasonable quotation, or in some cases receiving a quotation at all. Unfortunately, there are difficulties across all areas of insurance, from motor insurance to employers' liability insurance and public liability insurance. Increased insurance costs now constitute a major threat to the existence of some companies and have serious ramifications for the economy in general.Many reasons, both domestic and international, have been brought forward by the insurance industry for the increases in insurance premiums. These include the number of accidents, the cost of settling claims, the requirement to strengthen insurance reserves, lower investment returns and the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States.Extensive studies have been done over several years of the cost of insurance here, notably that done recently by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, report of which was published in April last year. There is general acceptance of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations contained in the report. Following its publication, a high level implementation group was set up and mandated to draw up an action plan for the implementation of the 67 recommendations contained in it. It is the most comprehensive study and analysis of the motor insurance industry ever undertaken and provides a sound basis for addressing the problems we are experiencing in the industry. The analysis, conclusions and recommendations extend to other areas of liability insurance also. The report contains 67 recommendations covering a broad spectrum of activities which impact on the insurance market.This was the first Motor Insurance Advisory Board to secure access to insurers' raw data on premium income and claims costs, on which detailed analyses are presented in the report. It pulled no punches in contending that vested interests and inefficiencies may have collectively accounted for as much as half the premium paid by law-abiding motorists. It further confirmed that the cost of insurance was determined by three main factors: accidents, in terms of both their frequency and severity; the cost of claims within the current compensation system, and the operation of the insurance market. All of these factors have to be tackled in order to achieve better value for money for policyholders. While there is clearly room for further improvement in our safety record, significant progress has already been made, particularly since the introduction by the Minister for Transport of a penalty points system for speeding offences.The following are some of the major findings in the report: motor insurance premiums in Ireland comprise 1.6% of GDP; litigation costs – legal and expert fees – add 40% to every €1 paid in compensation for injuries sustained in motor accidents; young male drivers, aged 17 to 20 years, on provisional licences produce very substantial insurance losses – they are involved in many accidents, resulting in the most serious of claims at a frequency disproportionate to their representation as policyholders; charges for young female policyholders are not justified by their claims costs – such policyholders have been described by insurers as "subsidisers"; the consequences of uninsured driving are becoming more acute, with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland estimating that they add 8% annually to the cost of claims in the aggregate motor insurance market; the market for private motor insurance is not competitive, a situation compounded by the fact that motor insurance is compulsory, thereby limiting the usual market forces dictated by consumers – the level of mergers reduced 17 separate motor insurers in 1993 to just five in 2001, some of which operate under various product images, without the identity of the insurer being apparent to consumers; and vested interests and inefficiencies may collectively account for as much as half the premium paid by the law-abiding motorist.The Government considered the report and provided for the establishment of a group to advance implementation of the recommendations contained in it. The group comprised senior personnel from the responsible Departments and representatives of IBEC and the Consumers Association of Ireland as well as the chairman of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The group drew up an action plan that specified the measures needed to give effect to the recommendations and set out a target time frame in respect of each of them. The plan provides a precise road map for their implementation. It identifies the stakeholder responsible for delivery of each recommendation and includes a statement of the time frame for implementation. Most importantly, it provides a projection of the expected impact on claims and other costs.An Agreed Programme for Government contains a comprehensive set of commitments aimed at tackling the high costs of insurance, particularly motor insurance but also other types of liability cover. These include measures to improve road safety and driver behaviour, reduce the legal cost of accident claims and make the insurance market more consumer-friendly. The emphasis is on a co-ordinated set of actions across a range of Departments.On 25 October last the Tánaiste announced the programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the insurance market. Key measures include: establishment of a ministerial committee chaired by the Tánaiste to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the MIAB report; publication of the action plan to give effect to its recommendations within a target time frame; the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis pending preparation of the necessary legislation to place it on a statutory footing; and publication of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB.Insurance reform is regarded by the Tánaiste as her number one political priority and she is ensuring progress is being made on the various elements of her reform programme. The ministerial committee overseeing implementation of the programme, chaired by the Tánaiste and including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport, has held a number of meetings and discussed the progress being made.The action plan on the implementation of the MIAB recommendations was published last October. A number of the recommendations have already been implemented. The Motor Insurance Regulations 2002 deal with a minimum period of notice for renewing motor insurance policies and the format of the no-claims bonus certificate. New rules governing advertising by solicitors in relation to personal injuries, for example "no foal, no fee" advertising, have been introduced. The Irish Insurance Federation has implemented or is in the process of implementing through codes of practice a number of other recommendations relating to such matters as giving reasons in writing for refusing a quotation, recognising the driving experience of retired drivers who have a record on their employers' fleets, rating policies based on accident free driving rather than risks based solely on age and desisting from the practise of requiring collateral insurance business to be placed with the company before supplying a motor quotation. The IIF is also in discussions with IBEC about claims settlement guidelines. Progress on the implementation of the other recommendations is continuing.The report of the implementation group on the establishment of the PIAB was also published last October. Appointments to the positions of chairman and ordinary members of the interim PIAB were made in November. The interim board includes representatives of the relevant stakeholders, ICTU, IBEC and the IIF, plus a number of nominees with relevant expertise. I wish Senator O'Toole well in his role as a member of the PIAB. I know that due to his experience he will do an excellent job.The chairman has engaged in an intensive round of bilateral contacts with members of the interim board. These bilateral meetings have covered matters relating to the future work of the board and fundamentals of particular concern to the relevant stakeholders. Discussions have also commenced among members of the board in relation to the future ongoing monitoring of delivery costs of compensation in the PIAB system. At a recent meeting of the board a number of items were discussed and agreement was reached on their advancement. Outline procedures for the PIAB have been agreed and work on the production of a book of quantum has commenced. Agreement on initial drafting of legislation to place the PIAB on a statutory footing was also reached. The work being done by the board is necessary and needs to be done in a thorough manner in order that the PIAB can hit the ground running as soon as it is established on a statutory basis.The PIAB is not designed to reduce levels of compensation but rather to bring about reductions in the cost of delivering that compensation. For 2000 the MIAB report indicated that for motor third party personal injury claims, non-compensation costs as a percentage of compensation costs amounted to 39.5%, while in the case of employer's liability they were 45.9% and for public liability, 56.4%. These levels are clearly not sustainable and the objective of the PIAB is to reduce them. This will reduce insurance costs while hugely benefiting the policyholder.As indicated, action is required in a number of areas and across a number of Departments. For example, the establishment of the PIAB must be accompanied by improvements in court procedures. The Tánaiste is, therefore, working closely with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport to ensure we move forward with a series of co-ordinated actions. The objective is to ensure a fair and efficient compensation system that in no way penalises the victims of accidents.In parallel with the reform programme, my Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study of competition in the insurance marketplace with particular reference to motor, employers' liability and public liability insurance. A public consultation process took place prior to the finalisation of the terms of reference for the study. The scope and terms of reference are: to identify anti-competitive practices or other constraints on competition in the non-life insurance market in Ireland, with particular reference to motor, employers' liability and public liability insurance; to highlight any anti-competitive practices or other constraints particular to the Irish market; to make recommendations to ensure competition works well for consumers; and in the case of problems identified at EU level, to make recommendations for change at that level.Considerable preparatory work in relation to the study has been done. Tender documents in relation to necessary consultancy reports on the insurance industry, the insurance market and statistical and econometrical analysis have been issued as part of this work. It is envisaged that the bulk of it will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004. This study should give us access to accurate information in respect of the insurance market. The reforms being introduced should bring new players into the market, thereby introducing more competition.With the establishment of the IFSRA we are moving into a new era of financial regulation. There will be an effective mechanism to balance the legitimate concerns of consumers with requirements for effective solvency supervision. The legislation charges the IFSRA as a whole – its board, statutory officers, senior management and jobholders – to take consumer issues into consideration. We will also see increased dissemination of information of interest to the consumer in making a choice on purchasing insurance products.The actions I have outlined constitute a comprehensive approach to addressing problems that have developed during the years in the insurance market. The intention is to pursue them with vigour and look for a similar commitment from other actors in the market. While EU law precludes the imposition of price controls on insurance, the Tánaiste has made it clear that she expects a quid pro quo from the insurance industry in the form of reduced premiums. The insurance industry's response will be carefully monitored. The acid test will be in the impact felt in the consumer's pocket.In this regard, it is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of the major motor insurers that further increases in premiums may not be necessary at present and, in one case, that they have already reduced premiums since the beginning of the year. As implementations of the measures contained in the reform programme continue, it is expected that this trend will continue.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. I am sure when he writes his memoirs in years to come, he will acknowledge that 11 and 12 March 2003 were his toughest days in this House. Allied with support of this motion, I call on the Minister to appoint immediately an insurance ombudsman to control the increasingly out of control nature of the motor insurance industry.Young drivers and their parents – who in many cases foot the bill – are at the mercy of companies who deliberately inflate prices for certain categories. Young drivers are unfortunately at the top of these categories. Though all motorists are being held to ransom and caught in the stranglehold of compulsory insurance, the problem is intensified for the young driver. Some insurance companies have a fixed discount per year for accident-free young drivers who drive under their parents' policies. While there is no structured approach to this procedure at present, it could come under the remit of a specially appointed ombudsman. Monitoring by a statutory insurance ombudsman would spread the burden of risk of insuring young drivers across more insurance companies and help reduce the cost of insurance for young people. Currently, companies who quote for young people are so few that the risks they face result in higher insurance rates.Unfortunately, the high level of claims, due to increased accident rates and the numbers of uninsured drivers on our roads, is a contributing factor in insurance price increases. Without an independent regulator, the insurance companies are placing intolerable demands on our motorists, particularly young drivers. While the points system is a welcome addition to help enforce road safety standards, penalties for uninsured drivers – of any age – should entail confiscation of the vehicle, with the proceeds given to the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, the agency that pays the claims against uninsured drivers.I believe that if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is serious about addressing the issue of safety on our roads, he will bring in penalties such as a seven year ban for having no insurance and a life-time ban for persistent offenders. It is an inescapable fact that young drivers have an accident record which is twice the national average. One person is killed every 19 hours on our roads and one person is injured every 40 minutes. Young people make up a high proportion of those killed and injured. In 2000, the number killed in road accidents per 100,000 of the population was higher for 18 to 24 year olds than for any other age cohort, and higher again among males.What is the cause and what is the remedy? The cause, as I see it, is the lack of education and the remedy is education. Driving tests are providing an admirable check but more is needed for young drivers. That extra responsibility should lie with our schools. Take the example of the United States where driving at 16 years is the norm. While there in January, I visited schools where driving instruction is a compulsory credit course for all students. We are ideally set up to follow this example given the structure of our secondary schools with what amounts to a gap year between junior and senior cycles. A compulsory driving module should be built into all transition year courses with driving regarded as an essential life skill. If young people were to finish transition year equipped with theoretical and practical driving skills allied to a certain degree of car maintenance knowledge, the profile of our young drivers would change. Safety standards would rise and, dare I say, our insurance companies might even court their business. Age is not necessarily the problem but mature and responsible attitudes to driving need to be fostered. A systematic approach to the quality and experience of young drivers must be put in place.The present cycle of insurance being weighed to reflect the negative image of the young driver must be broken. The obvious way to break this image is to equip them with the necessary skills and by protecting their rights through recourse to an independent insurance regulator. I believe it is necessary to establish an insurance ombudsman, not just for young drivers but for all.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister on one of his ever more frequent visits to the House. In my short time in the House, I have made an effort to speak on the serious issue of rising costs for businesses and consumers. I welcome the opportunity to discuss another facet of this issue – inflated insurance costs.Without doubt, a major concern for consumers and businesses alike has been the steady rise in insurance costs over the past ten years. Motor insurance is particularly expensive, not only when compared to European prices but worldwide. A recent report by the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment, shows that Irish consumers pay a higher percentage of their earnings on motor insurance than people in any other country in the world. I note that the Government has taken decisive steps in improve this situation.The primary focus should be to develop a pragmatic and workable system to handle insurance claims for the benefit of the claimant and policyholders in general. However, there should be greater transparency in the pricing of this insurance and a guarantee that certain sectors of the population will no longer be discriminated against on the basis of age.Young drivers have long been the victims of crippling insurance premiums. The insurance industry claims that a major reason for the disparity in pricing between young people and older drivers is that the former have a poorer claims record than any other category of driver. These assertions may have some validity. In the NRA report of 2000, it was stated that 25% of all injury accidents reported to the Garda involved at least one young driver. Furthermore, accidents involving young drivers tended to be more severe, thereby producing higher claims from affected parties. Compared to older drivers, young drivers are deemed to be responsible for a higher proportion of the fatal/injury accidents. Young drivers account, on average, for nearly 40% of all car drivers killed and a quarter of all injuries sustained. These are high statistics considering that the category accounts for less than 10% of all road-users.In this light, it is understandable that premiums are weighed against this particular group of drivers. Having said that, however, it is equally understandable that there is such general disgust at a policy that obviously discriminates on the basis of age alone. It is completely unfair to tar all young people with the same costly brush. Not every 28 year old is a menace behind the wheel. Similarly, not everyone over 28 is a naturally gifted, accident-free driver. This is exactly the generalisation that ensures young drivers – it is slightly cheaper for young female drivers – on the whole pay much more than twice the average car insurance premiums.What can be done to right these obvious inequalities? As a possible way of diverting attention from this disparity, the insurance companies have provided a list of specific actions that could be taken to address claims issues particularly relevant to young drivers. The IIF argues that better driving habits and greater safety awareness leading to fewer accidents and therefore fewer claims are essential to reducing the cost of motor insurance for young drivers.It is suggested that as legal costs make up a significant part of insurance costs, any initiative to streamline the legal system, for example by introducing specific personal injury courts and better pre-trial procedures, would also lead to reduced premiums. Furthermore, there has been a general call from insurance companies for tougher road traffic legislation and stronger powers for the Garda in enforcing legislation and in dealing with any offences.However, if such initiatives were carried through, can we truly believe that insurance companies would reduce costs to younger drivers? Such policies are already in place, yet the cost of insurance for young drivers continues to rise. We have recently seen the introduction of the penalty points system, which is having a huge effect in reducing road fatalities, and thus reducing the number of accidents by an even more significant number.It is obvious that all drivers have slowed down and become more cautious since the penalty points system was introduced. Yet we have seen zero action from the insurance companies in reducing the costs to young drivers. The reason is clear. The insurance companies have recognised that rather than being a burden on their profits, younger drivers are their cash cow, earning them over €200 per head on drivers aged between 22 and 24. This is completely unacceptable, and I condemn the greed and irresponsibility of the insurance companies for their chronic failure in this regard.For anyone who had any doubt, the recently-released report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board showed that motor insurance companies, far from losing money, are highly profitable. They may continue to divert attention from themselves, and place the onus on this Government, or on drivers. They may even tell us that 11 September 2001 is to blame, but as any Senator who has been to New York will agree, it is difficult to find Irish-registered young drivers driving on that city's streets.The onus is now on the insurance companies to take action to solve this problem. Young drivers can no longer be discriminated against in such a blatant and unacceptable manner. We have a responsibility as legislators to ensure that all our citizens, and particularly our young citizens, have a fair opportunity to use our roads and have adequate insurance at affordable prices.I call on the Minister to continue his good work in this regard, and to ensure that insurance companies live up to their responsibilities.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I congratulate my colleague, Senator Ross, on putting down this important motion. In terms of young drivers – regrettably I can no longer qualify as one myself – there is a great problem because of the enormous costs involved. They are really quite bizarre. I know that the insurance industry is based on the calculation of actuarial risk, and if certain categories of drivers have a demonstrably greater accident rate, it is perfectly legitimate to penalise them. The insurance companies have signally failed to demonstrate in the case of young drivers that this is the situation.It is important that we have the figures and can properly determine the risk. I do not believe the youth of drivers is the risk factor. These bizarrely high rates act as a disincentive to young people to get insured at all, a much worse situation. A large number of young people are driving around the countryside without insurance, and that exposes the public as well as the individual driver to danger. That is very much to be regretted.I am a little surprised that the Government proposes to amend this motion. To me it is unarguable. The only thing it does not do is praise the Government for all the wonderful things it has done. It would be a pity if we get into this knee-jerk situation where, any time a non-contentious motion is put down by people such as Independent Members, the Government feels the absolute necessity of praising the Minister for matters already dealt with.A couple of weeks ago, the penalty points issue came up in this House and praise was heaped on the Minister by the Government side. Why do it again? It is not necessary. Senator Ross cleverly and appropriately focused on young drivers. Why drag in remarks about penalty points and the decline in fatalities, etc.? No one has any argument with all this, but it is not directly relevant.I would agree with the proposal that we "commend the initiative which the Tánaiste has undertaken with the Competition Authority on a study of competition in the provision of non-life insurance". That is important. The Competition Authority is one of the best bodies established in this country. I am not sure if it was this Government which set it up, but if so, I am sure the Members will pile praise on themselves. Whoever was responsible, it was a good thing. We need a bit more—

I have to say, a Leas-Cathaoirligh, this House is showing an increase in common sense over the past 24 hours that is quite remarkable. I congratulate the Members on what Chairman Mao would have called their Great Leap Forward. I believe insurance companies are involved in a whole series of scams. They are massaging the situation, and using 11 September 2001 as an excuse for everything. Rather than aiding and abetting the insurance companies, we should be hammering them over it.

I would like to tell the House what is happening in my back yard, or in my automobile. My nice tinny Toyota in which I used to skid around Dublin at 85 miles an hour, on the inside of old ladies, blowing the horn, waving my fists and shouting obscenities – exploded. I had to trade it in. I got a wonderful Jaguar motorcar for €5,000 and I have noticed a change in my personality. I have now become the Queen Mother. I am very happy to drive at 30 miles per hour. It does not bother me.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The problem relates to what I said at the outset, that I have no argument with any insurance equation that is the result of an actuarial calculation. There is risk. The insurance company insures you against a particular kind of risk. My motorcar is a very beautiful instrument, but its market value is only about €5,000 or €6,000, thanks to the snobbery of the Irish motorist, who does not want a second-hand car, as well as to the high cost of maintaining and running it. The insurance on it is third party, fire and theft only, so the insurance company cannot claim that the enormous cost of the insurance is because of the replacement value of the parts, because I will have to pay for them regardless. In a larger car I am driving at a slower rate, so I am probably a much safer motorist. For becoming a safer motorist in a cheaper car, I am charged about five times the premium. That is mad.What we should be doing, in terms of the investigation established by the Tánaiste, is looking at how the premium is calculated. It should relate to what the insurance company might have to pay out in certain circumstances. No matter what damage I do, the insurance company has much less exposure. However, its gets away with charging me nearly €2,000 for the privilege of insuring my car.I congratulate Senator Ross on tabling this important motion. I have no doubt it will be popular among the young voters in Trinity College. He is quite right to consider that fact, particularly as we are here to represent different sections of the population. We should use this debate to ensure that the insurance industry is reasonable and fair in its calculations for motor insurance and that young customers, in particular, get value for money without exclusions and loadings that do not bear any relationship to what insurance companies are obliged to pay out. I am pleased to learn that there is an excellent degree of co-operation in the House.

#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	489	At the first Ógra Fianna Fáil conference I attended in 1994, one of the issues on the agenda was how to reduce the cost of insurance for young drivers. It has also been a matter of discussion at every subsequent Ógra conference or meeting of young people.The reduction of deaths and accidents on the roads is particularly noticeable in the four months since the Minister for Transport introduced the penalty points system. Those accidents and the costs involved account for the high cost insurance. The large number of young drivers affected by accidents is a sad reality. Horrific television advertisements illustrate the types of injuries suffered by people who survive motor accidents. Thankfully, their lives have been spared but they may be confined to wheelchairs or live in a vegetative state for the rest of their lives. The lives of young people, their parents, families and friends are ruined as a result of car accidents.While it is important to reduce the cost of car insurance, we should broaden the debate and concentrate on how we can make it safer for young people, pedestrians, older people or the Queen Mother – who might be driving around Dublin in his new Jaguar – to use the roads. We must create an environment where it is safer to use the roads. Education is the principle method of achieving this. We should begin the education process for young people from their first year in secondary school. When I was much younger, the first thing I wanted to do when I was 17 was get my provisional licence. The next was to pass my test, which I did within six months of obtaining my licence. That does not happen anymore.While I recognise the efforts that are being made by the Minister for Transport in the area of provisional licences, it is important that we build the notion of responsibility into our school curriculum. When my father allowed me to drive the car on my own for the first time after I had passed my test, he told me he was giving me a weapon with which I could kill someone if I did not use it responsibly. That is a message we need to get across to people, particularly the young.Many people try to be like Formula One drivers. Even at 17 years of age, I drove around as fast as I could when trying to get from A to B – bettering my friends and racing and chasing around the place. We need to educate young people because they do not have experience. I did not have experience when I was young and it has taken many years to realise I had been a danger to myself, other people in the car and those into whose vehicles I might have crashed. I advocate safer motoring for everybody, not just to reduce the cost of accidents but to protect the lives of young people and those who walk along country roads at night because of the lack of public transport. One must also consider the families of people who suffer brain or spinal injuries in accidents because they must care for the latter at a time when they should be retiring and looking forward to a better life.We need to be more vigilant in relation to the effects of the penalty points system. After the initial furore about the system, traffic speeded up again. It has been noticeably slower in the past few days because of heightened publicity following the Garda report and discussions with the Minister. We need to hammer home the message that speeding kills, time and again. If you speed, you will be caught and penalty points will be applied. That is what is frightening motorists and encouraging them to slow down.Some 64% of the money from claims under €15,000 was paid out to solicitors and experts. That means people who are being paid compensation for accidents are not even getting the full benefit. The money is going to solicitors and the medical people who advise them and attend at the High Court to act as witnesses. That is not right and we need to do something to address it.Senator O'Toole made some good points which are obviously informed by his membership of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. If someone has been injured in an accident, through no fault of their own, and if they are entitled to compensation, we must give it to them in a fair and equitable manner. We cannot have a situation where we have fraudulent and excessive claims where the only people who benefit are lawyers and doctors.On this morning's "Today with Pat Kenny" radio programme, a listener called to say that, for the first time in ten years, the cost of his motor insurance premium had fallen. We may be seeing a general reduction. I agree with the sentiments expressed in this motion. There is an urgent need to do something and to continue to put pressure on the insurance companies. We cannot accept the codswallop that has been floated about 11 September 2001 and global uncertainty. It is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard. I suggest that we give young people something to value, such as a 70% no claims bonus for their first year driving. It will influence their attitude because, if they have something of value, they will not want to lose it. If they know that the difference between their insurance one year and the next will be €3,000 or €4,000, they will be more likely to be responsible in their actions.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The tardiness with which the report of the MIAB was first accepted and then published was disgraceful. I have never figured out the reason the Government took so long to get and then publish it. Nor do I understand the reason it is taking so long to implement. It was particularly damning. The great thing about actuaries and actuarial studies is, depending on the assumptions drawn, one can prove whatever one wishes. Much of it relates to medium and long-term assumptions about rates of depreciation and other matters. It demolished much of this once and for all.It is important to remember that the occasional large award to a tragic individual who has been paralysed does not drive up the cost of motor insurance. The cost is driven up by comparatively small claims doubled by the enormous fees of the legal profession and, in some cases, those of the medical profession. I am married to a doctor and must be careful about what I say.Every item of insurance ought to be based on publishable actuarial evidence. If one has a full no-claims bonus and goes three years without holding insurance, for whatever reason, one loses the no-claims bonus. There can be no actuarial or other evidence to justify this. The companies know they have one caught by the "short and curlies" and increase premia accordingly. What evidence could there be to show that those who have achieved a no-claims bonus and cease to drive for three years pose a greater risk than those who have continued to drive?I am sure the process is full of other matters like this. Insurance has been withdrawn from a skateboarding arena in Cork. While no claims were made against it, after one year in business it could not find a company to give it a quote. This caused 300 or 400 youngsters to lose a venue where they could enjoy themselves and do something in their spare time. This cannot have been based on any actuarial evidence; the companies in question decided it was an unknown quantity and did not want to insure it. This is happening all over the country.I look forward to the report on the professions of the Competition Authority which I hope is as outspoken in this case as it has been in dealing with travel agents, farmers and other groups. While I am a professional, the mystique of the professions is one of this country's problems. The pretence that it is to our benefit that the Law Society or Bar Council regulates a profession and fixes fees in the process is nonsense. We would be better off if we had a limitless number of law and other professionals based on academic qualifications. The idea that quality can be delivered to society by giving professions control over themselves and their fees is a load of nonsense. As most of those professionals form part of my University constituency, it is evident that I am not playing to a gallery. I was going to talk about numerically challenged actuaries but have decided to leave it out. I did not invent the term "numerically challenged".There is a fundamental problem about honesty in our society. Each of us can cite prominent figures in society who were generously compensated through insurance claims because their careers had been ended, to which they miraculously returned after the court case had ended. I know this happened in the case of a certain individual. If this is the quality of honesty in our society, is it any surprise that the first thought of many on having an accident is to wonder how they will maximise their compensation? There needs to be a cultural shift by both claimants and professions.

I am glad Government Senators amended the Government amendment and dropped the reference to 11 September 2001. As a younger driver, it is important that I speak on this issue. While I agreed with much of what Senator Leyden said, I disagree with what he said about the speed with which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was acting on the issue. Many speakers, particularly those from the Government parties, have said it has dragged on for years. If it has, why is it only now that the Tánaiste is taking steps to resolve it? This could not be described as swift.I drove the ten miles to college every morning before I was elected to this House.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	497	That was in the dim and distant past, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and I have no recollection of it. I had to pay a premium that was a multiple of the value of my car. Other young people also experience this. The premium I paid for my 1.4 litre car that was worth no more than €200 was €2,500. I was not alone in this. There are people with bigger premia for less valuable cars.I agree with what other speakers have said about the inclusion of education in driving in the school curriculum. This should be done in a more permanent way in second-level schools, perhaps by using transition year. Senator O'Toole has referred to the driving test in this House. It is ridiculous that the test does not encompass overtaking, probably the most dangerous part of driving. It should be reformed to include an overtaking manoeuvre, the source of many accidents.Those living in rural areas can use a field to practise driving. However, there are no facilities for young people to do this in urban areas. It is daunting to go behind the wheel for the first time. People can often find themselves on the road without being fully prepared for it.The standard of roads, a topic which has not been mentioned in this debate, is the cause of many accidents. While we often compare ourselves to other European countries, we do not have comparable roads. In many cases, our national primary routes could be better described as dirt tracks. Nobody ever seems to take that into consideration when discussing this issue.Competition is another issue. If we are to reduce the cost of premia, we must introduce a reasonable amount of competition in the car insurance industry. I worked for a number of months in an insurance brokerage. I was unable to quote people of my own age or a little older or younger when they rang seeking quotes. When I put their details into the system, I was unable to obtain a quote from the car insurance companies. In 1993, there were 17 insurance companies selling car insurance. By 1999, there were only five. There are probably only three or four now. That situation must be examined. If we are to resolve this problem, we must introduce competition into the market.I support the motion as amended by the House. This is an important issue that affects everybody. Some Members mentioned that young people are often better drivers that older people. I prefer to drive myself places rather than allowing my father to drive me and I am sure that is the case for many young people.

I have been informed that it will decrease when I am 25, which is not too far away. I hope it will decrease, but it is a crazy amount. It is not fair or equitable that older people, by virtue of the fact that they are older, pay less. I have never had a claim and I have had a full licence for six years. The system is not justifiable. I support the Independent Senators who brought this matter before the House. It is an important issue.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	500	It was a great experience to hear this serious topic debated and I compliment the Senators on bringing the motion before the House. There are three points on which we are in agreement and on which the Minister of State and the Department should take action.There is serious discrimination against young people by virtue of high insurance premia. As Senator Ross stated, we also agree on the necessity to improve driving standards. Senator Bannon suggested that transition year in school be used to teach young people how to drive and that they should get points for it. That is a creative and innovative idea. I commend it, from a practical point of view, to the Department of Education and Science.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The other important point, in addition to learning to drive properly, is courtesy on the road. There is little courtesy on the roads. People are generally not mannerly and courteous to others when they are driving. If one gives way to a motorist, they generally will not thank one for it. That is frustrating. If they offered acknowledgement, one would do it more frequently. Courtesy is part of learning to drive. Senator Ross made another important point, namely, that young people should not be allowed to have any drink taken when they drive.These are key practical points in seeking a solution to this serious discrimination. There is consensus on both sides of the House that there is discrimination. It would be interesting to see these practical suggestions implemented. I drove back from the transport conference in Clonmel on Friday.

The markings on the inner margins of the roads were extremely poor. It was about 1 a.m. and when large trucks were coming towards me, I could not see the edge of the road because of the strength of their headlights. The local authorities have a responsibility for this. I do not know how county managers allow anything less than definite road markings in their counties.

I particularly thank Senator Leyden for coming forward with a constructive suggestion. There was no ambition on the part of Independent Senators to have a row about this. We simply wished to raise the issue, debate it and get some agreement from the Government.I am not sure that I would have been so agreeable if I had read the Minister of State's speech beforehand. It was, as ministerial speeches to the Seanad always are, a holding statement. In effect, it stated that this happened last April and the Government is going to start examining it now. It then referred to that bête noire of many Members of the House, a high level implementation group.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I hate those.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Leader is correct. It was mentioned in the first paragraph. A high level implementation group usually means it is full of rather pompous people who will not reach any conclusions. The Minister of State then went on to refer to two of my pet hates, the two words in any speech that drive me mad, namely, IBEC and the ICTU. They were used as a sort of defence for delay and committees. I became somewhat suspicious of the defensive nature of the Minister of State's response.Nevertheless, there is a genuine desire to tackle this problem, although I doubt that the Government or anybody else knows how to do what they want to do, which is reduce the price of premia. Although there have been many suggestions, eloquent speeches, reports, committees and comments on insurance companies, there is no indication that premia will be reduced. That is the nub of the problem. I suspect that Senator Ryan and others were right. The problem is the insurance companies. It was indicative of somebody's thinking that there was an offensive paragraph in the Government amendment which was, effectively, an apologia for the insurance companies. I am glad that emerged.We should confront the insurance companies and ask them what they are doing and who is running them. The insurance companies are the biggest cartel. They are a bigger and more menacing cartel in some ways than the banks. They have captive victims. One cannot avoid going to an insurance company and that is the problem. Members are unanimous about wanting to tackle this problem and reduce premia, but the vested interests appear to be delaying the implementation of the necessary measures. Those vested interests appear to be more powerful than the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.There were some good suggestions in the debate. Senator McCarthy's suggestion, that people should get some type of points rebate if they have a clean driving record, whether they are young or old, was excellent. We should look at the insurance companies in a more combative way. As Senator Ryan correctly said, like all professionals they confuse us with jargon. They seem to think that because they talk a language we do not understand, with its embedded values and God knows what else, they are practising some sort of superior science and are, therefore, justified in what they are doing. They are blinding us with that science and we are allowing them to do so when they could easily charge lower premia if they got their houses in order.Let us consider insurance companies. What is happening with them? They are losing money hand over fist and the message is getting across to people that this is dangerous for the financial system and, therefore, there must be some way that we should subsidise it. The idea is being implanted in consumers' minds that there is a justification for some of the loss-making sections of insurance companies to be subsidised by young drivers. This was reflected in some of the thinking on the Government's amendment, but it is not something we can justify.We should question these companies who have been dragged kicking into the era of transparency. We should examine the actuarial valuations because actuaries are more fallible than any of us. Anybody who looks at what has happened to actuaries' predictions and assumptions will know that a babe in arms would do better. These people, however, have a sort of pseudo-sophistication which dazzles and confuses us, so we accept what they say. The insurance industry is based on an emperor without too many clothes, and young drivers are suffering as a result.

#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be representing our country abroad on this significant weekend for Irish people everywhere.It is appropriate that I should raise this issue on the Adjournment as it concerns the Irish community in Britain. In recent weeks, the British Government introduced a Licensing Bill in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation has resulted in expressions of concern from the Irish community in Britain as to the possible adverse effects it could have, particularly on Irish cultural activities as practised in various centres across the United Kingdom. This is of particular concern to the Federation of Irish Societies, the umbrella body representing our citizens in Britain. The federation has mounted a strong campaign through local Members of Parliament to raise awareness of the possible consequences of certain sections of the Licensing Bill.I hasten to add that the Bill is a matter for the British Government, whose business it is to regulate licensing matters. I am, however, reflecting the views of the Irish community in Britain, members of which are concerned that the legislation might have adverse effects on cultural activities. The main reason for this concern is that the Bill seeks to change the licensing system for entertainment in clubs and similar venues from the traditional magistrates system. Under that system, local magistrates could license such institutions, but under the proposed new system licensing powers will be transferred to local authorities and will be exercised by elected representatives.The transfer of such powers to local authorities is something that, on the face of it, Members of this House would welcome. There is a concern, however, that pressures which would traditionally have been borne by magistrates – who would have been able to take a more dispassionate view because they operate in a non-political environment – will now be transferred to local councillors. A famous member of the Irish diaspora, the late Tipp O'Neill, said that all politics are local. Therefore, there is a real possibility that vexatious, malicious or mischievous complaints could be lodged against applications for the renewal of licences by or on behalf of the Irish community.I want to bring to the Minister of State's attention an amendment that the Federation of Irish Societies believes should be included in the Bill. Because of the close relationship between the Irish and British Governments, I am asking the Department of Foreign Affairs to bring these concerns to the attention of Her Majesty's Government at the highest level. The amendment, which the Federation of Irish Societies believes should be included, would specifically protect community-owned venues for ethnic minorities in Britain, including the Irish, from vexatious, malicious or racist complaints. The federation is seeking to have the amendment incorporated in Britain's race relations legislation.The 1997 report of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality – Discrimination in the Irish Community – pulled no punches in this regard. It stated that at the extreme end of discrimination there are pure racists such as members of the British National Party, the National Front and Combat 18. It is sad to note that some elected politicians in Britain have displayed racist, anti-Irish undertones in what they say and do.We had the recent example of a leading businessman who did not like what he read in The Guardian newspaper. When he rang up to berate the journalist involved, the conversation was taped and what flowed from him was a torrent of invective, most of it of an anti-Irish nature. He profusely apologised afterwards because he owns a number of retail outlets, some of which operate in this country, and he was concerned about the adverse impact of his remarks. I suggest, however, that he would not have made this apology but for the fact that the conversation was made public.This is a very real issue, although I do not want to over-elaborate on the other elements of the Licensing Bill. On the positive side, I have been informed that an amendment to the Bill, which was sponsored by the Musicians' Union in Britain and supported by the Federation of Irish Societies, was passed in the House of Lords yesterday. This will, in effect, exempt all premises, including Irish clubs and centres, from what were termed to be draconian provisions on regulated entertainment. The legislation will now provide exemption for events at which attendance is below 250 persons if the entertainment finishes at 11.30 p.m. The result of the amendment is that a significant number of Irish centres and community halls, which have been used for Irish dancing and music classes, will now be exempt as the measure has been accepted by the House of Lords.I would add a note of caution, however, because once the Bill is passed by the House of Lords it will return to the House of Commons. It is normal British Government practice to try to overturn amendments that may not be acceptable. Since this was an Opposition amendment that was accepted in the House of Lords, there is some fear that it might be overturned by the Labour Government which may not be in sympathy with it.The Minister of State should take note of the amendment which, as it stands, has been accepted as part of the Bill. It would exempt all premises provided the maximum attendance is 250 and the entertainment finishes at 11.30 p.m. This is very much in line with the views of and welcomed by the Federation of Irish Societies and the Irish community generally.While keeping in mind the protocols involved, this is not an attempt to interfere with the legislative process in another country's parliament, rather it is about having pro-active responsibility for our citizens living in Britain, welcomed by the British population, settled and earning a living there, who wish to retain their separate ethnic origins and pursue their Irish cultural activities without fear of having to shut them down because of elements in society who would be racist and anti-Irish. It would be most unfortunate if a law which, on balance, seems to be welcomed generally across the United Kingdom was to be used as a battering ram against the Irish community in Britain. It is in that context that I ask the Minister of State to convey the concerns of the Irish community to the relevant British authorities along the lines outlined.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-12 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, regrets he cannot reply as he is abroad on important business.In April 2000 the British Government published a White Paper on reforming alcohol and entertainment licensing. The White Paper set out proposals for modernising and integrating the alcohol, public entertainment, theatre, cinema, night cafes and late night house licensing schemes in England and Wales.On the basis of the White Paper, the British Government drafted a Bill which was introduced in November 2002 by Culture Minister, Tessa Jowell. It received its Third Reading in the House of Lords last night and will be debated in the House of Commons shortly. Its aim is to regulate public entertainment through licensing with a view to addressing concerns about public safety and noise pollution.Entertainment is described in Schedule 1 of the Bill as including any of the following: a performance of a play, an exhibition of a film, an indoor sports event, boxing or wrestling entertainment, a performance of live music, any playing of recorded music, a performance of dance or entertainment of a similar description where the entertainment takes place in the presence of an audience and is provided for the purpose, or for purposes which include the purpose, of entertaining that audience.The original Bill required all public entertainments to be licensed. A lobbying campaign to have the Bill amended is being led by the Musicians Union and the Arts Council for England. Exemptions for entertainment in churches and educational establishments have been secured during debate on the Bill. Deregulation of music incidental to other activities was also addressed in an amendment.The Minister for Foreign Affairs is aware that some provisions of the Bill have given rise to concerns on the part of Irish cultural organisations, including Comhaltas Ceoltoirí Éireann. In particular, there are concerns that a requirement to license any performance, live music or dancing will introduce costs which small clubs cannot hope to meet, including the cost of the licence and the cost of compliance with new requirements such as hire of security personnel, different health and safety standards and so on. There are also concerns that impromptu music and singing sessions, central to the Irish and English folk tradition, will be illegal if held on unlicensed premises. The previous licensing regime allowed publicans to hire one or two musicians to provide entertainment without having to seek a licence.The Federation of Irish Societies is the main umbrella group for Irish groups in Britain. Affiliates include community care, social and cultural groups. The federation lobbies both the British and Irish Governments on issues of concern to the Irish community in Britain. This issue was raised at the federation's national meeting on 1 February 2003 in Liverpool. Representatives of Irish clubs and cultural organisations noted their concern that the draft criteria for licensing of premises as music venues and associated costs could lead to the closure of clubs and cause great difficulties for Comhaltas and cultural groups organising musical gatherings. It was decided that the federation and organisations would lobby locally and nationally on this matter, liaising with the campaign of other interested parties, led by the Musicians Union.The Minister for Foreign Affairs understands this issue very well and, at his request, the Embassy of Ireland in London has availed of its frequent contacts with Members of the House of Commons and House of Lords to appropriately convey the concerns of the Federation of Irish Societies. He recognises and appreciates the enormous contribution that Irish cultural groups have made, not only to strengthening the cultural identity of the Irish community in Britain but also to enriching the cultural life of the country in general. He very much hopes any adverse effects which the provisions of the Bill might have on their activities can be avoided.The matter is being debated in the House of Lords where a number of amendments have been proposed. The House of Lords voted last month during the Bill's Report Stage to exclude unamplified incidental live music from the licensing regime. As the Senator said, an amendment was introduced last night to exempt small premises from the licensing regime. It was designed to safeguard live music performances in small venues – those with fewer than 250 customers. This will only apply where the entertainment ends at 11.30 p.m. The amendment was passed.The Bill has yet to be debated in the House of Commons. However, the concerns of the Federation of Irish Societies in regard to aspects of the Bill will continue to be raised, where appropriate. I will convey the Senator's views, including his concern that some of the amendments could be overturned, to the Minister. Like the Senator, I have concerns about some aspects of the Bill. As one who visits the Wexford-London Association and other associations in London on a regular basis, I understand from where the Senator is coming. I will pass on his comments to the Minister.

I am particularly reassured as I am fully aware of his ongoing engagement with the Irish community generally in Britain and particularly with those members who come from County Wexford. We may have met on one occasion in that context some years back. I am also reassured by the fact that he is aware of the real possibility that an important amendment introduced last night might be overturned. I am sure the Irish community in Britain and the Federation of Irish Societies which represents it can be equally reassured by the reply given by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am grateful that the Department acted so quickly in response to my request of recent days to address this important matter for Irish families living in Britain.The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 March 2003.
