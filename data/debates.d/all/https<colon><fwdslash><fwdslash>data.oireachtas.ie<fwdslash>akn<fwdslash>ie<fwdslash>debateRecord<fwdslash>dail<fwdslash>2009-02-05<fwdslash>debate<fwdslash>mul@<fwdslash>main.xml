          <p eId="para_35">Two days ago the Taoiseach announced a pension levy on incomes, which will affect approximately 400,000 employees in the public service, and told us there would be legislation to give effect to this measure.  I asked him yesterday when that legislation would be published.  He did not give me a specific time but indicated it would be soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I am sure the Tánaiste is aware that there is very considerable anger and confusion among the employees who will be affected by this levy.  In the absence of legislation there does not seem to be a great deal of clarity about how it will apply to them.  We are told, for example, that it will apply on gross income.  Does that mean it will apply to payments other than basic pay, such as overtime for a nurse who fills in over a busy weekend in accident and emergency?  Does it apply to a soldier in Chad?  Yesterday, the Minister for Defence could not tell the House whether this levy will apply to the special allowances that are paid to our soldiers serving abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I am entitled to set out briefly why I believe that legislation needs to be published soon.  People do not know how this situation is going to affect them.  It now appears that the levy will apply to earnings which are not pensionable.  I do not know whether that is legal.  Has the Attorney General given an opinion on that?  How will it apply, for example, to employees in the public service who were employed after 1995 and who pay the full rate of PRSI?</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I listened with interest to the statement by the Minister for Finance yesterday and there was much of reality in his comments.  He said that the savings on the €8.1 billion capital programme, because of lower tenders, amount to €300 million.  He also said, and I agree, that the protection and creation of jobs is of paramount importance.  In that context, he said school buildings would be an important element of the Government's programme——</p>

I suggest to him and to the Tánaiste, that they should take €10 million out of the saving of €300 million and allocate it to the cervical cancer screening programme which the Government withdrew last year in an insidious, insensitive and scandalous manner.</p>

They employ more than 300,000 people and one legislative measure would be of assistance to them if the Government acted on it.

A landlord and tenant Bill has been promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but it is in the third division of the list of Bills under preparation.

          <p eId="para_202">Week after week over recent months we have had announcements of job losses throughout the country.  In all cases, the agencies charged with responsibility for job creation and the support of industries have come to the help and assistance as far as possible to support those companies which indicated they were about to leave in part or were closing altogether.  It is necessary for all of these agencies to indicate their responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">On the Order of Business I asked the Tánaiste to indicate whether the remit of Enterprise Ireland had changed dramatically in the recent past.  I have always believed that its responsibility was to support and help Irish indigenous industries.  However, I must state my disbelief at what happened recently under the auspices of Enterprise Ireland.  A letter I received from the CEO of Enterprise Ireland states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_204">Thank you for your letter of 28 January.  In response to the downturn in the construction sector, Enterprise Ireland put in place a number of initiatives, including a Leadership 4 Growth programme for CEOs of the construction companies and a number of trade-related activities in support of new businesses development in that sector.  A number of companies in that sector are also actively seeking access to the new areas of technology, new products and processes.  As part of that response, Enterprise Ireland organised a visit to the International Builders Show in Las Vegas.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I want the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has direct responsibility for this matter, to indicate clearly why there was a junket to Las Vegas parallel to that which occurred under the auspices of FÁS.  How could Enterprise Ireland, which only has responsibility for indigenous industries, take the CEOs, as they are termed, of the building and construction industry to Las Vegas?  How in God's earthly world could this be a response to Irish needs in these times?  Bearing in mind that we talk about development, the Taoiseach announced at Christmas how Ireland could develop a smart economy.  What I have described is, in anybody's book, too smart a development.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">When I contacted Enterprise Ireland following the closure of Cigna in Loughrea, County Galway, I was told it had no money whatsoever except €5,000 that was to be granted to a company for consultancy work.  While Enterprise Ireland was telling me it could not support an industry in Loughrea, it was in Las Vegas on a junket.  Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicate clearly the responsibility of Enterprise Ireland for the development of Irish industry?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_207">I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The backdrop to the country's financial difficulties was outlined graphically by the Taoiseach in the Dáil yesterday.  He indicated approximately 36,000 private sector employees lost their jobs in January.  That is an indicator of the human misery associated with the downturn in the economy. <i>Ipso facto</i>, the undeniable truth that almost dare not speak its name is that not a single public sector employee has lost his job in the same period.  I am not comfortable with framing the debate on this issue as a conflict between the public and private sectors but that is an undeniable fact.  Many of the 36,000 who lost their jobs would willingly have taken wage reductions or opted for four-day weeks, as many of their colleagues have done.  They would have done everything possible to cling on to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Collectively, we all need to forge national consensus on how to proceed.  I very much regret that the Taoiseach, in outlining the proposals, missed the opportunity to show that this House is prepared to lead by example.  I have difficulty with how his proposals are skewed to the disadvantage of lower-paid public servants.  Over the years, particularly in recent years because of economic affluence, there has been an explosion in the number of Oireachtas committees, Chairmen, convenors and Ministers of State.  We should only have one Minister of State for every Department, totalling 15, and only one committee pertaining to each Department, also totalling 15.  Bearing in mind the issue of sitting Members drawing ministerial pensions, we should show we are prepared to take the pain ourselves.  By doing so, we would go some way towards forging the required national consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">These are unprecedented economic times.  It is simply not sustainable that the country would continue to borrow €55 million per day.  This is merely the start of it, and it is a poor start given that we have not managed to forge the required national consensus, as is evident in the newspapers.  While nobody accepts pain willingly, a greater effort could have been made by the Taoiseach over recent months, during which his Government prevaricated, to forge the consensus necessary to see us through the crisis.  The cuts of €2 billion, which will have an adverse impact on many, are only the beginning in that we face cuts of €4 billion next year and the year thereafter.  The Taoiseach missed an opportunity in that regard.  We in the House should be prepared to lead in respect of the cuts in the areas I have outlined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_211">There is an old adage that cash is king, and this is never more true than when there is no cash.  The message is so critical that it is worth repeating.  Just in case there are any slow learners, I reiterate that cash is king.  Our Government does not have any cash to pay its way and we are borrowing approximately €55 million per day to pay our daily bills.  Quite simply, we are living beyond our means and this must stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The country faces two major problems — the massive hole in the Exchequer finances and the growing national economic crisis, which is such that thousands of people are losing their jobs every month.  The banking crisis is really a sideshow to the decline in the well-being of the national economy.  How we solve these crises will depend on the problems we define.  The Exchequer deficit is so vast and deteriorating so rapidly that there is a need for immediate action.  The timescale in which to identify and address all the economic issues is too long to permit any delay in tackling the immediate financial crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Two days ago, the Government introduced a series of measures to tackle the financial crisis.  There has been much negative commentary on the absence of decisive leadership over recent months.  With regard to what one should do in a crisis, an old Australian saying suggests that if one is up to one's ass in a swamp with crocodiles, it is time to take big steps.  Instead of taking big steps, the Government went for long, leisurely walks with the social partners.  The measures announced yesterday could have been announced at any time in the past two months.  I broadly support these measures in so far as they will work.  Good disaster management requires that the current crisis should not be allowed to overwhelm in-depth analysis of any key factors that led to it.  A fundamental review and public acknowledgement of the origin of the crisis are critical to development of the right solution, and particularly to the development of public confidence and trust in the solution given that harsh changes are essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The Government has failed to carry out any fundamental review of the origins of the crisis and the reasons are obvious.  The Government is responsible for approximately 80% of the current difficulties and international factors account for the rest.  It must accept responsibility publicly; otherwise, public trust and confidence will continue to drain away.  Having failed to carry out any fundamental review of the origins of the current crisis, it has failed to identify any new or creative ideas on how to proceed as a country.  The recent Framework for a Pact for Stabilisation, Social Solidarity and Economic Renewal is nothing more than a winning entry at a feis for economic clichés.  The Government is bringing forward a series of short-term tactical micro-steps to address individual elements of the immediate crisis.  These steps are founded on the idea that, if taken, we will return to where we were on the wealth and economic growth path.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Some fundamental questions need to be asked.  Do we really want to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world?  Do we really want to return to a level of economic growth that pushes our infrastructure and social fabric to their limits?  Do we really want to be absentee landlords to the world in our race for wealth?  Did a degree of crassness creep into our society?  We should aim to be one of the best countries in the world.  The most fundamental requirement at present is to protect existing manufacturing jobs.  We have an open, exporting economy and only the manufacturing sector can provide enough quality jobs to result in full employment in the medium term.  To maintain a strong, viable manufacturing sector, we must declare manufacturing to be the foundation of the national economy and benchmark manufacturing costs, including labour costs, against those of the main European manufacturing countries.  We cannot rely on tax breaks that can be wiped out in the stroke of a pen.  All sectors in our economy must be benchmarked against the manufacturing sector.  If we take these steps we can really hope to weather the storm and come out stronger when it passes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important topic.  Last week, when I had a few brief moments to talk about it, I mentioned two issues, the first of which was the negativity that emanates from this Chamber.  As a nation we do not benefit when the Opposition, day in, day out, talks down the country and talks about the negative aspects.  We are in a most serious worldwide crisis.  No country is free of problems.  We see what is happening in America, Britain and across Europe.  As a Parliament, we should recognise publicly that we have major problems.  Borrowing €55 million a day is not sustainable.  In our private lives none of us would expect that we could spend more money than we earn.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It is time the Labour Party stated publicly that we have major problems and that we must do something about it.  The media today have put it bluntly to the Labour Party that it must offer solutions.  It is easy to criticise.  I accept it is the Opposition's role to offer criticism but it must offer solutions also.  I was brought up in a business environment where from a young age I was told bluntly that if I disagreed with a business proposal I had to put forward a credible alternative.  I accept we have problems but the Opposition must offer solutions.  At a time of national crisis the Members of Parliament should endeavour to work together to come up with solutions rather than the crossfire we hear day in, day out.  All Members have been contacted by people who have lost their job, are about to lose their job or have a family member who has lost a job.  The public expect us to show solidarity with their plight.  They do not like to see media stories about Opposition party leaders criticising the Taoiseach.  People expect us to come up with solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Yesterday, Moody's put Ireland in a negative category.  Fortunately, we still retain our AAA status.  If people abroad detect negativity from parliamentarians they will ask questions about Ireland Inc.  If we borrow €55 million a day it behoves us as a Parliament to ensure that the people from whom we seek the money will give us the best possible interest rate.  It is critical that we do not get further into debt and that we can borrow at the best available terms.  Bickering in this Chamber does not help the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Deputy Rabbitte is a man for whom I have great respect.  I suggest the Labour Party changes tack in the national interest.  Let us fight each other on minor issues but let us collectively put our shoulder to the wheel on the economy so that we can get from where we are today to where we need to go tomorrow and in the future.  The public and the 330,000 people who are on the dole might appreciate that more.  Let us get over apportioning blame to various parties and groups.  The public do not want to hear about blame, they want us to take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">We must get our public finances in order.  Everybody in the Chamber privately accepts that we must reduce public spending by €2 billion this year, €4 billion in the following two years, €3 billion in the fourth year and €3.5 billion in the fifth year.  People in this Chamber should be big enough to say that is what we must do and come up with ways of doing it.  The Government made its decision yesterday.  The Opposition should recognise that was a courageous and correct move or it should put forward an alternative.  It is not good enough to say the cuts are being made in the wrong sector.  Neither is it good enough to say people in certain salary categories should be excluded unless an alternative is put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">No Member will hear a person say he or she is affected more than another person.  The people who work in this House are affected, the same as we, the politicians, are — some more so than others.  Perhaps the measures require a little tweaking here and there.  I am sure that can be achieved when the Bill comes before the Dáil in the coming weeks.  The broad principle of everybody putting their shoulder to the wheel and taking some of the pain is reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The stabilisation of our banking system is the second issue on which the Government has been concentrating.  Each one of us in the Chamber is critical of what happened in Anglo Irish Bank and the actions of certain directors.  However, as politicians, we should accept we need a banking system, as our economy cannot function without it.  We cannot let any bank fail.  I do not wish to harp on about the past, I look forward to the future.  I hope that when the Government introduces the recapitalisation plan for AIB and Bank of Ireland, the Labour Party will accept the reality that we must do that in the national interest, whether we like it or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I agree with what the Taoiseach said yesterday, that the salaries of banking executives need to be reduced substantially.  It is gratifying that President Obama followed the Taoiseach's lead yesterday.  The American Government is putting $800 billion into the system.  It is good that the American Government can print money to put into business or bail out banks.  We do not have that luxury in Ireland as we cannot print our own money.  The British Government has taken the position also that it can print off hundreds of millions of sterling and that will resolve the issue but I am not convinced.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">We must get our finances in order and stabilise the banking system.  We must get back to being cost-effective and competitive in business.  We became a high wage economy in the Celtic tiger years.  I regret to say that we ensured certain businesses would go to the Far East and eastern Europe where the wages are one third of ours.  It does not come easy to say it but that is the reality.  In the current recession we can introduce cost-effectiveness to business and then when the good times come we will be in a position to move forward again.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">I welcome the €150 million investment by the Government in home insulation schemes and the school building programme.  We need to get small businesses working so they can retain jobs.  If every small business in the country created only one extra job we would have more than 100,000 extra jobs.  We must ensure small businesses survive.  The Government is committed to ensure that small businesses will be facilitated through the measures it will introduce in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">Like everyone else in this House, I am shocked by the latest unemployment figures.  All of us know from our own constituencies that the position had significantly worsened over the past month or so.  That was indicated by the 70% increase in unemployment in Kerry between December 2007 and December 2008, and the statistics, when broken down locally, will show yet another steep increase.  As I have said previously, this will further worsen all the problems associated with large scale unemployment.  We have witnessed the return of emigration, which will have an extremely negative impact on the fabric of local communities and exacerbate the problems associated with rural decline and isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">For those who remain there are the daily struggles of attempting to cope with making ends meet on social welfare payments.  That will contribute to a marked increase in poverty with all the consequences that will have on the State in terms of increased demands on the health service and other public provisions.  As others have said, the impact of unemployment levels on State expenditure will mean a significant additional demand on public provisions to the extent that they will probably negate any of the savings claimed to have been made by the measures announced in the House on Tuesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It should also be borne in mind that while there is a temptation on the part of the Government to make even further short-term savings by, for example, shedding jobs in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, the cost of supporting the workers made redundant will vastly outweigh any savings made through cutting down on the relatively minor losses made by the public transport providers who are obliged to provide services, for example, to the more remote rural parts of the country, which are unlikely to make a profit.  However,  that is why services such as transport and others were taken into public ownership in the first place.  Private enterprise was either unwilling or unable to run them efficiently to provide an adequate service or to make a profit from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">That is worth bearing in mind at a time many people are seeking to blame the public sector for all the ills in this country.  Many of those leading that call did very well out of the Celtic tiger.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, little of the driving force within the economy was led by indigenous enterprise, other than the construction sector.  We remained, and continue to remain, overwhelmingly dependent on inward foreign investment in what there is of a manufacturing base and in key areas such as information technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Many people were happy to invest in the services sector in which wages have remained low, even with the introduction of the minimum wage, and working conditions and workers' rights have been undermined, yet those who made large profits in this sector, who were happy to charge consumers more than they would have had to pay in other countries, are the first to demand that those who gained least over the period of economic prosperity should pay for it.  The same applies to those who were happy to push the price of housing and rents well above any other increases in the cost of living and certainly above any increases in wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">That is why there is understandable resentment and anger among people who have lost their jobs and people within the public service who are being asked to take a substantial pay cut, not to mention the perception that this Government has bailed out the banks and left those responsible walk away from the mess they created.  Some of those involved were shown to have engaged in practices, which, at the very least, were underhand and unethical, and which, it would appear, were designed to allow them and their friends to continue to gamble on the property and other markets.  Not many gamblers have their tab picked up by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The Taoiseach yesterday, in defending the pay cuts imposed on public servants, said he would like bank executives take a 25% pay cut.  Surely, where the State has, in effect, guaranteed the banks' losses and nationalised the debt they built up through their irresponsibility, the Taoiseach can do more than suggest what those banks, which are effectively owned by the State, should do.  He is not suggesting that nurses and teachers and postal workers should take a pay cut or there should be no increases in pay for any workers or that there will be job losses in places like Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  He is imposing these measures and, in the process, ignoring the structures of social partnership, which he and IBEC were happy to use when it suited them to effectively dampen the wage increases in both the public and private sectors during the boom.  Now that the same people have contributed to the current mess, the unions and those they represent are simply ignored and told what to do.  The contrast between that and the manner in which the property speculators and the gambling bankers were saved could not be any starker.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">There is a great deal of discussion currently about responsibility and everyone taking their share of the burden.  That is all very well but if that is to be seen to be more than empty rhetoric, then it must be seen to be put into effect.  However, where people can contrast the treatment of the bankers with that of public sector workers, they will fail to be convinced.  Many people this week are asking themselves why they should take the hit when others are being allowed to walk away.  The bankers and developers and cowardly political practices are responsible for the mess we are in.  The bankers, through irresponsible lending to facilitate developers to increase the cost of land way beyond its value, have contributed to many young people who bought homes facing negative equity.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">Deputy Kennedy asked the Labour Party to acknowledge that we have a major problem.  I have no difficulty at all acknowledging as much and the Labour Party has drawn attention to the fact that we have a major problem going back many months while the Government was in denial.  Apart from drawing attention to the fact the Government has taken on board ideas advanced by Deputy Gilmore, for example, in his speech to our party conference last November such as the insulation of homes and the refurbishment and rebuilding of schools, the Labour Party over a number of years — it is on the record of the House — pleaded with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to intervene in the cost of building land and advocated many of the proposals in the Kenny report.  At the same time I argued that case with him, my colleague, Deputy Burton, highlighted the extension and continuation of tax incentives to maintain the property bubble while the economy was in boom, but we were ignored.  It is that ignoring of the obvious in terms of economics that has worsened the crisis we face.  The property bubble, facilitated and encouraged by Fianna Fáil, in particular, has led to the worsening and deepening of the crisis we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">When I am challenged by Deputy Kennedy to say the Labour Party acknowledges we have a problem, I most emphatically do, and if the views of the party had been followed, we would not be in quite the degree of mess we are in.  I accept the Deputy's bona fides, although I have some difficulty with anybody who sees politics through a prism or believes that President Obama last night followed the lead of the Taoiseach in the matter of bankers' pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">We all occasionally surrender to self-delusion.  When Deputy Kennedy criticises the Opposition for drawing attention to the mistakes that were made, especially by Deputy Bertie Ahern's second Government, in the management of the economy, I must point out to him that he was never in the House to watch Fianna Fáil in opposition.  I have witnessed this and, by God, if the Deputy thinks the Opposition is irresponsible now, he ought to have been here to watch Fianna Fáil in full flight in opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I accept that getting control of the direction of the public finances must be part of the solution to the crisis into which we have been plunged.  It must be seen as a part of the solution because the package before us is neither fair or balanced.  It is punitive on people on low pay.  A conflict has been set up between private sector and public sector workers but many people forget, for example, that a clerical officer in the Houses of the Oireachtas or elsewhere starts on a salary of €23,221, a staff nurse at €30,339, and a special needs assistant at €23,232.  These people are now liable to the full belt of this levy.  When the Taoiseach says he wants to go the route of social partnership, I draw his attention to what the agreed framework document spells out several times.  I will quote one paragraph.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_241">The Government and social partners are fully committed to an approach in which all sectors of society contribute in accordance with their ability to do so, and conversely the most vulnerable, low paid, unemployed and social welfare recipients are insulated against the worst effects of recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">That is not what we have.  We have a package that punishes the low paid and rather than a Government boasting about the number of people who do not pay tax, it ought to be highlighting the number of people who are on very low pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The package before us is riddled with internal inconsistencies.  When tax is applied to the proposed pension levy — it is an income levy and not a pension levy — people on lower pay end up paying more in the pension levy than people on higher pay because the lower rate of tax applies in one case and the higher rate of tax in the other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">As outlined in the framework document the Taoiseach has argued for a system of social partnership that would spread the burden in a social solidarity pact.  Instead of that the inverse has happened.  He has come into the House with a package of proposals that is purely a tax on income.  It is an income levy not a pension levy.  It imposes disproportionately on people from €15,000 a year.  At €30,000 a year — can anybody in this House imagine living on €30,000 a year — the levy will be €1,750.  On €50,000 it will be €3,750.  Is that fair in the circumstances in which we find ourselves?</p>
          <p eId="para_245">It is ridiculous when we organise the business of this House that on an issue of such importance, when we are staring economic crisis in the face, Members of this House who want to contribute to this debate and deal with the issues raised by the Government have five minutes to make a contribution.  We need to distinguish between the debates that matter in the House and the ones that are less important.  We need to give the Members of the House the opportunity to contribute in a thoughtful, considered and coherent way to offering solutions to address the crisis we now face.  The way this debate is structured does not offer that opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I believe that five minutes is plenty.  I want to make two proposals to the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  In this time of unprecedented financial and fiscal challenge, which is affecting every economy in the western world, we need to act in solidarity as a nation.  As part of the public reform process the Taoiseach should establish a new Department of public service innovation.  The biggest challenge facing the country is the objective of delivering services efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I have been fortunate to have served in seven different Departments.  The public servants who work there are excellent people who work hard.  However, the structures and system in which they operate make things almost impossible.  The best civil servants should be drawn from across the spectrum to staff this new Department.  People from the private sector who are expert in change management should be introduced in exchange for public servants going out.  There should be a radical and fundamental reform of the public service from the top down and more importantly from the bottom up, including the local authorities, HSE and other agencies delivering services.  Quangos need to be eliminated.  This recession offers an ideal opportunity to undertake innovative work in public service reform.  It is the civil and public servants who should lead that.  There are no better people to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">My second proposal is that the Minister for Finance should invite representatives from Labour and Fine Gael to the Department of Finance and open up the books to let them see the precise situation.  This will let them have the opportunity——</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I am trying to be positive about today because life goes on.  It has been a very gloomy week in the Dáil as I said last night.  At the same time we need to be upbeat about some aspects and we need to keep going about our business.  If it is difficult being a Fianna Fáil Deputy in Dublin South-West at the moment, as far as I am concerned I still need to do my job and that is what I will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">In that context I was reading <i>The Echo</i> with my breakfast this morning, as I do.  It reminded me that I attended the opening of a new restaurant, Kennedy’s restaurant in High Street.  For some strange reason three restaurants have opened in High Street in Tallaght since Christmas, two Chinese restaurants and now Kennedy’s.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I do not deny that things are difficult but if that is not good news, I do not know what is.  It is important to state this even from the Government benches.  In my political and community life, I have always tried to be positive about my constituency and the need for job creation.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country and the wider Dublin South-West region needs investment and jobs.  Over the past couple of weeks, one has been afraid to say anything in this House unless it is about the need for jobs in Limerick — which is fair enough.  I note there was a lot of talk at the weekend about the need for employment in Donegal which is also fair enough.  Every Deputy in this House will speak with passion about his or her own constituency but I am not afraid to talk passionately about Dublin South-West and it is important to continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">A number of colleagues have referred to the excellent work of the Oireachtas Library research service, and I know others have suggested that it should be abolished, but last week the research service published a number of constituency profiles and I read those relating to Wexford — where I have family connections.  Of particular interest was the profile on Dublin South-West.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I wish to highlight both the mixed messages and also the positive messages which are recorded in respect of my constituency:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_285">This profile is based on the Census of Population 2006...The profile reveals that Dublin South-West has a number of notable differences when compared to the State as a whole. These include: The average age of the population in Dublin South-West is below the national average and the share of the population aged 65 years and older is well below the national average.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">My constituency has a very young population.  The profile further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_287">People in Dublin South-West are slightly more likely to have left education earlier and with fewer qualifications than people nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">This is an aspect which should be of concern.  The profile further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_289">People in Dublin South-West are more likely to be at work than the national average. They are much less likely to have retired.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">This is a very interesting fact which may come as a surprise to many.  The profile further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_291">The share of the Dublin South-West workforce in professional occupations is well below average and Dublin South-West people are more likely to work in clerical and transport occupations.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_292">Households in Dublin South-West are more likely to have access to a computer and broadband Internet access than households nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I acknowledge the many calls I and many other colleagues are receiving. Overnight, I have received calls from workers in Tallaght who work for the county council, the hospital or various agencies.  I am listening to what they are saying and I will certainly represent their views.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">Fine Gael has been critical of the Government for not taking action and for delaying action on bringing spending under control so we welcome the fact that action has finally been taken.  However, we have serious concerns about the action and the extent of it.  We were told the pensions levy would account for almost three quarters of the total take but in my view it is taking a disproportionate amount from the lower paid.  I contend that the contributions to pensions, including Members' pensions, still make for great value and even allowing for the increase these are pensions that could not be bought on the open market.  Nevertheless, it is unfair on young people on very modest incomes.  Such people may have made financial commitments and have bought houses and have planned their expenditure for a mortgage, perhaps borrowing funds to decorate the house or for school fees.  People have made commitments and to now make changes of the order of this magnitude is grossly unfair, particularly for young people starting out.  People need certainty and there is no certainty.  They do not expect such change to come from the Government, for the Government to pull the rug from under their feet.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I am also concerned at the magnitude of the pension take as a percentage of earnings.  It is very difficult to ask people to do their patriotic duty and pay this levy when the money is going into the black hole of completely unreformed Government spending.  How can I go out and say to a young teacher or a young nurse who has just qualified and who has taken on a mortgage for an apartment bought at the height of the market, that his or her money, their contribution of €4,000 or €6,000 in the pension levy, is going to be used to store e-voting machines or to buy a box in Thomond Park for some quango or to perpetuate some quango whose purpose has long since been forgotten?  It is indefensible to take people's money and to continue to spend it in the same old wasteful way, with no attempt to restructure the way spending decisions are made or to tackle and root out spending programmes that have long outlived their usefulness.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">FÁS is one organisation that certainly needs to be reformed.  The Taoiseach has stated that there could be 400,000 unemployed by the end of the year.  What is happening in FÁS?  It has a budget of €1 billion.  Back in the 1980s FÁS provided literacy courses and community employment schemes for the unemployed and these were satisfactory for that time.  However, the people losing their jobs now are already highly educated.  How is FÁS planning to deal with such people who are now unemployed?  Who will retrain the architects, the bankers, the Dell workers and the quantity surveyors, who are being thrown onto the job market daily and in huge numbers?  I have no confidence that the Government has done anything to gear up FÁS or whether it even realises there is a problem.  Deputy Fahey identified the problem and his solution was to set up another quango.  Are they for real on the other side of the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_299">For weeks the Government has been telling the House that the Government would reduce the expenditure bill by €2 billion this year and by €4 billion next year.  Does the Government think it will be easier next year to cut back spending?</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Surely the Government cannot think it will be easier.  Does it not realise that the longer it is postponed, the greater the cost of borrowing?  It now emerges that even the €2 billion is not being saved.  The Government may not have taken into account the deflationary effect but it certainly did not take into account the fact of the tax relief which is not a full tax relief.  It is stated in today's newspapers that the take will only be €0.75 billion.  The Government huffed and puffed and brought forth a mouse in the end, as Deputy Kenny said, and it will be back to us within a couple of months looking for more money.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Certainly I cannot do the kind of damage in three minutes that the Government has managed to do in the past six of seven years.  I was amazed to hear a Government backbencher suggesting that the Opposition should be invited in to see the books which are in a complete mess and the country is broke.  The country is now bankrupt and the Government is looking for suggestions from the Opposition.  It did not invite anyone over, even though the Opposition advised it five, six and seven years ago.  The Opposition was told it was stupid, that those of us on these benches were prophets of doom and did not know what we were talking about; now it knows as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Deputy Mitchell made the point that there is not a hope on earth of taking €4 billion out of this economy next year or any other year from here on in and ensure the country is still surviving.  Even the people over there must know this by now.  No regard has been taken of the fact that a significant number of families bought houses at exorbitant prices, took out huge mortgages in the past six or seven years and pay child minding fees in order that both parents can go to work to pay for the mortgage.  There is not a hope on earth that they will survive in the climate that will be created.  Deputy Rabbitte and others have referred to the so-called pensions levy.  This is not a pensions levy as it has nothing to do with pensions; it is a complete retrenchment, a hitting back at the unfortunate public.  It is a penalty which the public will have to pay for through the nose and it is a swingeing attack on people who are totally innocent, who did not contribute to this situation but who unfortunately followed Government policy to such an extent that now they are paying the price.  It is an appalling situation and I do not know that the people fully realise the magnitude of the likely impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The notion is that this proposal will stabilise the economy but it will have the opposite effect.  It will break the backs of the people, the economy and, more worryingly, it will do nothing for the competitiveness of this economy which is the area in which we have lost out most seriously.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_306">It is easy to blame someone else for one's mistakes but we should remember that less than two years ago we were one of the wealthiest countries in the world.  What went wrong?  How could a small country like ours fall so hard so fast in such a short time?</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I listened yesterday to the debate and it struck me that everybody now appears to be singing off the same hymn sheet.  We are in a crisis but the crisis was not made by the men and women who have lost their jobs in recent months or the less well off.  It was made by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">There are two reasons this small country of ours is in crisis, the first of which is greed.  I am taken aback by the Minister of State's laughter.  I heard in disbelief yesterday about the amount of money paid to bankers and top executives — money people in communities would never see in their lifetime.  That money was paid out with no reason or accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Some Deputies in the debate last night said how sorry they were about the thousands of jobs that have been lost.  Saying sorry is not good enough, particularly for the family living beside me with two young children.  The mother has lost her job.  The father has been put on a three day week and they are left with a mortgage of €530,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">This Government spent and spent without thinking of the rainy day.  Money has been poured into projects where bricks and mortar were more important than human life or communities, and developers became rich.  The Government spent as if there was no tomorrow but tomorrow has come.  Most housewives know that they can only spend what is in their purse and when that is gone they have nothing else and they are in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Deputy Kennedy said earlier that the Opposition should come up with ideas.  The Opposition has been coming up with ideas for the past few months.  Deputies Bruton, Coveney and many other members of Fine Gael have brought various motions to the floor of this Chamber and all of them were rejected, even the one last night.  It is about time the Government listened to the Opposition if it wants to know how we can get out of this crisis.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
          <p eId="para_312">I have the same level of interest in helping secure the future of this country as any Member of the House, including Opposition Members, but I do not play the political tactic of apportioning blame.  It is important to remember that we are not just governed by our own political thinking or economic strategy.  Outside forces are having an effect also, and I do not say that in the context of trying to spread the blame among outside forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I welcome this debate.  In recent months one would have got the impression that ours was the only economy in the world suffering a recession.  When I hear commentators make the political complaint that the Government is not giving leadership I wonder if those same commentators ever look at our own political apparatus and ignore what is happening worldwide.  I refer to the major economic difficulties in the powerhouse of Europe, Germany, and the similar difficulties being experienced in France, the United States of America and the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I am not one for Opposition bashing but for members of the Opposition to comment on the public record that this country is bankrupt represents a bankruptcy of ideas among Opposition members.  This Government is in a process of trying to assure international bankers, investors and the International Monetary Fund that we are in control of our economy.  My response to the comment that this Government failed to give leadership is that if leadership is about offering a soundbite, a smile for a camera or a quick solution without any strategic planning it is about short-term politics.  It is certainly not strategic and is the opposite of what the Taoiseach has shown in the past few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">It is a pity the talks with the social partners, condemned by the Opposition, did not succeed, although I understand the reason.  On the one hand we are accused by Fine Gael of wasting time and Labour accuses us of not spending enough time talking to the social partners.  The process this Government engaged upon involving all the partners was the proper political and, more importantly, economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Having gone through that process the Government is now forced, as it were, to bring in serious economic strategies that will affect many people.  I regret that people in the public sector believe they are being singled out but many of the concerns of the private sector have not been reflected in this House.  The difficulty of having to deal with a loss of income or a reduction in income pales into insignificance when I hear of people who have lost jobs in the private sector.  In that context, when we take into account the budgetary strategy and realise the shortfall in tax revenue, it behoves Members to realise the Government must take the action it is now taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I find it difficult when people dismiss Government speakers with a wave of their hand and say they are putting together their summation of the economy, and then rush to judgment by suggesting money has been wasted in recent years.  I have yet to hear an Opposition spokesperson outline where the money has been wasted, with the exception of the storage of the electronic voting machines.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">If I could continue without being interrupted, there has been major investment in housing in the past 15 years.  People talk about high mortgages, and I accept that, but I recall the days when there were very long housing lists.  I can now speak of funding for public housing, voluntary housing and social housing.  There has been major investment in our roads infrastructure in the past 15 years.  I want to record also the huge increase in investment in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Many strategies were brought before this House in the past few years and the position now, and it is not by our own creation, is that we are facing a worldwide economic recession affecting every economic powerhouse in Europe and the United States.  One would think from listening to the Members in this House that that economic recession was brought about by this Government and that it affected Wall Street, the City of London, Paris and elsewhere.  This is a world recession and this Government is dealing with it in the way it is expected to do so, not with the support of many on the opposite side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Nevertheless, Government's responsibility is to govern and to give leadership and I am pleased to say this Government has outlined its programme, not just for this year but for the next four years.  The difficulty for governments is that they must take unpopular decisions but they have done that.  At the same time we cannot have an unpopular strategy of rushing into this House and picking and choosing where the least difficulties could occur when reducing expenditure.  Consistent within the Government's programme in the past few months is the need to secure support across the social partners.  That did not work out and we have now reached the point where the Government must effect those savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">We must take into account the domestic pressures not just on the Irish economy but also by way of the contraction of enterprise worldwide.  I reject the accusation that we depended far too much on the construction industry.  This country has benefited from private enterprise involved in risk taking.  We have a standard of housing we never had previously and if people believe we should have invested in some other quarter and not recognised the huge demand pre-1980s for modern facilities and housing, I would point to what has been achieved in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In framing this position the Government recently published the revised forecast for the period 2008-13.  It showed that without corrective action, the general Government deficit for each of the years to 2013 would have been approximately between 11% and 12% of gross domestic product.  The Government is prioritising the elimination of the current budget deficit by 2013 and bringing the general Government deficit below 3% of gross domestic product.  Doing this in a shorter period would be so great a shock to the economy as to be counterproductive.  Following the end of the partnership talks in Government Buildings, the Government has clearly shown leadership in dealing with the public finances.  It has not introduced a quick fix but is strategically managing them.  The cuts being proposed for the next four years will return us to a position in which we can generate our own wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The issue of the national debt is also a factor in driving the Government's policy.  The Exchequer funding requirement for 2009 is €23 billion, comprising a budget deficit of €18 billion and the re-financing of a maturing bond of €5 billion in April.  The Government has already secured €6 billion of this year's requirement though the issuance of a five year bond in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The House should not be at cross purposes in dealing with the economy.  I believe in the call made on budget day by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that we should be patriotic in how we deal with the public finances and the economic problems affecting not just this country but the world.  I appeal to Members not to make speeches for the sake of being critical of the Government but to bear in mind we are in this together.  This is not a self-created difficulty caused by any one party in the House but reflects the worldwide economic downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The Taoiseach has the ability and the stamina to show us the way forward and bring the economy with him.  I appreciate the approach to tackling the problem has been honest rather than through soundbites, photo shoots or spin.  The people have been given a clear direction as to how to deal with the economic downturn.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">Yesterday I was taken by the Minister for Finance's claim that he will continue to target expenditure and tax measures on those most able to bear the cost.  Who is most able to bear the cost?  According to the Minister, it is those earning €15,000 per annum.  That wage is significantly below the minium wage.  How, under any criteria, could that category of earner be described as those best able to bear the burden?  It is the most ridiculous assertion I have ever heard and I would like the Minister to explain it.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">This week I spent some time with 480 workers at Waterford Crystal, many of whom have been made redundant.  They will be part of the 37,000 made redundant since Christmas.  The Government talks about the knowledge economy and innovation but where is the job retention strategy?  In the case of Waterford Crystal, hundreds of workers have proved over many decades that they have a world class product and brand.  While we are talking about all that is good in Ireland, insufficient moves are being made by the Government to save their jobs.  Job retention is at least as important as job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Yesterday, for the first time in months, the Minister for Finance spoke about job creation but where is the Government's strategy?  Will the Minister tell us of one single idea for job creation the Government produced in the past 12 months?</p>

Yet, we have not heard one new idea on job creation from the Government or even seen the allocation of one extra euro into job creation strategies, helping enterprises to create new jobs and entrepreneurs start new businesses.  This is most unfortunate.  A one-stop-shop needs to be established among all the job creation and training agencies to facilitate entrepreneurs coming forward with excellent ideas for employment and business.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">Following this week's events, it is important we praise the many excellent teachers, gardaí, nurses, doctors and other workers in the public sector.  The pension levy is not a levy but a tax on those in the public sector.  It is similar to the 1% earnings levy introduced in the budget.  Again, the pension levy has unfairly targeted the wrong people, that is the younger members of the Civil Service and the public service who bought houses at expensive rates and have a higher level of personal indebtedness as a result.  The Government has got it wrong again.  Fianna Fáil and the Greens are unbelievably out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Public sector managers, such as superintendents in the Garda and directors of services in the local authorities, should be allowed to manage properly.  They are being prevented from doing so because of the "use it or lose it" philosophy in the public sector.  By this I mean when an annual budget allocation is not drawn down fully, the following year the benefit of the same amount is not given.  It is a ridiculous situation in which public service managers find themselves.  They should be allowed to make cuts in areas in which they know there is waste with a guarantee of their subsequent budget allocations not being reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Cutting public sector pay by 7% does not provide the opportunity to cut out bad practices in the public sector.  Local authorities must now apply for discharge licences from the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is a case of one State agency applying to another for a licence.  Wexford County Council has estimated these licences will cost it €1 million.  Multiply that by the number of local authorities in the State and one sees a large amount of waste.  There are many other examples of waste that need to be cut out.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">The 329,000 people who are unemployed are not being treated properly.  They must wait in queues every day to get some information on their benefits and weeks to get a few euro to pay their bills and feed their families.  The Government did nothing in its announcement on Tuesday to address this situation.  It must establish units — be it in a hotel or other location — in every town, such as Trim, Navan and Kells, to give people access to information on unemployment benefits.  We were promised extra staff would be put in place to deal with the increase in benefit applications.  These people must be looked after because they are the most important people in our community at this stage.  They must not go to England, Australia or America.  The Minister must put money in place for these people, who are made up from my family, the Minister's family and everybody's family.  People should get up off their butts and help.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I do not know who was advising the other day but anybody in business knows that if one part of a business is thriving, one does not take the two feet from under it.  That is what we did the other day when we depressed the matter further.  The Government forced families on middle incomes to make the decision of whether they are better on the dole or working.  A man on €60,000 a year with four or five kids, with one or two going to college, is losing €5,000 a year or €100 a week.  He would be better off on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">What was done in Germany after the First World War?  They did not go into depression but rather found work for their people.  They did the very same after the Second World War, finding work for the people and giving them an incentive to get up in the morning and rebuild.  We could rebuild this country as we have only half done it.  Our roads are a mess and we could be using our railways much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The buck has been passed to the public sector in trying to get us out with this €2 billion but that is not worth tuppence.  It will not be nearly enough to bail us out.  The banks are currently controlling us and they are calling for property taxes.  Yet they are doing nothing for the people who left this country and will crucify the people who bought property here.  Where is the penalty for the people who got €10 million or €15 million to build luxury homes and golf courses abroad?  Fianna Fáil has let down every working class person in this country and what it did the other day was the end for the rebuilding of this country.  The Government should get out, give people work and look after the people who are unemployed until they get work.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I understood I had five minutes.  I am delighted to support the Government proposal because no alternative has been put forward.  We are being watched and measured by international financiers as Ireland is in the borrowing cage once more.  We are borrowing substantial money across the world and if we do not have our house in order, as well as a disciplined and protected economy, we will pay substantial interest rates that will add to our national problems.  I fully support the measures by the Government and if there is a alternative, I would like to hear the Opposition put it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">There is much I could say if I had more time.  Hard decisions must be taken and if we are not careful over the next five or six years, the national debt could be expanded significantly.  I will not quote the figure because I do not want to frighten people.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Payments made to people both in the public and private sector in the form of bonuses and severances must be curtailed if we are to get the support of the ordinary people on the street who must accept 2%, 3% or even a zero pay increase.  In the past ten years there has been privatisation, share options and bonuses that were not in the best interest of the community.  I stated this last July in another speech I made and this is where we have really gone wrong.  We expect working or poor people to take limited wages and salaries, and this must change.  There should be discipline in the higher levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I am very critical of the handling of Anglo Irish Bank, which has destroyed Ireland's image in the eyes of people and our society.  People have been quite critical across the world about the way it was handled.  I supported the Government in voting but I have a personal view on the bank.  It should have been liquidated and thrown to the wolves.  Anglo Irish Bank was only an agency — it had no clearing facilities and did not want to see the likes of me or the Ceann Comhairle because it was not interested in our business.  It was interested in big business speculators who have left us high and dry and destroyed our national banking system.  It has destroyed two banks which have served the country since the founding of the State, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, which was formed by a merger of the Royal Bank of Ireland, the Munster and Leinster Bank and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I have a strong view on the recapitalisation of the banks.  This is being done to throw more money to speculators and expand the economy.  I have heard from ten or 11 constituents in the past three or four months who had difficulties with banks.  When I investigated and rang a bank official I was told he could not talk to me.  In the past four or five weeks I have changed the system and I get a letter from them.  Most of these people had difficulties in the good times so will we add to the misery with the €2 billion or €4 billion in recapitalisation?  We might be better off giving it to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  One bank has said it might need all that capital.  The banks should be allowed work through the system and write off the debts over the three-year period, which they have done in the past.  A domestic recession was brought about by narrowing our tax base four, five or six years ago and leaving speculators get away with murder.  Mr. Seán Dunne was paying €400 million for property because we had no proper capital gains tax on big developers, which we should have.  It was grand for people like the Ceann Comhairle and Deputies Pat Rabbitte and Tony Killeen to have the 20% rate because they are small fry.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We expanded programmes and people went wild.  Farmers down the country in villages and towns were selling land at a €1 million for a few acres.  There was not even a pipe or wall on such land.  Speculation drove the price to €10 million or more but only a small amount of tax would have been paid.  If the State had received a substantial take from that land we would have equity across the system and no difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">A great discussion is taking place in this country currently on Deputies' salaries and expenses.  The commission we have set up here is a monopoly and monster which must be controlled.  This House has gone out of control.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission was introduced to euphoria because people thought it was a great idea.  I was a lone voice that was laughed at when I said it was going to cost a fortune to run it.  I was proven right but the Deputies' expenses will now pay for it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_359">There is little good news to speak about.  I welcome that my Green Party colleagues and I played a part in securing additional funding for schools, home insulation and projects that will create jobs.  I am happy overseas aid was not cut by as much as it could have been and the fact that a little humanity was shown in that mathematically viable cuts — such as abolishing the social welfare and pension Christmas bonus — did not materialise in the end, thank God.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">This is bad news and nobody should be happy about it.  At best we should be relieved that the cuts announced in the national interest have helped stabilise what is left of our international financial standing.  We might be in a position, for the time being, to continue borrowing, paying people's salaries, stimulating job recovery and allowing banks to lend to help that recovery, no matter what we think of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The majority of the cutbacks come from an increased contribution from the public sector.  There has been a nasty campaign in some quarters to vilify public service workers who have provided this country with great service over the years.  However, the fundamental truth is the public sector must take on the same burden as the private sector.  I have spoken to many people in the private sector who have been deeply affected — I have a friend who was let go; my cousin, a barman, has had to take a 10% pay cut; and my friend's dad, who is 30 years in a company, has had to take a 15% pay cut.  I have heard of 25% pay cuts.  It is really bad in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The boss of the public sector, the Government, is now indicating that those employed must take a pay cut.  From speaking to constituents in the public sector, they feel the cuts are unfair.  They are graded towards making the higher-paid pay more but some feel it unfair because ordinary public service workers and private workers feel that fat cats, bankers, developers and the political decision makers have not taken their fair share of the burden.  If they caused the mess, why are they not paying for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The trouble is that those who messed up no longer have the money so we must pay for their greed and, to a lesser extent, our own greed as a nation.  I hope those who caused this get their comeuppance and I hope history and the electorate will judge those who made the political decisions which caused our decline to be worse than the global norm.  I will welcome the day when those who showed more favour to the political donors and vested interests than to the citizens in their care are told, in no uncertain terms, where to go.  However, today is not that day.  Now is not the time for apportioning blame because, like it or not, stability is required.  There is a job to be done, in the national interest, for all of our citizens.  We must make tough and unpopular decisions because we know that if do not do so, matters would be far worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">It is incumbent on us, as civic leaders, to lead by example.  I welcome the fact that Oireachtas Members will be cutting back on expenses.  I also welcome the political forum to which the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, Deputies John Gormley and Brian Lenihan, referred.  However, there is also a need for real movement on corporate donations.  It is not good enough for politicians from all parties to accept donations from developers, bankers and trade unions.  The people who need a dig-out are ordinary citizens, not those in the body politic.  Let us lead by example.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">The most sobering aspect of this debate relates to the appalling figures released by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in respect of unemployment.  Proposals have not yet been put forward with regard to the immediate restoration of the flow of credit to small businesses which may, as a result of overdraft restrictions, be forced to cease their operations for want of such credit and working capital.  When the Minister addressed the House in respect of banking, he indicated that the banks had made commitments to extend the level of borrowing to SMEs by 30% and 10% in different categories.  That is simply not happening.  What initiatives is the Government taking to restore the flow of credit?</p>
          <p eId="para_371">When the Taoiseach made his announcement on Tuesday last, he did not refer to money being set aside to deal with job retention.  Numerous proposals have been floated in respect of social insurance relief, schemes for export and special guarantees regarding risks taken on by businesses.  What money has the Minister set aside to make provision in respect of such proposals?</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Will the €2 billion reduction in borrowing to be made on foot of the measures announced on Tuesday be achieved in the current year?  A gross figure of €2 billion has been provided, but there are several leakages from that.  The first of these relates to the fact that the pension levy is tax allowable.  The second is that once spending is removed, there will be an immediate reduction in the tax take.  The third is that some of these proposals — forecast to result in savings to the tune of almost €300 million — will not come into effect this year.  I calculate that the impact on borrowing of the Government's package of measures will be closer to €1 billion.  Will the Minister comment on this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Is the Minister open to changes in the pension levy that would provide for people at the bottom of the scale who will derive little benefit from State pensions?  Would he be open to changes that would removed anomalies in the structure whereby some people on low incomes, particularly between €30,000 and €50,000, will pay higher net levies than those on higher incomes?  Why have proper budgetary papers not been forthcoming from the Department of Finance?  There has been no disaggregation of tax forecasts, no profile of spending or taxation for the coming months and no information regarding the impact of the Government's measures in year one, year two and year three, which is extraordinary.  Why have such papers not been issued?</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Will the reports from Mr. Colm McCarthy be issued prior to decisions being made?  Will there be a rolling flow of decisions from the Minister throughout the year or will all the various decisions be deferred until next year's budget?  The position with regard to the latter has not been made clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Are renegotiations other than those relating to professional fees taking place?  I refer, for example, to renegotiations in respect of rents paid by the State.  Have the results of the work carried out by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, in respect of public procurement been factored in?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_376">Deputy Bruton posed a vast range of questions to which I will attempt to provide answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">It must be borne in mind that Tuesday's announcement by the Taoiseach related to a Government decision regarding financial stability in the State.  This is the first decisive step towards securing our financial stability, but it builds on two earlier steps taken in October's budget and in the initial announcement last July.  I appreciate that there has been much criticism of the fact that these latter steps were superseded by events because the deterioration in the public financial position was so serious.  The fact remains that those earlier decisions were of great assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The move in July of last year to target public expenditure and bring in the various Accounting Officers and Ministers in order that a Government decision might be made in respect of reductions began the process of financial stabilisation.  That process would have been far more difficult if an initial decision of that nature had not been taken last July.  It was important that this decision was taken and that a number of areas of waste and inefficiency in the public service were immediately identified.  The savings envisaged in the context of that initial decision were realised last year and will continue to be realised this year.  The work of the group chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, forms part of the process in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The budget was criticised when it was introduced.  However, the Government made a number of extremely difficult decisions in respect of public expenditure which does not relate to the payroll side in the budget.  Those decisions were important and essential in the context of ensuring that the various programmes delivered by the Government could be cut as much as possible and that expenditure in respect of them would be kept to the absolute minimum.  As a result of these decisions, substantial savings have already been factored into the figures for public expenditure for 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">With the further deterioration in financial circumstances last year, the Government decided to examine and evaluate the position in January.  The priority was to ensure financial stability by the taking of a decisive step in respect of payroll costs.  The balance of the savings to be made as a result of the measures announced by the Government on Tuesday last relates to such costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The essential purpose of the most recent decision taken by the Government is to stabilise the public finances this year.  This is a vital first step.  As a result of the deterioration in the public finances, there has been a major escalation in our borrowing requirement for 2009.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has sufficient funds to service the needs of the State this year and there is no immediate difficulty.  However, it would be unsustainable to allow the current position to obtain, year on year, after 2009.  It is essential to send out a strong signal that we intend to get our borrowing under control.  That is why I briefed the European Commission on the matter at a recent bilateral meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Given the scale of the problem, the Government has set a five-year framework to address it.  The reality, however, is that economic prophesy for 2011, 2012 and 2013 is an extraordinarily hazardous science in present circumstances.  What Ireland needs to do this year is show we can get our public expenditure under control in a decisive manner and effect a major reduction in the borrowing requirement for 2010.  The decision announced by the Government on Tuesday is the first step in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">On Deputy Bruton's question on small and medium size enterprises, while this is an important issue which the Government is addressing, it is not one we addressed in our decision last Tuesday because the vital decision that had to be made on Tuesday was to take decisive action to reduce the overheads of the public service.  That decisive macro-economic action was needed to give Ireland credibility in the world outside and at home.  I welcome the widespread welcome financial commentators have given to the announcement.  It is a clear sign that everyone understands that the Government is moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">In regard to how we build on that in macro-economic terms, the next clear step is the work of the expenditure control group.  Deputy Bruton stated the Government had outsourced decisions on expenditure control.  That is far from the case.  The chairman of the group is an integral part of my Department where he assists my officials and me in our work.  The purpose of the expenditure control group is to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Finance in the whole business of expenditure control.  The decision to invite the group to assist the Department was made so as the Estimates process for next year can begin now.  This process, which, as Deputies are aware, normally beings in the middle of the year, is now beginning for next year.  This will give us more time to identify the savings and adjustments which can be made as early as possible in order that current expenditure for next year is reduced to an absolute minimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The Deputy also asked whether it was envisaged that further savings would be made this year.  If, in the course of the work of my Department and the expenditure control group, areas can be identified where immediate savings can be made, this will be done.  The Government took care, in arriving at this particular decision, to ensure the sums which were indicated as savings this year were cast iron in terms of their capacity to generate savings.  Clearly, if further savings emerge during the year, they will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">In stabilising the public finances it is essential that we also review our capital commitments for next year.  This review process will be conducted by my officials and me in the course of the year.  If capital issues arise in the course of the expenditure control group's work, they will be taken up by myself and my officials and analysed carefully.  I look forward to the publication, early in the autumn, of the report of the Commission on Taxation.  I hope this report will inform a public debate about how we can broaden our tax base and ensure everyone bears, in a fair manner, the adjustment which must take place.  This is very important work and will be built upon in this year's budget and in terms of the taxation arrangements we put in place for 2010.  There is, therefore, a determined plan of action to effect a substantial reduction in our borrowing requirement in the course of this year and leave Ireland in a much healthier position in 2010 than in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">On the Deputy's specific question on credit, I explained that decisions on credit must in any event be made by the Government.  As we are all aware, a worldwide credit squeeze is under way and is affecting small and medium size businesses in Ireland as much as in any other part of the world.  When the capitalisation programme was announced in December the Government negotiated with the relevant financial institutions certain arrangements in regard to the advance of credit by these institutions to small and medium size businesses for agreeing mortgages and home purchase.  This has not been put into operation because the capitalisation has not yet taken place.  One of the reasons for this is that the markets have deteriorated since the original announcement and the banks are not in a position to raise the €1 billion they indicated they would raise by way of private investment.  The banks are now engaged in intensive negotiations with the Government to finalise the capitalisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I have heard much criticism inside and outside the House about bail-outs of financial institutions.  The incontestable fact is that not a solitary cent or euro of taxpayers' money has been expended to date in investment in the banking sector.  The decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank meant that an immediate investment of €1.5 billion in that institution was averted.  I am pleased to report that to date the taxpayer has not had to provide working capital for Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Discussions on capitalisation for Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks are ongoing.  I have seen criticism that these discussions have taken too much time.  We have seen in other countries how capitalisation discussions have led to decisions which have had to be reversed, amended or changed with the passage of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">For the past few weeks, I have heard a cry in the public press that some form of risk insurance should be provided for financial institutions, whereby in return for an up-front payment the Exchequer would expose itself to absorbing the losses of these institutions in future.  I read this morning that the authors of the proposal, which originated in the United Kingdom, have decided not to proceed with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">We are proceeding in the correct way in banking matters because we need to get this right.  We are following the Swedish example.  The first step taken in Sweden was to guarantee the institutions without qualification, which is what Ireland did on 30 September last year.  The second step taken by the Swedish authorities during their crisis in the early 1990s was to examine the structure of the institutions to ascertain whether they should be nationalised, capitalised or left in private hands.  While the bulk of these institutions were nationalised, the conditions in different countries vary.  In the case of Ireland, we have nationalised one of the institutions and will capitalise the two principal institutions.  Discussions on this matter are not yet complete.  Risk is the next matter which will require to be addressed following capitalisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">I will first ask the Minister a couple of general questions before addressing the issue of the levy.  The table provided by the Department on prospective savings states that total current and capital savings under the programme will be €2 billion this year.  Under the heading on the 8% reduction in professional fees, an example is given of "Medical and Legal".  What does this mean?  To take the case of a person who is currently charged for a private visit to a doctor, will his or her €60 fee be reduced by 8%?  Will all doctors reduce fees by 8%?</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Is this a direct reduction in fees paid to doctors and lawyers working for the Government on Government contracts?  Will they have a reduction of 8% across the board?  Does the reduction apply to those working in tribunals?  I recall valiant efforts, starting with former Ministers Charlie McCreevy and Michael McDowell and others, who all said the fees of tribunal lawyers would be reduced.  I think there was a promise made that they would be reduced during the 2004 local election but they were never reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">What legal and medical practitioner fees will be reduced?  If, for example, as is suggested in one newspaper today, medical fees from the State are reduced, instead of a reduction in fees from my GP, could I face an increase because the doctors will be authorised to recover their loss of State income from private patients?  It is important to clarify that matter, particularly for people in the middle income sectors who, by and large, do not have access to medical cards or free medical facilities from the State at the point of use, although they pay tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">My second general question is on heading five of the announcement, a general administrative reduction in Government costs of €140 million.  There will be all-party agreement on this question.  Does the Minister have proposals included in that heading to reduce the number of Ministers of State and Oireachtas committees?  Everybody in the Opposition parties would be happy to sit down and see an across the board package that would refer to Ministers of State because we believe the number could be reduced by one third or one half.  The Government would work better.  One would not have to try to remember the names of the five Ministers of State in the Department of Education and Science or those in the Department of Health and Children.  It would make work in Government much easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The committees would be better if almost all of the paid positions were abolished or reduced by at least two thirds.  Almost everybody, including the Minister's own backbenchers, want to make committees work better.  There are too many of them; understanding what they do is very confusing and we do not even have enough rooms to service them all.  There is competition in booking rooms by the gaggle of committees.  We would be prepared to co-operate with such a measure and I am sure the other Opposition parties would also be happy to do so.  Can the Minister make his proposals clear to us?  Would he meet the Opposition to discuss them because we would be willing to discuss them with him?</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The same could be said about Deputies' expenses.  If there was a general discussion, the Minister would have no difficulty in reaching agreement across the House with political parties.  I am offering it and trying to be positive.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">Let us return to what is described as a pension-related deduction.  I asked the Minister for a private briefing from him or his officials on whether this would be subject to tax relief.  The Taoiseach said in his statement that the gross amount was €1.4 billion.  My view, which I put to the Minister privately, was that it would have to be deductible for tax purposes.  The statement by the Department of Finance on its website showed that it will be subject to tax deductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">A difficulty arises in describing the exact nature of this measure.  Is in an income levy or a pension levy?  We have clear anomalies in the levy.  A middle-ranking public servant who earns a middle-ranking salary will, after tax, have a lesser take on the net levy than a person at the lower end of the scale of Civil Service payments.

          <p eId="para_413">Is the levy calculated on all of a public servant's income?  In other words, is it calculated on one's basic, overtime, special allowances and weekend allowances?  Is it calculated on bonuses, such as the 10% paid to assistant general secretaries and above?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The issue of our troops serving in Chad was raised by my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea.  When they are on UN service, as the Minister knows, they receive a daily allowance which is paid for by Ireland via the UN.  Will it be subject to the levy?  Many of the soldiers concerned are raising queries about it and we do not, as yet, have clarification.  I would be grateful if the Minister could enlighten us.  If he cannot give us the information now, could he set it out in some detail after the debate?</p>

          <p eId="para_416">Regarding medical and legal fees, it relates to Government contracts and arrangements in connection with them.  It will require legislation because the State is, in effect, altering contractual or legal arrangements.  It will apply to all medical and legal professionals, so in principle it will apply to persons who act at tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The question of whether private clients of a professional person who has a dual practice can be affected by this misses the point about the demonstration effect of what this announcement is about.  It is about improving competitiveness in the economy and the public sector must lead the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">If the public sector is leading the way in the market pricing of service, the private market must also respond.  The relevant professionals cannot compensate themselves at the expense of the public sector by increasing the extent of their remuneration.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">It is a matter for the private market that exists.  One can go to a different doctor if necessary.  It is essential that we tackle costs throughout our economy.  It is the one clear economic message in this announcement.  We must reduce our costs.  It is not just a matter for the public sector.  If necessary legislation is needed to restore competitiveness to sheltered private sectors, the necessary action must be taken as a follow-on from this announcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">On the issue of Oireachtas committees and Ministers of State, I welcome the tone of what was said by Deputy Burton.  I think she appreciates that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is now charged on the Central Fund.  It is like the establishment of the President.  It is independent of the Department of Finance.  The arrangement was put in place precisely because it was alleged that the Department of Finance, as an arm of the Executive, was constantly interfering in the autonomy and independence the Oireachtas should have.  I invite Opposition parties to work with the parties in Government, through the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, to secure the necessary savings which should be secured in the expense of the Oireachtas.</p>

I welcome the spirit of what was said by Deputy Burton and I am sure the different parties will work together on the commission in the national interest to secure the necessary savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Its budget is tri-annual and it will be reviewed this year because we are coming to the end of a three-year period.  The special group on expenditure control is examining it and other items in the Central Fund in that context.  Regarding savings this year, I would very much welcome the proposals of Opposition parties on what savings can be procured.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The position on the expenses of Deputies and Senators is that I can, by legislation, vary them but the constitutional convention must be that I do so after hearing the views of the commission.  I am an adjunct to it in that respect, and necessarily so, and cannot unilaterally impose a change in the absence of <i>force majeure</i> extraordinary circumstances.</p>

Regarding Ministers of State, the Taoiseach made it clear in the House yesterday that everybody has to work in the current crisis, including Ministers of State.  They will have to work in this crisis but he has no immediate proposals for a reduction in their numbers.  The Government takes the view that Ministers of State are necessary to assist in governing the country in what is a very difficult time.

          <p eId="para_429">As regards the pension levy, tax relief clearly applies at the marginal rate.  It is a pension levy and not a levy on any other type of income.  It applies to all gross income, including the various expenses that Deputy Burton referred to, though in advance of the legislation I will not particularise it in any individual context.  In principle, it applies to all gross income.  As regards the bonuses to which Deputy Burton referred, the Government has decided to abolish these bonuses subject to discussions on the implementation of the decision with the relevant staff association.  I will prepare a detailed paper on this matter in conjunction with the legislation, which is already being drafted in my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">I have two brief questions.  First, the Minister told us yesterday that he would continue to target expenditure and tax measures at those most able to bear the cost.  People on an annual income of €15,000 are subject to this levy, although that sum is below the minimum wage.  How can the Minister consider that category to be most able to bear the cost?</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Second, given that the motion refers to expenditure measures, can the Minister advise us on the Government's policy strategy for job creation or retention?  Does he have a plan or is it secret, too, like the rest of this economic package he claims to have?  If the Minister wants advice on this, I have made several suggestions in the House on job creation and retention.  Will the Minister put any funding into county enterprise boards?  I would appreciate answers to those two matters.  Even additional euro for enterprise and job creation would be appreciated.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">As regards the question on job creation and retention, I did not get an opportunity to reply to Deputy Bruton when he raised that point earlier.  If we want to create jobs in this country the first item we must address is to give ourselves credibility in terms of our public finances.  Of course the Government will make a stream of decisions on job retention and creation, and has been doing so in recent months.  Before Christmas, we saw the prompt action the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food took when the bacon industry was put in jeopardy.  I agree with Deputy Morgan that it is essential to do all in our power to shore up jobs in the real economy in this very difficult period.</p>

Deputy Bruton referred, for example, to the question of export risk insurance, which can be examined.  I must point out, however, that it would be extraordinarily prohibitive for the State to insure against the risk related to currency differentials in the present climate.  However, constructive proposals in that regard will be looked at by the Government and brought forward on that basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I urge the Minister to bring forward a job protection plan.  Some of the money for new job creation could be refocused to protect existing jobs.  Some of the grants and supports that come through the enterprise boards are only for new jobs.  Most people in work want to try to keep their jobs, so some of that finance should be rebalanced and refocused.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">It is not sustainable to have 300,000 plus people on the dole.  The total is heading for 400,000 fast.  Labour initiatives are needed to get some of those people back to work.  It could be cost neutral if some of the people concerned were to be employed in fixing council housing stock and community buildings, doing up bus stations and working in voluntary community groups.  Some of those costs can be offset against capital borrowings.  It would make good economic sense rather than spending €20,000 per person.  It is not right or sustainable so it must be tackled.  With respect, we have been offering solutions since this time last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Many small and medium enterprises are experts in their business fields, but they are not experts in finance, debt management or employment law.  We need a scheme, similar to that in the United Kingdom, which would make professionals available to help such enterprises to compile business plans to avoid the current problems.  They should be able to obtain finance for their businesses from the banks.  There are plenty of retired people on big pensions who could be deployed to guide such enterprises through these difficult times, so the Minister should examine that possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">It is a shame that the foreign aid budget has been cut by €95 million, although I understand why the Minister had to do it.  Some public service sectors are overstaffed due to cutbacks in agriculture and other areas.  Could the Minister offer a voluntary scheme so that some public servants could work in developing countries for three, six, nine or 12 months?  In that case, their wages would be offset against foreign aid, so it would be cost neutral and might bring in savings.  In that way, some departmental employees could be working in the foreign aid sector abroad, including African countries.  That would save us money as well as providing valued experience in agriculture, health and finance to developing countries.  There are many ways in which money could be saved with a bit of imagination.  I can assure the Minister that we have plenty of ideas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_449">In light of the Taoiseach's announcement on Tuesday, I wish to refer to the Financial Regulator's proposal to examine a specific code on mortgages.  Can the Minister provide a clearer picture as to what that entails?  The vast bulk of expenditure by those in the private and public sectors is on mortgages.  When will the Government introduce some scheme to grant relief to mortgage holders who lose their jobs?  While the current rate of home repossessions is quite low, it can be reasonably assumed that the rate will increase seriously in the next few years.  I would like to get some response from the Minister in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Taoiseach's statement also referred to tax credits available to companies and exemptions on capital gains tax.  If the exemptions were significantly increased beyond €40,000 it would give a further incentive for people to come into that sector.  The back-to-education allowance should be amended to allow people who are going to become unemployed to avail of educational training, including how to start up their own companies, without losing their entitlements.  We need to be a bit more imaginative.  If we are going to create tax exemptions based on production in the smart economy, one must create incentives for people to get into that sector in the first instance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_451">I do not think the Minister has fully addressed the questions about the pension levy.  Does the Minister agree it is unfair that people not liable for income tax will get no tax relief when the pension levy is imposed?  Does he agree it is unfair that people within the public sector on lower income levels who will probably get no use of their State contributory old age pension should be required to pay the pension levy?  Will he take another look at the scheme in order to make it fairer?  Looking at it objectively, the scheme appears to be unfair.  Will the Minister give a breakdown of the amount produced by the levy in the various income categories, that is for those on less than €30,000, those between €30,000 and €50,000, those between €50,000 to €70,000, those on from €70,000 to €100,000, and upwards, so that we have some indication of where he is coming from with regard to the levy?</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Minister has spoken about taking €8 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to put into the banks, but there has been no analysis or explanation from him as to the justification for this.  We cannot get funding for the Limerick regeneration project.  Will the Minister consider using money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for that project, which would provide employment and much needed housing in the area?</p>
          <p eId="para_453">This morning, Ryanair announced that 100 jobs were to go in Shannon and up to 700 jobs would be lost indirectly, because of the imposition of the punitive €10 tax on air travel, a tax that only brought in €95 million for this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">There is a large number of questions to deal with.  Deputy English raised a large number of issues relating to the responsibilities of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, I thank him for their constructive character in the context of job protection in the current economic situation.  With regard to financial arrangements, in the announcement made by the Government there has been a refocusing of the capital programme on home insulation and the building of schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">With regard to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, the Deputy made a constructive suggestion which I will take up with the relevant Minister.  I will also take up the constructive suggestion made with regard to the overseas aid budget with the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Deputy Sherlock is concerned about repossessions and mortgages.  I agree with him.  He pointed out that, to date, the rate of repossession has been low.  In the context of the recapitalisation discussions with Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, we have raised the question of limits on repossessions and those institutions have been receptive to our representations.  However, the real difficulty relates to other institutions that do not subscribe to the code of practice on repossessions.  The work of the regulator is targeted at those institutions and at bringing them within a compulsory scheme.  In the absence of full agreement by those institutions to comply with any scheme, I will bring in legislation if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue of the unfairness of the levy.  We have a very fair and progressive tax system here and the pension levy is consistent with that principle.  Working examples relating to actual pay demonstrate that, as a rule, the total deductions as a percentage of gross pay after the pension contribution are greater for those on higher rates of pay rather than lower rates of pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">Surely, if the levy is a pension levy, it can only be levied on pensionable income.  What are the Ministers' views in that regard?  On the recapitalisation of the banks, has the Minister examined the difficulties faced by the banks given that much of their lending is a result of borrowings by the banks?  Therefore any moneys going into recapitalisation may, because the banks must keep borrowing, be used by the banks themselves to pay back what they have borrowed from other banks.  What are the Minister's views on that issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Is the total contribution towards the resolution of the public finances reduced to approximately €900 million rather than the €1.4 billion claimed for the pension levy?  Is the Minister confident that between now and the publication of the Bill he can iron out the many irrational inconsistencies in the scheme?  Does he accept the claim from this side of the House about the unfairness of its application to the lower paid?  Does he acknowledge that some modestly higher-paid civil servants will pay less proportionately towards the pension levy than low-paid civil servants, because of the application of the tax system?</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Is the Minister considering any extra credit facilities, outside of the banking system, for small businesses that are deeply in trouble?  Does the Minister accept, contrary to the public view, that there are 255,000 public servants earning less than €60,000 and that 45,000 are earning more than €60,000 and that the levy is skewed to take disproportionately from the lower paid?</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The issue of industrial civil servants has not been raised.  Industrial civil servants pay full PRSI, contribute towards the old age contributory pension scheme — there is a double disregard for that — arising from which they get a very modest pension.  Will those thousands of industrial civil servants, mostly on low pay, have the pension levy applied to them on their gross income?  Would that not be entirely unfair?</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Various claims have been made about why the social partnership talks broke down.  Is it not a fact that in the framework document the Government committed to all sectors and interests in society making their contribution, but it has produced a pension levy scheme that addresses only one aspect of this?  Issues were raised, such as the difficulties with regard to pensions in the private sector, homes protection, corporate governance, executive pay etc., but as far as the social partners were concerned there was no move on any of these issues but only on the question of the pension levy.  Is that not a very long way from any kind of social solidarity contract?</p>

          <p eId="para_481">Why did the Minister make no reference in his speech to curtailing the interest paid on mortgages to landlords which would have had a yield of more than €500 million?  Why did he not make reference to bespoke pension schemes for directors?</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Why did the Minister make so little reference to liquidity issues?  Taking his point on the Swedish reference, including the wide guarantee restructuring, he did not mention the most important aspect, namely, the quick identification of the state of the assets which was made available to the Swedish public.  It is the biggest stumbling block for the public in terms of what is to happen in the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">On a positive note, the Minister made reference to an bord snip nua.  What about identifying a "bord snap" to examine all of the obstacles placed in the way by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Education and Science?  Delays with regard to availing of any of the back to education or back to work special allowances are longer than 12 months.  It is scandalous that one must wait so long before one qualifies for any of these measures.  Every day, the Minister's letters are written to Deputies stating that even demanding a utility bill of a particular type can delay a person by months.  Self-employed people must wait for the Revenue Commissioners before they can register for social welfare.  The Minister has not commented on any of these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">With regard to the banks, Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred to the Swedish example.  I agree that the identification of the assets which are at risk is crucial to the determination and resolution of their problems.  We have made progress on this through the work of the PricewaterhouseCoopers assessment of the exposures of the banks.  We built on this with auctioneering advice.  In the context of any capitalisation the due diligence exercise will yield further information to enable us to do a far more precise identification of risk before we formulate policy on it.  I would be reluctant to commit the taxpayer on any issue connected with risk without a full and definitive assessment of the risk in the institutions themselves and we must await this assessment.  In general terms I agree with the sequencing outlined by Deputy Higgins that the assessment of risk is vital in finally addressing the problems posed within the banking sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Deputies will note that when the State made the offer to Anglo Irish Bank we followed up with a due diligence and this due diligence influenced me and the Government in arriving at the determination that it should be nationalised.  I do not anticipate, on any of the information I have to hand, that a due diligence will require the nationalisation of the two major banks.  However, it will establish with far greater precision the precise nature of the exposures they have.  This will allow the State to formulate a far more exact policy with regard to risk identification.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">The social partnership process has served Ireland exceptionally well for more than two decades by playing a pivotal role in our economic and social development.  This has been reflected in the ongoing engagement of Government with the social partners in the development of legislative and regulatory frameworks.  In so far as the economy and employment are concerned, a particular focus has been on improving the employability and adaptability of employees, both before and during their working life.  The changes in the Irish labour market arising through increased access by workers from new EU member states are also being addressed and we need to ensure social partnership, which has underpinned the economic and social progress we have achieved, continues to play a positive role in meeting the challenges the economy faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Employment rights legislation has also played an important role in promoting labour market stability and while Towards 2016 recognises the broad level of compliance with employment rights across the economy generally, it, nevertheless, sets out a significant shared commitment by the parties towards securing better compliance with legal requirements underpinned by adequate enforcement.  A fundamental objective of Towards 2016 is to enhance the effectiveness of, and public confidence in, the laws governing employment rights and the Bill delivers on this goal.  Furthermore, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which was established on an interim basis with the priority objective of securing increased public confidence in the system of compliance with employment rights legislation, has been making steady and substantial progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">As the Bill was published with a detailed explanatory and financial memorandum, it is not necessary to explain every section in detail.  Its main provisions include the establishment of NERA on a statutory basis with a tripartite advisory board; the strengthening of the inspection and enforcement powers of NERA together with provisions designed to secure compliance, including the protection of employees against penalisation for claiming their entitlements or "whistleblowing", such as reporting breaches of employment legislation to NERA; specifying the statutory employment records to be kept by employers for all employees and the high penalties for failure to keep these records as well as for other breaches of employment legislation; the fostering of increased co-operation at workplace level so as to safeguard employment rights; provision for exchanges of information between statutory enforcement authorities to facilitate joint investigations where breaches of the law are suspected; strengthening of the powers of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to initiate investigations such as happened in the Gama case and to publish the outcomes in cases of public interest; and the involvement of labour inspectors, for the first time, in the enforcement of provisions of the Employment Permits Acts and the strengthening of those Acts as regards records and other obligations of employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The agreement reached by the social partners to establish NERA on a statutory footing follows the successful establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, in 2001.  The mission of the ODCE is "to improve the compliance environment for corporate activity in the Irish economy".  The Bill is similarly focused on securing a culture of compliance.  At its heart is the intention that all employees, but particularly low paid and other vulnerable groups, can have their rights and entitlements pursued and vindicated by a dedicated State labour inspectorate.  Equally, the Bill is intended to ensure responsible employers, the vast majority of whom proactively give their employees their full entitlements, will not be faced with unfair competition from less scrupulous competitors who are willing to gain competitive advantage by short-changing employees.  The distortion of competition in the market through non-compliance with employment law is an issue that is often overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">I fully appreciate the economic climate has changed dramatically since the inception of this Bill with economy and value for money considerations now to the forefront.  Ireland faces significant economic and fiscal challenges, which were not foreseen at the outset of Towards 2016.  However, arising from the Government's recovery plan, the economy can be strong and dynamic again provided we take the right decisions during this difficult period.  In this regard, it is important to remember that NERA does not make the law but simply enforces it, just as An Garda Síochána enforces the criminal code and Revenue inspectors invigilate tax laws.  I do not expect that the Bill will generate significant costs for employers who comply with employment legislation.  In fact, the Bill's provision for exchange of employment information between statutory enforcement authorities will reduce the need for separate and time-consuming approaches to employers by those authorities.  The Government is also committed, in the smart economy action plan, to a consolidated inspection programme whereby there would be a streamlined approach by the different inspectorates that visit workplaces, including health and safety, social welfare, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Before dealing with the Bill's provisions in more detail, I will update the House on the activities of NERA since operations began in February 2007.  The authority was established on an interim basis following the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and against a backdrop of much disquiet about the inadequacy of enforcement of employment law standards.  Deputies will recall the many parliamentary questions and debates at that time where the Government was condemned for having "more dog wardens than labour inspectors".  That has now changed.  Since its establishment, NERA has been active in organising information and awareness campaigns aimed at employers and employees and designed to bring about a stronger culture of employment compliance.  The information and awareness role played by NERA is important in that this is a necessary precursor to the function of inspection and, ultimately, enforcement to give the necessary time and space for employers to come into compliance.  The organisation has delivered on providing regional cover with offices in Carlow, Dublin, Cork, Sligo and Shannon, which has enabled it to operate throughout the country using the existing powers available under existing employment law compliance legislation.  The authority is well equipped to perform all of the functions and exercise the strengthened powers provided for in the legislation, when enacted.  I am particularly anxious that, upon enactment of the Bill, NERA will become more involved in the enforcement role provided for under employment permits legislation.  I recently wrote to the authority asking it to put in place a focused campaign to ensure that the arrangements prohibiting employment of Bulgarian and Romanian nationals are being adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The legislation will come into operation one month after the President signs it into law.  This dispenses with the need for a commencement order to be made by the Minister.  One month's grace is the minimum needed to allow employers and their advisers to gear themselves up so as not to commit any of the new criminal offences created by the Bill, for example, the new requirements related to keeping employment records or the non-supply of information requested by authorised officers.  However, I am open to the views of Members as to whether this grace period should be extended to allow adequate time to adjust to new arrangements and responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Provisions for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of NERA and a tripartite advisory board are set out in Part 2.  The terms and conditions of appointment of the director are detailed and a limit of ten years is placed on such an appointment.  Provision is also made to guard against any conflict of interests arising in the 12 months following the cessation of the director's appointment and for the resignation, suspension, removal and disqualification of the director.  The director's functions are comprehensively set out, as are provisions for the delegation of functions to the director's staff.  These provisions follow standard practice for such appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Section 28 permits extensive co-operation between NERA and other statutory enforcement authorities so as to enable the director to detect and deal effectively with breaches of employment legislation.  Section 29 enables the director and other statutory enforcement authorities to advise each other of suspected offences under their respective remits which come to their notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The core issue of compliance is addressed at Part 3.  Employers will be required to display notices in or at their workplaces advising employees of their entitlements under employment legislation and how to seek redress for the denial of such entitlements.  Contact information for NERA must also be displayed.  I propose to amend the Bill to require NERA to supply these notices in appropriate languages and to make it clear that the notices may be displayed by electronic or other means, or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">In tandem with NERA's mission to achieve a national culture of employment rights compliance, section 33 of the Bill highlights the first principle of compliance, namely, that employers and employees should, themselves, endeavour to resolve disputes or differences at workplace level where possible.  This principle is key to good workplace relations and good business and is specifically highlighted in Towards 2016 for that reason.  Employees and employers should actively engage in that process in a timely way.  This principle will be developed further in amendments to section 33 which I hope to propose on Committee Stage, along with refinements to existing employment legislation which I will be making by way of additions to Schedule 5 to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Section 33 also obliges the director of NERA to provide authoritative information on request to employees or employers to enable them, as far as possible, to resolve their disputes or differences at the workplace.  In order to be able to do this, and also in the general context of effectively promoting compliance with employment legislation, the director of NERA will need to keep up to date with decisions of rights commissioners and determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court, as well as with rulings of the Irish courts and the European Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The key area of enforcement is addressed at Part 4 of the Bill.  It specifically empowers the director of NERA to formally appoint authorised officers, and offences are created where anyone obstructs, impedes, assaults or impersonates an authorised officer.  Provision is made for right of entry, inspection, examination and investigation by authorised officers who may seek a court order for the production of evidential material if necessary.  I expect, and I am assured through ongoing contacts with the director of NERA, that these powers will be used judiciously and appropriately at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Section 38 empowers the director to require specific persons to give information or produce documents and section 39 makes it an offence for any person to falsify, conceal, destroy or dispose of any relevant record so as to thwart an investigation by the director of a suspected offence.  Section 41 provides a necessary power for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the public interest, to require the director to undertake an investigation of a particular employment or particular classes of employment in which the Minister reasonably believes there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Section 47 of the Bill is designed to secure prompt payment of moneys owing to employees under employment legislation.  It empowers the director of NERA or an authorised officer to issue a compliance notice requiring an employer to pay any moneys believed to be owing to any employee under employment legislation.  The employer concerned is entitled to challenge such a compliance notice directly or to appeal against the director's decision to the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Section 49 provides for enforcement orders which may be needed to deal with urgent and significant cases of non-compliance with employment legislation.  It empowers the director to apply to the High Court for an order requiring the employer concerned to comply with the relevant provision.  Again, this is a function which NERA will use judiciously and only when absolutely necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Part 5 of the Bill strengthens both the obligations of employers and the rights of employees.  In particular, section 50 provides immunity for any persons who in good faith report breaches of employment legislation to NERA, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or to the Garda Síochána.  As a corollary, it will be a serious offence for anyone to report in bad faith.  Section 51, with Schedule 2, provides comprehensive protection for employees against penalisation by their employers for reporting breaches of employment legislation in good faith, whether by their employer or by another employer, or for seeking their entitlements or exercising rights, or for giving evidence in court proceedings relating to such breaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Section 52 makes comprehensive provision for statutory employment records to be kept and maintained by employers.  Where there is failure to keep such records, the onus will be on the employer or other person concerned to prove in court proceedings that the relevant provision of employment legislation was complied with as regards the employees concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Despite our best efforts at promoting compliance with the law, there may still be some temptation for non-compliance.  As a deterrent, the Bill provides considerable penalties both for new offences and existing ones, in line with Towards 2016.  For the most serious of the new offences, the maximum penalty on summary conviction will amount to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  On conviction on indictment, a maximum fine of €250,000 is available and-or three years' imprisonment.  These are maximum penalties.  It will be for the courts to decide on the penalty to impose on conviction in any specific case.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">As Deputies will have noticed, Schedule 5 to the Bill does not yet provide for consequential and other amendments required to more than 30 separate enactments which come within the definition of "employment legislation".  Those amendments, together with further refinements needed to the Employment Permits Acts, will be included in the full set of amendments to the Bill which I hope to table for consideration on Committee Stage.  I know I will get considerable co-operation from the committee and its chairman, who is present today.  Those amendments will include substantial changes to the body of the Bill, to reflect the outcome of detailed consultations with the social partners and stakeholders, and further detailed examination of the Bill with the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The amendments will include removing some offences from the category of "criminal offences" and deletion of section 61, fixed-payment notices, so as to make enforcement more proportionate on employers; strengthening the role of the tripartite advisory board, by requiring the director of NERA to have regard to advice provided by the advisory board on any issue and, in particular on NERA's work programme and strategy statement; clarifying the workplace notice requirements of employers by requiring them to display notices according to templates provided by NERA; highlighting the need for employees and employers to endeavour to resolve promptly disputes or differences at workplace level, but without prejudice to employees' statutory entitlements or any NERA investigations or other enforcement activity which may be needed; clarifying that persons appearing before the director of NERA can also be accompanied by a trade union representative or an employer's organisation representative, as appropriate, as well as by a legal representative; making clear provision that certain key employment records will be readily available in the State for NERA to examine if necessary; reducing the burden on employers on cessation of employees' employment by limiting their obligation to produce a statement of employment on a request basis only; prohibiting the retention by employers of personal documents or other property of employees; and amending Schedule 5 of the Bill so as to require employers to keep a copy of any employment permit granted to any of their employees, rather than a copy of every employee's passport or other identity document, which would be unnecessarily burdensome.  As I understand it, it is already an offence under other legislation to retain anyone's passport unlawfully.  The opportunity will also be taken to clarify provisions of the Employment Permits Acts to assist their operation and enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The Bill does not change current statutory arrangements relating to the roles of the various employment rights adjudication bodies —  rights commissioners, the Labour Relations Commission, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court — which have a key role in ensuring that disputes concerning employees' rights are resolved as efficiently and as effectively as possible.  While there may be a case for improving and streamlining these bodies, it would be my intention to develop any proposals in this regard separately and in the light of ongoing Government deliberations on agency rationalisation and efficiency reviews.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The Bill does not amend employment law which currently exists in the context of the minimum wage, holiday entitlements, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  Employers are obliged to comply with existing laws and the issue of NERA inspections does not impose any additional regulatory burden.  This is an important point.  The industrial relations framework that has evolved since the foundation of the State is essentially voluntaristic in nature.  Many of the mechanisms for regulating industrial relations are tripartite in nature, including the Labour Court and other employment rights bodies.  This approach has been strengthened in recent years by the development of strong social partnership structures.  In practical terms, this means that the State has been prepared to leave the regulation of many issues to employers and workers, including minimum wages and terms and conditions in certain sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">An example of this approach is the process by which minimum rates of pay are agreed through joint labour committees and made through registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders, for example in the hotel and catering sectors.  In these cases, neither the Minister of State nor NERA as the enforcement agency has any role in the setting of the wage rates and other terms.  This can only be done by employers and workers themselves and this arrangement has existed since the late 1940s.  It is a good arrangement which supports the voluntarist system of industrial relations and does not unnecessarily involve the State in regulating areas of the economy where agreement can be reached by workers and employers alike.  As with all powers come accompanying responsibilities.  In these challenging times, it is more important than ever that both employers and workers who participate on joint labour committees are responsive to prevailing circumstances and to the impact that appropriate terms and conditions can have on the ongoing viability of businesses and the protection of employment levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Some recent encouraging signals include a preliminary agreement between the employer and trade union interests in the catering sector to fix a uniform set of terms and conditions, including minimum pay rates and Sunday premium rates, for application throughout the country.  An aversion to responding to changing circumstances is in no one's interest.  Social partnership has always proved itself adaptable in the past and, notwithstanding current difficulties at national level, I am confident that it can continue to renew itself and respond to the emerging challenges that face us all as an economy and a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">In conclusion, this Bill is to provide for employment rights, to protect workers and to ensure they receive their statutory entitlements.  I will be happy to expand on any of the foregoing and answer any questions Deputies may have and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_388">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_863">The Towards 2016 agreement was made more than two years ago and circumstances have changed fundamentally and considerably since then.  We are now in the midst of an economic crisis and the social partnership system has not held up in the way others may have expected or hoped, given the decisions made this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Bill was published last March but it is an indication of how flawed it is that it took so long to come before the House.  The Minister of State has outlined some amendments which are planned for the most flawed parts of the Bill and I look forward to seeing their details.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">As this Bill arose from the Towards 2016 agreement, it is worth noting the most recent statement from IBEC, one of the social partners, that in its view the Bill as drafted goes way beyond what was agreed at the Towards 2016 stage: "We must oppose any measure that makes it more difficult to get a job and keep a job, including any attempts to make the labour market more flexible."  It refers in particular to the 23 new criminal offences established in this Bill and also the new powers conferred on NERA.  It may be the case that IBEC will be satisfied by the Minister of State's amendments but it may not.  I am not sure if Chambers Ireland is a social partner but it represents chambers of commerce all over the country and in my view is therefore a national economic partner.  I do not know whether it is a Fianna Fáil social partner but it has issued a statement today condemning and criticising the Bill and saying that its members consider it to be an additional layer of bureaucracy.  It has made its opposition clear.  The representative body of small and medium-sized enterprises, ISME, is not a social partner of Fianna Fáil's but in my view it is an important social and economic partner representing tens of thousands of businesses across the country.  It is strongly opposed to this Bill which it considers to be an attempt to criminalise employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">I note that 320,000 people are on the live register and 450,000 people will be on the register before the end of the year.  We need to be very careful about the type of employment legislation we adopt in order to ensure that by attempting to protect employees we do not end up putting their jobs at risk as an unintended consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The Bill gives statutory footing to NERA.  I do not have a problem with a statutory footing for the body but as the Ministers have said on a number of occasions, it is unnecessary.  However, I have a problem with the concept of setting up an agency to solve every problem and I will return to that point later.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I refer to the further bureaucratisation of the employment law system and the proliferation of quangos and State agencies.  This Bill will establish another board on a statutory footing and create a multiplicity of organisations dealing with labour rights with up to six different organisations in existence which will lead to confusion and cause problems both for employers and employees.  I am concerned at the near-extraordinary powers the Bill gives and in many cases it changes the relationship between employers and employees from one that is largely voluntarist and co-operative to one which involves the criminalisation of employers.  I will deal with this point in more detail later in my contribution.  It gives extraordinary powers to NERA which are like those of the Garda Síochána or of the powers which are abused by the Competition Authority.  My party will not stand over giving a State agency those kind of powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The Bill will have the greatest impact on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Large business, the banks and semi-State companies are represented by IBEC — it does not really represent small business.  Big business and large companies have human relations and legal departments to deal with aspects of the Bill but such legislation will be a heavy burden on small business.  The Small Firms Association is the division of IBEC representing small firms and it has expressed its concerns about the Bill.  I refer to a statement by Pat Crotty, former chairperson, to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He stated that in its current format the Bill has the potential to cease all employment creation in small businesses.  He said he was not exaggerating in commenting that from the perspective of the owners and managers of small businesses there is a risk in being subject to 20 new criminal offences just to employ someone and to grow the business.  If this is the view among employers and even among those involved in Fianna Fáil social partnership, I cannot understand how this Bill can be anything other than one-sided.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I note the Minister of State has indicated that significant amendments will be tabled but the Bill as published will be opposed by Fine Gael and if it is passed in its current form Fine Gael will repeal it when in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">To address the point regarding the establishment of NERA as a separate agency, I do not believe this was necessary.  In many ways this was as a result of the Gama scandal but the failure in Gama was not that we did not have a quango but rather that we did not have enough labour inspectors in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and they were not doing their job properly.  The number of labour inspectors has been significantly increased and there are now 80 inspectors, which is to be welcomed.  It was not necessary to set up a new State agency at considerable expense and to decentralise it to Carlow or any part of the country just to increase the number of inspectors as this could have been done in any case.  Had there been enough labour inspectors and had they and the Department been doing their job properly, it would not have been necessary to set up an agency.  In many ways the establishment of NERA was the typical Government response to every problem which is to set up another agency with its own headquarters, its own directors and board and its own website and this is the wrong approach.  It is the Government's approach to every problem but has largely failed over the past number of years.  I also have a difficulty with the title of the agency, NERA, National Employment Rights Authority.  This is an organisation that is supposed to represent a consensus and to promote a culture of compliance but it does not sound like that to me.  This is not like the Health and Safety Authority.  The title of the National Employment Rights Authority implies that this is a body set up to be one-sided.  It will be like a policeman receiving complaints from the victims, the employees, who will then raid the premises and prosecute the employers.  The name alone reflects an attitude within the organisation and among those who have drafted the Bill.  A more appropriate name would be the labour law authority or something like that rather than the National Employment Rights Authority, which sends all the wrong messages.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I am also concerned about the duplication of roles and further layers of State agencies and bureaucracies being created.  In his contribution the Minister of State said that efficiency reviews are ongoing and that the Government is examining this entire area.  This Bill was created in the minds of people two years ago.  It was published last March.  The Minister is obviously not in a hurry to do it because it is two years since it was thought up and almost a year since it was published.  The Minister of State has made the case many times that the National Employment Rights Authority can operate without being put on a statutory footing and therefore I do not understand the reason to put forward this flawed Bill now.  If the Government is doing efficiency reviews and examining the consolidation of State agencies, why does it not do that first instead of bringing in a Bill we may have to repeal or considerably amend when it completes that review of State agencies and efficiencies?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_389" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_873">That is the parliamentary process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_874">Perhaps the Government is not sincere about doing that.  It may be the case that it does not plan to do an efficiency review.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Citizens information centres advise people to whom they should go when they have complaints.  They go to NERA when it comes to employment regulation orders, minimum wage, pay slips, protection of young workers and employment permits.  They go to the rights commissioner if the issue concerns other minimum wage issues, unfair dismissal, working times, failure to give written terms and conditions, fixed-term work, part-time work and so on.  They go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal on different items such as rights having been breached with regard to redundancy, unfair dismissal and minimum notice.  They go to the Labour Court on other matters.  On employment equality matters they go to the Equality Tribunal.  On some issues they go to the Health and Safety Authority and on others they go to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The Government has an opportunity now to get this right rather than simply set up a new agency, review its efficiency, effectiveness and necessity after a period and then redefine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">One of the major changes in the Bill is the difference between the rights commissioner system and NERA.  If I do not get my holiday pay or my holidays, for example, the current process is that I go to the rights commissioner.  The rights commissioner investigates it and sorts out the problem.  The rights commissioner system works very well and the Labour Relations Commission, of which it is a part, works very well.  That can now change.  Instead of going to the rights commissioner I can now go to NERA and instead of NERA sorting out the problem in the way the rights commissioner can do, NERA can then prosecute the employer.  Instead of trying to sort out the problem in the way it was always done in the past, the Minister will make a dispute that could have been sorted out in the normal way, and always has been sorted out, a criminal matter for which the employer could be prosecuted, bear the cost of the prosecution and potentially be fined or even imprisoned.  That is not the right approach.  I realise I will be accused of right wing tendencies for saying that but the logic of the argument is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">Regarding the position of the director, we should cap the remuneration of the director in the Bill.  We should make it clear in the Bill that no bonuses will be paid to the director.  The fact that the director of the National Consumer Agency got a €25,000 bonus today is appalling and is an indictment on the Government.  It indicates where it stands on public sector pay, which is to give bonuses to those who are already overpaid and to punish those who earn under €15,000.  That is a disgrace.  We must set clear provisions in this Bill that bonuses will not be paid or if they are, that there are clear criteria as to the purpose of those bonuses.  Rising prices and people crossing the Border to go shopping should not be the reason for getting a bonus.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I have concerns about the advisory board.  NERA is already operating; it does not need an advisory board.  This appears to be an attempt to create another FÁS type board.  It will have three representatives from IBEC, three from ICTU, and three from Fianna Fáil or people known to Fianna Fáil, all of whom will get remuneration.  They will be down in Mount Juliet eating <i> foie gras</i>.  If they are as shameful as some of the IBEC and ICTU people who have served on FÁS they will fly first class to Florida in contravention of Government guidelines and then refuse to repay that money.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The last thing the country needs is for the Minister of State to create another FÁS board.  If we are to have a board it is important that we require that the people appointed to that board are vetted by an Oireachtas committee and that the three independent representatives, and their qualifications, are clearly defined.  That is the type of role that should go to, say, a legal expert in employment law and not necessarily to a political appointee.  We should also ensure there is no remuneration for the board members and that they do not engage in the type of practices that have become typical of State boards established under this Fianna Fáil partnership structure, which I believe people have lost faith in given what they have seen in FÁS and other boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">On the new powers being given to NERA, I am happy enough with some aspects of the Bill.  The joint investigation unit is a good idea and I support the protection for whistleblowers.  I have problems with the provision for the new criminal offences of which there are 23 according to the count of IBEC and the Small Firms Association.  I counted 15 but that can be clarified later.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">I am against one of the provisions in section 36 and I will not support the Bill if it goes forward.  It concerns the power to raid businesses, secure them as if they were a crime scene, and take away any documents NERA wants without any allegation being made, any suspicion or any court order.  It is similar to what the Competition Authority has done where it has abused its powers.  It can go into a small business and declare it a crime scene, take all the books away, prosecute the people involved and send them to jail.  That provision must go.  I do not mind the idea of a business being raided or documents removed but there must be a <i>prima facie</i> basis for doing so.  There must be an allegation or a suspicion.  We cannot treat businesses in this way.  There is no way this party, or any party that purports to be in favour of small businesses, could support such a provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Section 32(6)(<i>b</i>) denies the right of silence to an employer.  Essentially, if an employer does not respond to a question, that can be inferred by the director as an admission of guilt.  We do not take away those kind of rights from murderers yet we intend to take them away from an employer.  That is unacceptable and I reject a Bill that includes such a provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Section 59 includes fines of up to €5,000 and terms of imprisonment of up to three years for potentially minor offences.  What would happen in the current labour law context is that an inspection will be carried out, the employer will be told they must rectify the position and, if they do not, a prosecution may follow.  This provision could allow a prosecution to occur without any opportunity for the person to rectify the position.  For example, the inspectors could seize documents without giving the employer an opportunity to put the documents together.  Essentially they become evidence, and that must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">As I mentioned in my statement today, I have a serious problem with section 61, which deals with the fixed payment notices.  Again, it involves the inspector going in and behaving like a garda or a clamper by accusing an employer and imposing fines Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  The employer ends up being fined several thousand euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The approach we should take when it comes to employment law is to give employers an opportunity to comply.  For example, if the employer does not have the required notice displayed or if it is not in the correct language, they should be given an opportunity to comply.  We should not simply fine them on the spot as if this was a litter offence.  That is not the right approach to these issues.  I note the Minister proposes to table an amendment to that section, and I look forward to the detail of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The fine for not keeping records is €250,000.  That is extraordinary.  If someone violates a tree protection order the fine is €65.  If, like Kimpton Vale Limited or Larry Keegan, one knocks down a convent in south Dublin the fine is €1,000 but the maximum fine for not keeping records is €250,000.  We must have some proportion in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Section 51 deals with the penalisation of workers.  Depending on who one believes, the legal advice we have from the people who essentially wrote the book on employment law is that under this system an employer would not be able to transfer an employee from full-time to part-time work as that could be considered penalisation.  The obligation would then be on the employer to prove that was not penalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">In the context of the current economy where people are moving from full-time to part-time work or working a shorter week because there is not enough work to be done, we should not create a new legal obligation on employers to prove that they have to do that.  That is not something that is appropriate to employment legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The Minister of State said there may be an amendment to the section relating to statements of service which I would welcome.  As drafted, the Bill would make it a criminal offence if an employer did not give a statement of service to a departing employee, even if he or she did not ask for it.  This is an insane provision.  It is one matter if an employee asks for a statement of service, another if he or she does not.  Statements of service should become a standard feature of people departing employment but should include information, such as attendance and punctuality, which would be of interest to future employers in assessing an employee's work record.  I will be introducing amendments on Committee Stage in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I have a difficulty with the provision of multilingual notices.  The official languages of the State are Irish and English.  Putting the onus on employers to decide in which languages they have to post notices could lead to difficulties.  For example, in an Indian restaurant there may be employees from India or Pakistan who speak six different languages.  Will it be incumbent on the employer to publish notices in all six different languages?  Is he supposed to know the notice is meant to be in Tagalog and not Telugu, Malayalam instead of Hindi?  This provision could create an unfair burden on employers when the official languages of the State are Irish and English.  It would be better if NERA could assist employers in this regard.  It has already done some good work in producing information on labour rights in six different languages.  To impose a criminal sanction on an employer if notices are not produced in the correct languages is both onerous and unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">I am glad the Minister of State intends to remove the provision about retaining a copy of an employee's passport.  I would love to meet the muppet who wrote this Bill.  I cannot understand why this provision was included.  Why would an employer want a copy of an employee's passport and retain it for three years?  I appreciate this will be amended.  Section 54 relates to the return of private property to employees.  That is contained in existing legislation and I do not understand why it needs to be included in employment legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">To the best of my knowledge no proper regulatory impact assessment has been carried out on this legislation.  Those done by the Government are poor and do not contain any figures on costs.  I have been informed the reason a full assessment has not been carried out is because the Government believes there will be no costs for business.  That is rubbish.  This legislation, when enacted, will have a significant cost impact on business.  A regulatory assessment must be carried out.  It is not good enough for the Government to say it has decided there are no costs.  I cannot support this Bill unless a regulatory impact assessment is carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">An article I read suggested the role of the trade unions could be undermined by this Bill.  Due to the relationship of the employee and employer becoming more one of a victim and a criminal, the employee will go to NERA to enforce his or her rights instead of going through the normal process of industrial relations with a union representative.  One section creates the primacy of the latter approach.  However, the rest of the Bill does the opposite.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">It is not but it is a relevant point.  I do not have an objection to people being members of trade unions.  I was a member of one in the past.  Where disputes arise and unions are recognised by the employer, resolution through it is a logical course to follow.  In many ways, NERA will supersede that.  Employees will go straight to NERA to have the employment policeman sort out their criminal complaint against an employer instead of resolving it through the normal industrial relations processes in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Dr. Tony Dobbins, in an article on compliance in employment law, states there are two approaches, the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin.  This Bill, he argues, adopts an Anglo-Saxon model where six separate agencies behave like policemen in enforcing the law in businesses.  The Latin model, on the other hand, which is used in most of Europe, is more holistic, giving most functions to the one authority and a real degree of discretion to the labour inspectors to work with employers and employees to deliver a desired outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I accept NERA is just doing its job in enforcing the employment regulation orders in the catering and hotel sector.  It has been established as a policeman to prosecute employers who are criminals and deal with them in the way it has.  I believe that is not the right approach.  NERA should be able to have a more holistic approach in dealing with labour inspections and to show some degree of discretion and leniency where appropriate.  I regret the Government has not opted for that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I have no objection to the joint investigations units.  The IBEC submission on the legislation stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">The Bill is supposed to recognise the central obligation on employers and employees to attempt to resolve workplace disputes.  This is to be welcomed and enforcement is always to be a last resort.  However, the Bill does not effectively enshrine that obligation in statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The Minister of State did not refer to any amendments that would ensure enforcement is a last resort and not the first action to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The director of NERA will have the power to issue compliance notices without having to go to a court which allows him to decide what is the law.  Essentially, the policeman is being given the powers of the court.  I accept that is how the planning system worked but I am not sure that is appropriate to employment law.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">At a recent conference, Tom Mallon, a barrister who specialises in employment law, pointed out that a situation could arise from this legislation that if an employer dismissed an employee because the employee refused to transfer from full-time work to part-time work, then the employer would be guilty of a criminal offence.  Can the Minister imagine how many employers are now criminals because of such requests with the recent economic downturn?</p>
          <p eId="para_903">This is a flawed Bill.  NERA, as an agency, did not have to be established separately to the labour inspectorate.  It is a typical Government response to establish an agency for every problem that emerges.  The labour inspectorate could have easily been properly resourced.  This legislation will create new layers of bureaucracy and duplication with a new board similar to that of FÁS being established.  It also gives extraordinary powers to NERA to raid businesses, take away documents and criminalise and prosecute employers.  The fourth issue is the absence of a proper impact analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">This Bill is disproportionate and heavy-handed.  It will fundamentally change the relationship between employees and employers and will potentially criminalise people just for taking staff on and giving them a job.  We do not need this in the current economic context.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_905">On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the fact that the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 has eventually reached the floor of the Dáil, as it had a considerable length of time in gestation.  We now have an opportunity to allow for a comprehensive debate on these important issues.  The Bill is being introduced in different circumstances from that in which it was negotiated with the trade union movement and social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The Bill is designed to give effect to commitments set out in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and considerably strengthen the law and enforcement effort to ensure employee statutory entitlements and protections would apply and are honoured.  Deputy Varadkar has indicated he is opposed some aspects of the Bill and some of it clearly needs amendment.  I interpreted some of Deputy Varadkar's views as being opposed to the concept of rights.  One cannot blind oneself to the fact that even gathering information can be very problematic in the context of employers.  I have experience of trying to get a P45 from an employer for an employee.  This is a statutory document without which rights to jobseeker's or other benefits cannot be determined.  Nevertheless, employers can sit on their hands and not furnish such documents.  That is a simple matter but it involves a statutory document to which the employee is duly entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">We cannot blind ourselves to these realities.  I am against the strangulation of small business through bureaucracy and I support efforts against this — I am on the record of the Dáil in this respect — but I cannot in conscience allow an unscrupulous employer to do what they wish with an employee.  It is like the old master-servant relationship, where there is no control on how far a person can be pushed.  In that situation there would have been no regulation determining the time worked and people would hardly have time for lunch break before being called into service.  They would be kept working until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. without any regard to overtime.  These rights were hard fought for by union members and some of our forefathers.  I want to see them protected rather than lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">For the employer who adheres to regulations there is nothing to fear.  The Minister of State present is responsible for labour and he is quite capable.  I do not say this condescendingly.  Setting up NERA as a separate body must be re-examined.  The old Department of Labour has enough expertise within it to deal with those issues, receive complaints and pursue them and ensure rights are enforced.  These are rights that people are entitled to and obligations should be fulfilled in that regard.  We do not need another quango to achieve that, which will have a structure of chief executive, deputy chief executive, a plethora of advisers, advisory boards, etc.  This is where I have a problem as in the current climate we must cut down on these.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">The Deputy has been accommodated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_912">That is fair enough.  I am sure there will be more accommodation when we get down to business.  One of the big problems was the lack of inspectors.  There were only 30 or 35.  Like the acorn seed becoming an oak, it took a long time to increase the number of inspectors to 90.  We now have an inspectorate but it should be under the umbrella of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">This is the second in a suite of employment rights and compliance measures which were negotiated during the partnership agreements.  When enacted the Bill will modernise the labour inspectorate and establish a national employment rights authority, NERA, which has a long-winded name.  It will strengthen the inspection and enforcement powers of NERA, which will include the power to issue compliance notices and the ability to prosecute summary offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The Bill strengthens the obligations of employers with regard to statutory record keeping and introduces whistleblower protection for employees who report breaches of employment law.  There is also protection from penalty when claiming employment rights.  It increases the penalties for breach of employment law up to €5,000 and-or 12 months in prison for summary offences, or up to €250,000 and-or three years in prison for indictable offences, along with the use of name and shame provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">This could be done without setting up another structure.  One other problem is that we have too many structures.  We have very fine labour dispute resolution mechanisms, including the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Equality Authority.  That has been subsumed and is now gone.  There is also the Labour Court in Tom Johnson House.  We have fine structures in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">NERA has already had an impact and the report of proceedings during 2008 will be available next week at a briefing by the Minister of State.  It is noticeable from perusal of the Bill that there is a failure to set out a role for trade unions within the compliance framework.  It does not provide for the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding between NERA — assuming the Government goes ahead with it and ignores our advice to keep it as part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The concept is very important and I should underline our support for this.  It is to ensure people's rights are protected and underpinned, although we believe it could be done within that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Bill does not provide for this memorandum of understanding between NERA — or whatever concept we have — and unions such as ICTU.  The employment regulation order referred to is one area where we can see this working, particularly with difficulties bedevilling the hotel and restaurant industry.  People who wanted to can have a JLC.  They came into place in the 1940s, when it was important to have them, particularly in the agricultural area.  They were very important  but now we have partnership agreements, wage agreements and a plethora of employment law.  In that context it is important to note employer and trade union interests are working together in the catering sector to deal with a set of uniform terms and conditions.  There was one for Dublin and one for outside the Dublin area.  They dealt with minimum pay rates, which is very important, and the Sunday pay rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">This led to division and the trade has almost collapsed, from what I hear on the ground.  It is important that unions understand the position and that is the reason it is important to include such considerations in the legislation.  The Minister of State will move to accommodate this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I have also noted an employment regulation order relevant to the security industry.  It came into effect on 1 January 2009 and allows increases of approximately 10% to 13%.  The association involved is part of the security industry's joint labour committee that agreed the package in 2006.  In light of the current economic turmoil, however, things have changed.  There will be little receptivity among customers in respect of being asked to pay up and cover the costs.  Many customers, including State and semi-State organisation, gave a commitment in respect of this matter but then flatly refused to allow the fees to be passed on to them.  The HSE was one of the customers mentioned in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">If State and semi-State bodies must, in conjunction with the unions, given consideration to this matter.  NERA will be involved and will be carrying out inspections of companies.  It will be subjected to a blank response from customers.  When the package was negotiated in 2006, the economy was in a different state.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">It is important the rights of workers be respected.  However, I am concerned there is an insistence that the provisions in the package be honoured.  It will further exacerbate the position with regard to unemployment in an industry which is now regulated and within which proper structures are in place.  There should be a consultation process and a memorandum of understanding should be in place to allow matters of this nature to be thrashed out.  No one can be indifferent to the conditions in which people are obliged to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">In the Labour Party's view, it is important the solutions to issues that arise be provided in the first instance at the level of the workplace.  However, this does not appear to be affecting the agreement and I note the Minister of State is to correct the position.  I am of the opinion that employers and employees would be very eager to see a provision in this regard being included.  If the Bill is not amended in respect of this matter, then NERA will be obliged to operate in a vacuum.  The question of how NERA will interact with unions, employers and those in the workplace must be addressed.  I believe the Minister of State has accepted that if the position is not changed, the results could be disastrous.  If the Bill, as it stands, is enacted, will NERA be obliged to have due regard to the agreed disciplinary procedures to which employers and employees already subscribe?</p>
          <p eId="para_923">A core principle of Towards 2016 is that initiation and ownership of cases will rest with the complainant in so far as is possible.  This is important because it will allow complainants to consult their union and ascertain their statutory and contractual rights.  It will also allow for workplace solutions to be achieved.  Trade unions and employers or their representatives have extremely important roles to play in this regard.  As the Bill is currently drafted, employees will have no role whatever in decisions affecting them which are taken by NERA.  There is a lacuna in the legislation in this regard which must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">A commitment was given in Towards 2016 to the effect that every employee must have an identifiable employer in the State who is legally responsible for compliance with all aspects of the applicable employment rights legislation.  Section 46 of the Bill allows for co-operation with other member states but it does not require that statutory records must be kept in this State.  As a result, a sizeable number of employees will remain outside the protection of the legislation.  ICTU has made the point that such an approach would be inconsistent with the posting of Workers Directive 96/71/EC, which places a duty on member states to guarantee to all EU workers posted in their territories the same protection under labour law as applies to local workers.  In the absence of such a provision, a question arises as to how such a posted worker might recover moneys owed to him or her.  Perhaps the Bill can be amended in order to ensure records identifying legally responsible employers are kept.  If the Government does not move an amendment in respect of this matter on Committee Stage, my party will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Section 47 of the Bill confers on inspectors the power to impose penalties when they issue compliance notices.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins has been very much to the fore in respect of this matter.  He inquired on the Order of Business last week as to when the Bill would be introduced because he is particularly concerned with regard to migrant workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The definition of an "employee" appears to be restrictive.  The body might find itself restricted from investigating and enforcing employment rights and some workers might well be effectively excluded from existing rights because they will be unable or will find it difficult to have themselves included under this definition.  In the Industrial Relations Act 1946, the term used is "worker".  Under that legislation, a worker is "any person of the age of fourteen years or upwards who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer whether the contract be for manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise, be expressed or implied, oral or in writing, and whether it be a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour".  That is a far more wide-ranging definition.</p>

        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_928">Exactly.  The Labour Party brought forward legislation to try to bring Ireland into compliance with the temporary agency workers directive.  I accept that matters in respect of this may be ongoing.  However, I must draw attention to the absence of any provision in the definition of "employer" in the context of who NERA will treat as the employer of an agency worker.  My party wants the Bill to be amended in this regard in order that sufficient cover will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The definition relating to employment legislation means that only the legislation listed in Schedule 1 of the Bill will apply.  However, certain items of legislation are missing from that Schedule.  In that context, the Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 to 2005, the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 to 2004 and the Parental Leave Acts 1998 to 2006 must be included.  The Minister of State might say that a plethora of Acts is included and ask why we should insert more.  If a worker returns from sick leave but is refused annual leave, NERA can examine complaints relating to annual leave because provision is made in respect of rights thereto under the Organisation of Working Time Act.  However, it is not in a position to consider people's rights that arise under the maternity legislation.  By leaving the legislation to which I refer out of the Schedule, the potential for the creation of unnecessary difficulties or loopholes will be created.  People would also enjoy less protection than exists under the other employment rights legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Consideration should also be given to including the relevant section of the Data Protection Acts 1999 to 2003, at the very least for investigation purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Section 6 states: "The objective of the National Employment Rights Authority shall be to promote, encourage and secure compliance with employment legislation."  As I indicated, I would prefer if this function was performed by the labour section of the Department.  Given the importance of encouraging compliance with employment rights, the promotion of rights must be given a prime position in legislation.  In fairness, the Minister of State noted that considerable public awareness work has been done through television and radio advertisements and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">While I accept the need to avoid strangling companies with bureaucracy, maintaining employment records of staff is not an earth-shattering requirement.  Incidentally, I support the inclusion of ISME in the partnership process.  Given that one cannot abrogate statutory employment rights, how would it be possible to kick them to touch?  Nevertheless, I accept the necessity to provide employers with a single, uniform and simplified form.  Mr. Mark Fielding of ISME and Ms Patricia Callan of the Small Firms Association stated before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment that companies receive a plethora of forms, all of which seek similar information.  This excessive bureaucracy is smothering small companies.  Mr. Fielding and Ms Callan called for a single form to be introduced, which could be filled in on-line.  The information provided could then be accessed by agencies such as the Central Statistics Office, Revenue Commissioners and NERA and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">We cannot abrogate workers' rights because they do not suit employers.  I say this as one whose wife must maintain employee records and documentation such as P35 forms.  The National Employment Rights Authority may secure compliance through a number of means.  I hope the first port of call will be encouragement and awareness and NERA will not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  However, in the case of recalcitrant employers, the director of NERA may initiate prosecutions of offences by way of summary proceedings or refer cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions where the director has reasonable grounds for believing that an indictable offence under employment legislation has been committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The application of dissuasive sanctions is crucial in this area, as it is in all other areas of law.  It is no use burying our heads in the sand or denying that we have unscrupulous employers.  I have stood on picket lines with workers employed by such companies.  In doing so, I was following in the footsteps of my forefathers and I would do so again.  My party goes back as far as 1913 and we have not forgotten that rights are trampled on.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">I would be inclined to limit the role of advisory boards, whereas trade unions may wish to have the role of these boards strengthened.  Why is advice needed when the law is available?</p>

          <p eId="para_937">It is not necessary to establish a large quango.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">We should not pass legislation and lay it off to someone else.  When Deputies ask a question about the National Roads Authority, not to speak of the Health Service Executive, we cannot obtain answers.  I discovered recently that all medical card applications made by people aged over 70 years will be processed in Finglas.  Deputies will be shocked to learn that virtually no medical cards for people aged 70 years and over are being processed.  This is being done under our noses but I have a way of ferreting out information.  I may not seek it but it comes to me.  This type of practice is taking place but no one will answer a question about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The reply I received to a question to the Minister for Health and Children the other day reminded me of Pudsy Ryan.  It repeated the information I provided in the question.  This practice is a denial of democracy.  When I am alerted to a fact, I am entitled to obtain information on it.  I do not want to deal with an advisory board or other body.  The Oireachtas enacts primary legislation.  Irrespective of our views, Deputies Higgins, Barrett, Varadkar and I are democratically elected and our role is to seek to amend the legislation.  If our amendments our defeated on Committee Stage by a majority vote, that is democracy.  The Minister will be held accountable for the actions of NERA.  I do not want responsibility to devolved to another body from which I will be unable to obtain information.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Under section 27, named official agencies may share certain information.  The list of such agencies, as set out in section 27(4), should be amended to include the Equality Authority, Labour Court and Data Protection Commissioner.  The Labour Party is concerned that this section may give rise to some unintended consequences.  In particular, my party is concerned about the sharing of information on trade union membership, even among official agencies.  For example, one such agency, the Competition Authority interfered inappropriately, as Deputy Varadkar noted, in workers' freedoms of association and the rights of trade unions to organise their own affairs.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins proposed amending legislation to change the current statutory position in this regard but his worthwhile Bill was shot down by the Government.  The Competition Authority believes itself to be omnipotent and wishes to be the surveyors of all things.  It has also made some interesting proposals to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment which I chair.  It has, however, interfered in the right of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, Equity, which represents actors, and the musicians union to organise their own affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">An amendment will be required to protect against inappropriate disclosure of trade union membership.  This may be provided in section 30 by developing a protocol under the co-operation agreements and inserting amendments to ensure that individual trade union membership is defined as confidential information under the legislation and its disclosure to official agencies prohibited.  Such a protocol would require careful drafting to ensure it does not preclude the consideration of wages records which involve a deduction for trade union membership subscriptions, nor should it prohibit an investigation of whether such deductions had been paid to the union in question.  Such a provision will be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Section 32, which relates to the display of notices, is important.  Under section 47, NERA inspectors will enforce regulations and recover moneys to employees by serving compliance orders on employers.  NERA already serves notice on employers that they must pay workers moneys owed or they will be taken to court.  Effectively, employers must only pay what they owe and are not subject to added deterrents.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">Nothing is mentioned on the handling of repeat offenders or employers who are served with future compliance notice of breaches.  A potential deterrent to repeat offenders could be added.  In addition, section 47(1) should be changed from "any amount of money" to "the full amount of money" owing to the person.  It is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">It is important that the employment rights of undocumented workers are upheld in the Bill and that inspectors and legal representatives follow this through.  To date, the inspectorate has indicated it cannot or will not seek moneys owed to undocumented workers.  Any bar on the recovery of lost wages by an undocumented worker would lessen the liability of unscrupulous employers and make it more financially attractive to them to hire undocumented workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Supreme Court in the US held that a National Labour Relations Act definition of employees included undocumented aliens and concluded that the abdication of the Act to illegal aliens helps to ensure the wages and employment conditions of lawful residents are not adversely affected by the competition of illegal alien employees who are not subject to standard terms of employment.  It also stated that if an employer realises there would be no advantage under the Act to preferring illegal aliens to legal resident workers, any incentive to hire such illegal aliens is correspondingly lessened.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">In Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Spain workplace rights are not status based.  In Belgium, several laws state that the fact a contract is not valid does not relieve the employer from the duty to employ the rules on minimum wages, industrial action and working hours.  This means workers can seek redress and this is confirmed by several judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">I know my colleague, Deputy Higgins, is very hot on this issue and will refer to it later on.  We will broadly support the Bill, subject to a number amendments we will table.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  For many years we have heard, at various intervals, strong calls for workers' rights to be protected.  It appears to me this only happened when issues arose which came to public attention, such as the case of the Turkish workers and a number of similar cases where exploitation was taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">The purpose of this Bill is to secure better compliance with employment legislation in accordance with provisions in Part 2, sections 11 to 16 of Towards 2016, the ten year framework social partnership agreement which we have in place.  As we know, over recent days and weeks social partnership has come under the spotlight to a great extent.  We must remember that social partnership has served us extremely well over the past 20 years.  It has given us 20 years of stability, growth and improvements in rights, conditions and remuneration for workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">As a country, over the years we have had a strong reputation and history of protecting workers.  As Deputy Penrose mentioned, this probably comes from our culture and history.  We have one of the highest minimum wages in Europe and a raft of legislation in place to protect workers in all sectors of our society.  We were one of the first countries to bring in equal recognition of the rights of women.  We have been very strong on protecting workers' rights to affiliate themselves and be members of unions.  We have continued to do this consistently over the past 20 or 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">As all speakers here have said we are now in a changed time and a different set of circumstances and are all aware of the pressures our economy is under.  People do not want to listen to rhetoric about where we are going and how to get out of this situation.  They want co-operation and an open-minded approach on all sides, whether from inside or outside the House.  They do not want employers and employees to fight with each other.  Rights on both sides, be they for the employer or the employee, bring with them responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Minister said it is intended to table amendments to this Bill.  As public representatives we have all had representations and examples of how, in the current climate, small and medium-sized businesses which have provided employment over the years are suffering.  In my constituency, many of the small and medium-sized shops, hotels and restaurants are under severe pressure and do not need extra pressure.  I am confident any amendments tabled to this Bill will ensure legislation will not be introduced which will jeopardise the livelihood of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses or the people they employ.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Over recent years we have seen, in a relatively short space of time, many workers coming here from other countries.  They came here for a reason and it is not the weather.  They came here because we have good conditions in pay, work, protection and rights.  For many years Irish people emigrated to other countries, specifically for economic reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">In the past ten or 15 years we have managed to turn that around and many people returned to Ireland from all parts of the world to work.  One reason they came back is that they knew the legislation and protections we had in place would ensure that, as workers or employers, they would be protected.  That is one of the attractions we have and it would be a huge shame for us to lose that.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">We have listened to various arguments over the years.  I understand that the position of Labour Party on this issue and that it is caught between a rock and a hard place.  It is affiliated to the unions and over the years it has protected workers' rights, but we must ensure we get the balance right between protecting the rights of worker while not stymying or burying those who are brave enough to take a chance and set up their own business, be it small or medium-sized or in a rural or urban area.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">We must not prevent such people taking a leap and making the step to opening a business and creating employment.  That is the balance we must strike.  I have every confidence that this Government, despite the difficulties and everything else that has been going on, will continue to balance rights on both sides of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Some of points of the Bill have already been discussed.  One which struck me in particular was Part 5, which includes strengthening the obligations of employers and the rights of employees.  The whole point of this Bill is to ensure that employees are not discriminated against or used for illegal or unscrupulous purposes and to protect employee rights.  Some sections in the Bill, particularly section 50, provide immunity for any person who makes a bona fide report on breaches of employment legislation to the director of NERA or an officer of the director, the Minister or the gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">As a corollary, subsection (3) makes it an offence for anyone to report in bad faith to any of those persons.  It is getting the balance right and ensuring we do not have people making false accusations against employers, putting employers in a position where not only is their reputation but their functioning is jeopardised.  That balance is something we have to protect and have managed to protect over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">We need a fair and even-handed implementation of all regulations.  There is no point in imposing extra burdens on employers which result in workers losing out.  Coming back to the detail of the Bill, many of its aspects manage to get the balance right.  There are other sections which will have to be amended, particularly in the current climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">We have all had approaches from people who find themselves in a position where they may be employing two, three or four people or more.  Now, however, they feel that in the current climate, including confusion and uncertainty, they must rationalise their businesses.  They end up being self-employed as a one-man operation.  We are going back to the situation we had in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when people managed to function outside the cover of statutory regulations, for whatever reason.  In recessionary times there is pressure on people to change they way they operate, and while they may not wish to do so, they may feel they have no choice.  The Government must ensure that every opportunity is made available so that employers can continue in business.  In addition, when businesses are under pressure the Government must ensure that unscrupulous employers do not take advantage of indigenous workers or those from other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Parts of the Bill will have to be amended but the thrust of it is correct.  For many years we have led the way in providing protection both for employers and employees.  If we continue to do that it will only stand to us in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFitzpatrickFF" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_965">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which will overhaul the State's employment rights framework.  It will modernise the labour inspectorate, strengthen enforcement of employment rights and work permits, promote greater compliance in the workplace and increase penalties for employers who seek to gain advantage by denying employees their entitlements under the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The main measures proposed in the Bill include the establishment of the national employment rights authority, NERA, on a statutory basis, including appointment by the Minister of the director and a tripartite advisory board.  I agree with those who have asked if we need this additional inspectorate.  Nevertheless, the Bill will also seek to strengthen powers in the area of labour inspection including allowing the director to take evidence on oath, ensuring labour inspectors have greater access to premises, personnel and data, and empowering NERA to prosecute summary offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">The Bill will also empower labour inspectors in NERA to examine employment permits and prosecute offences.  The inspectors will also be able to conduct investigations jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, social welfare inspectors and An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">There will be provision for greater penalties for offences arising under employment law.  Protection of whistleblowers in the event of breaches of employment law being reported in good faith will also be an element of the Bill.  The Minister should examine the penalties for first-time offences, while perhaps considering greater penalties for second offences.  Most employers respect their employees and do not intend to do them any injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Documents must be kept by the employer in respect of the most recent three-year employment period and must be retained by employers for a further two years after the employment relationship ends.  The inclusion of this provision in the Bill is a good step.  This is significant legislation and will have a significant impact in the area of employment rights.  It is a comprehensive package and is an indication of the Government's commitment to the principles of social partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">In the drive for greater competitiveness, there is a need to ensure that responsible employers who meet their obligations to employees will have a level playing field.  It is crucial to have fairness on all sides, both for employers and employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Public representatives get complaints because inspectors appear to turn up at employers' premises at most unusual hours and sometimes when both the employers and their staff are extremely busy.  From my little knowledge of the Garda Síochána, when some gardaí don their uniforms or someone has the title of inspector, some of them become over zealous.  That would, however, be unfair to our good employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I welcome the fact that recently, the employer and trade union interests in the catering sector came to an agreement to fix a set of terms and conditions.  These included minimum pay rates and Sunday premium rates that will apply throughout the country.  Under the new arrangements, employment regulations orders would be made, establishing identical terms and conditions for application throughout the country.  The thinking behind this is that it will remove the disparity between the minimum statutory terms and conditions that currently apply in catering establishments in the greater Dublin area and those that apply elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The agreement would also provide for the extension of a sick pay scheme to cater for workers countrywide.  Workers in the Dublin area are currently paid a minimum rate of at least time plus one third for Sunday work, while for the rest of the country work performed on a Sunday is paid at the rate of double time.  It is important to have equality on this issue.  Fairness should be the buzz word on both sides.  In this time of economic difficulty, all sides must realise that compromise is needed, that we must all work together and play our part in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The preliminary agreement between IBEC and SIPTU is a pragmatic and practical solution.  It shows that through partnership we can make progress.  From a broader viewpoint, taking our economy as a whole, I would urge all social partners to work together as we seek to make readjustments in line with changing times.  The fact that talks with the social partners concluded the way they did earlier this week does not sound the death knell for social partnership.  We should look at the positives — the fact that all sides agreed on what had to be achieved — and continue to seek a joint solution to the current financial situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Employers and employees have a role to play at this time.  Both sides need to be flexible and realise that compromises have to be made.  We must be realistic and understand that our country is going through a time of severe economic change.  Now is not a time for extremism on either side.  Employment has always been something that should be cherished and respected, and in these times even more so.  It not only benefits individuals but also families and communities generally.  All of us who are lucky enough to be working should appreciate that fact.  We should never forget that there are people behind those unemployment statistics.  We have always been known as a caring and practical nation, and long may that continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I have always believed that extremism of any kind is a dangerous thing.  A measured approach in life usually goes a long way.  At this time, flexibility is required from everybody as we seek to stabilise and ultimately return our country to a position of growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The Migrant Rights Centre is a national, non-governmental organisation that works with migrant workers.  They are in a vulnerable situation, particularly those who are experiencing exploitation in the workplace, trafficking for forced labour and those who are undocumented.  I am told by the centre that the exploitation of migrant workers in Ireland, particularly those in low paid, non-unionised jobs, is widespread.  Workplace exploitation constitutes a wide variety of situations, ranging from discriminatory practices in pay and conditions to forced labour.  This exploitation is particularly prominent in sectors that are poorly regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The Bill will have a significant impact on the lives of migrant workers.  We all welcome the Government's initiative to strengthen the enforcement of employment rights and promote greater compliance in the workplace, which adequately addresses the protection of all workers from exploitation.  It is important to protect the employment rights of undocumented workers, and the inspectorate and legal redress mechanisms must follow through on this.  This could be ensured through the Employment Law Compliance Bill.  To date, however, the inspectorate has indicated that it cannot and will not seek moneys owed to the undocumented workers.  Any bar on the recovery of lost wages by the undocumented workers would lessen the liability of unscrupulous employers and make it financially attractive to them to hire undocumented workers.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_408">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_980">Since the publication of the national climate change strategy in 2007, the relevant Departments have been working on the development of further measures to reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  This work is overseen by the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  I have been reporting progress to the Oireachtas on an annual basis whenever I present the carbon budget to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">The focus of the 2007 document was very much on Kyoto compliance over the 2008-12 period.  While the measures now being developed will support this, their longer-term impact is of even more importance.  Significant structural change is required across all sectors of our economy if we are to meet the much more demanding targets to which we are now committing ourselves.  Under the recent EU climate and energy package, Ireland has taken on a target of a 20% reduction in emissions between 2005 and 2020, and this target will increase further when a new global agreement on climate change is reached, hopefully in Copenhagen next December.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The last carbon budget showed a requirement for Government purchases of up to 4.6 million allowances per year over the 2008-12 period.  I noted at the time that this was based on EPA emission projections which assumed economic growth rates similar to those published in the ESRI's medium-term review in May 2008, and that it was already apparent that these forecasts were now over-optimistic.  Since then, in light of the changed economic outlook, the EPA, with the assistance of the ESRI and other relevant agencies, is revising its emission projections.  While this work is not yet complete, I understand that the new projection will be significantly reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The global economic downturn is already leading to a fall in the market price of carbon credits.  While the Government's projections of the cost of the purchasing requirement had assumed an average unit price of €15, markets are currently operating at closer to €11.  Overall, the cost to the Government will be much less than previously forecast, due to the fall in both the volume and unit price of carbon credits.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">I must emphasise that the use of carbon credits must be supplementary to emission reductions and that we must not, under any circumstances, allow the option to purchase credits to deflect from the fundamental objective of taking the necessary actions towards a low-carbon trajectory in the longer term.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">The Minister has indicated that the recession and the contraction of the economy are what he is depending on in order to meet our Kyoto targets——</p>

            <p eId="para_987">——and that there will, as he rightly pointed out, be a serious change from the ESRI's forecast.  There is an estimated contraction of 8% or 9% in the economy in 2009.  Nevertheless, we must still do certain things in order to ensure that we achieve our objectives.  When will work begin on a new national climate change strategy?  Will the Minister indicate, notwithstanding the economic situation, what the likely, if any, purchase of credits will be over the next few years until 2012?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_988">I would like to correct the misleading statement made by the Deputy that we are relying on the recession.  I said no such thing.  What we are relying on is Government action.  We have said over and over again that the climate change strategy will be implemented and have taken the necessary steps to achieve that, through the creation of the Cabinet climate change committee and the Oireachtas committee which is chaired by a member of the Fine Gael Party.  These will oversee the changes we are making and ensure that we make the necessary changes.  I hope Members will support those changes, some of which may be perceived to be unpalatable.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Some fiscal instruments are required and the taxation commission is looking at putting a price on carbon.  This is necessary, as are the other changes we have introduced on building regulations and the changes that allow people opt for low-emission vehicles.  Furthermore, there will be new changes relating to more sustainable methods of travel.  The sustainable transport action plan was launched today.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">These combined changes will mean that we will reduce our emissions.  The Deputy will be aware that we have, for the first time, reduced our emissions by approximately 1%.  I am confident that these combined measures will mean we will comply with our targets for the Kyoto period, 2008 to 2012.  The much more onerous target comes beyond that, the post-Kyoto period.  That is the period when it will be much more difficult to comply with our targets.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_991">I am anxious that the Minister would pursue direct Government action.  However, the action taken to date does not inspire confidence, with only 700,000 tonnes of a reduction out of a 7 million target.  The Minister's initiative on light bulbs seems to have gone from the radar and has been brought into the context of an EU strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">The Minister mentioned transport.  How does he reconcile what he has just said about a sustainable transport plan with the massive number of buses to be taken off the road in Dublin by Dublin Bus?  This is happening in a city that has few alternative options for people other than car use.  If we are anxious to obtain a reduction in car transport, the policy pursued by the Government of removing buses out of circulation will result in more people driving their cars rather than less.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">I intend to bring forward proposals in the near future for legislative change to allow for the introduction of spending limits at local elections.  It is my intention to have the limits in place for the local elections to be held this year.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine spending limits at local elections as part of the Green Paper on local government.  The Green Paper, published in April 2008, outlined two possible approaches, a fixed expenditure ceiling of a set amount per candidate or limits linked to a proportion of Dáil expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">The purpose of introducing spending limits is to create as level a playing field as possible to ensure that candidates of modest means are not put at a disadvantage in contesting an election.  It will also bring local elections in line with other electoral codes where spending limits already apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">In October 2008, I consulted the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issue of spending limits.  A policy research document prepared on behalf of the committee and presented at that meeting offered useful practical guidance.  There are a number of complexities that need to be considered and I discussed these with members of the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">The consultative committee on local government reform, which was involved in the drafting process for the Green Paper on Local Government also considered the issue of expenditure limits.  This committee included representatives from all the main local government associations and representative bodies including the Association of County and City Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland, the County and City Managers Association and the Local Authority Members Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">Under the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, all local election candidates are currently required to submit a declaration of campaign expenditure, and the source of the funds to meet that expenditure.  I believe that these provisions should be built upon, and that candidates should be required to comply with spending limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">However, in setting the limits, a balance has to be struck.  The limits have to be both realistic and reasonable.  If they were set at too low a level, they might unduly hinder campaigning, particularly by new candidates.  Were the limits too high, they would defeat the objective of discouraging excessive spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">Given their different administrative responsibilities, there may be a case for setting different limits for county and city councils on the one hand, and borough and town councils on the other hand.  This is something that is being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">Preparatory work is now at an advanced stage, and I expect to publish a Bill shortly to introduce spending limits for candidates at local elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">I thank the Minister for his response.  It is exactly the same response we received on 7 October 2008 when the Minister briefed the committee.  A number of questions must be asked.  Has the Minister brought this matter to Cabinet?  In correspondence from the Taoiseach to the leader of my party in December there was discussion of complexities.  There are no complexities in this.  Local candidates must furnish financial information on their campaigns.  What they need is a limit to be placed upon it.  If this creates difficulties in terms of administration it also creates many benefits and a level playing field.  It is an important factor in safeguarding against corruption.  The Minister is on record, and I have stated in this Chamber and in committee, that there is a direct correlation between election spending and election outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">The Minister has not delivered on this issue.  He has given us the same response he gave to the committee on 7 October.  There are 16 weeks to go to the next local elections, which is just over 100 days.  When will the Minister bring forward this legislation?  The Minister mentioned two approaches.  There are several approaches.  Which one will the Minister choose?</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">On the one hand Deputy Lynch states there are issues which need to be examined and, on the other, that there are no complexities.  There are complexities and there is no question about it.  If one considers the variation in population, and this will be based on population, the electoral areas range from a low of 6,470 to a high of 51,803.  This is a huge variation.  How does one allocate spending on this basis?  This is what we must try to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">In my reply, I stated there are issues with regard to some of the borough councils and these must be teased out.  Next week, I hope to be in a position to announce this.  Given that Deputy Lynch has highlighted the difficulties, stated that people have advantages and agreed with me that this needs to be done I hope he will welcome my initiative.  I am sure he will find a way to criticise it in some shape or form.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The limit for a three seat Dáil constituency at present is €30,150.  The Green Paper recommends this is halved to €15,000.  We must examine this and consider whether this is the way to go.  My thinking is that it is and I hope that next week Deputy Lynch will be out on the plinth welcoming this.</p>

Yes, there are complexities but they are not unknown complexities.  The complexities are related to population, various limits and urban and rural areas.  I have discussed these with the Minister at committee meetings.  Has the Minister brought the matter to Cabinet?  Will next week's announcement give us a specific date?  Candidates in the field need to know the limitations of their expenditure.  I welcome the indication this afternoon that the Minister is beginning to move on this matter at last.  However, the vast majority of the Minister's response is a repetition of what we heard on 7 October.</p>

            <p eId="para_1068">I remain committed to building on the success of recycling in recent years despite the recent downturn in recyclable markets.  I am glad to say there is now evidence of some market recovery, particularly for good-quality segregated material.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">I raised the issue at the Environment Council in Brussels on 4 December 2008 and 12 member states supported my intervention.  The European Commission has undertaken to carry out a review of the matter and to revert to us with options for action.  Ireland also raised the issue at the December meeting of the EU Technical Committee on Packaging Waste.  At our suggestion, a database of outlets for such material is being compiled by this committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_1071">The storage of recyclables and any associated costs are a matter for the owners of the material.  No funding has been provided by my Department for such storage, nor is it envisaged that it will do so in 2009.</p>

The Irish have made huge strides in recycling waste and it would be a pity if this great progress were reversed because of the lack of market opportunities for our products abroad.  Will the Minister indicate where the markets for recyclables are likely to develop?  Such markets existed up to six months ago.  Does the Minister believe a more balanced market will come into being and that opportunities will develop in countries such as China, to which many Irish recyclable goods were exported in the past?</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">A number of meetings have taken place with Repak and a number of sub-groups are driving action in the recycling market.  A meeting took place on 6 January last at which it emerged the material is now moving and that the amount of recyclables in storage has reduced.  Repak estimated that approximately 8,000 to 10,000 tonnes are currently in temporary storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Markets have reopened and prices recovered slightly in December but there is a problem with plastics, due in large part to the low price of oil at present.  It is strange to say we need to ensure we have higher oil prices but it is a fact because recyclable plastics will not move otherwise.  There is no movement in the Chinese market in particular.  The paper and cardboard markets, particularly for paper and cardboard of better quality, are recovering but there is still a problem with plastics.  I am trying as best I can to ensure we have some movement in this area.  We have invested an additional €2 million, which will bring the total fund up to €14 million in 2009.  This is to assist the local authorities with the operational costs associated with their recycling facilities.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1077">Under the social housing investment programme, local authorities have traditionally met social housing needs mainly through the construction of housing in local authority estates.  In recent years, the supply channels have been expanded to include an increased number of acquisitions, in particular under Part V agreements, and through arrangements with private landlords under the rental accommodation scheme.  At the same time there has also been an expansion in the volume of accommodation provided by voluntary and co-operative housing bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The new leasing initiative, under which authorities will procure properties on long-term leases of ten to 20 years, is designed to widen further the sources of supply and thereby help create a flexible range of delivery mechanisms for local authorities to meet demand for social housing.  The use of leasing arrangements will allow for a substantial increase in the number of households that will have their housing needs met over what would otherwise be possible.  It is expected that, through this measure, at least 2,000 additional homes will be procured this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">Under the initiative it will be a matter for each local authority to determine what properties and locations are suitable for social housing.  In putting forward leasing proposals, local authorities will be expected to have regard to the Department's guidelines for social housing, and all proposals must be consistent with the policy of creating sustainable communities.  As with all social housing investment, local authorities will have to ensure on a case-by-case basis that value for money is achieved.  Overall, however, I am satisfied this approach will facilitate the effective and efficient use of public finances.  To this end, I have provided €20 million within this year's housing budget to meet leasing costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1080">Some €20 million of taxpayers' money is to be used for renting 2,000 social housing units.  Contracts of between ten and 20 years will be signed in this regard.  The cost over a ten-year period will be €200 million and the cost for a 20-year period will be €400 million.  This seems like a great deal of money.  How will the scheme compare to the equity scheme?  If it does not fit in with it, there will be dead money and no value for money.  Will the Minister of State explain the background to the scheme and why it is proceeding at this stage?  The Government recently introduced the home choice loan scheme.  Will the Minister of State comment on how this is working?</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">The moneys available to local authorities and the voluntary groups in 2009 for housing programmes is close to €1 billion.  The sum for the leasing programme amounts to €20 million.  The home choice loan is provided through the local authority system.  The equity loan will be dealt with under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 that will be before the Dáil in a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The €20 million will deal with over 2,000 people on the housing list and I am happy that this represents good value for money.  Everybody knows there are many vacant properties, perhaps 40,000.  There are over 56,000 people listed on the local authority waiting lists that were submitted to me.  I am responsible for addressing the needs of all those on the list and I have proposed this additional measure because I am satisfied on the question of value for money.</p>

We want to ensure the money is used to best effect.  Those in local authority houses for ten to 20 years should have an option of ultimately purchasing them.  The moneys they pay in rent should contribute towards their purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">Where will the 2,000 units be located?  Is the scheme a pilot project and will additional units be made available over the years?  Will the Minister of State be reviewing the housing strategy in view of the downturn?</p>

            <p eId="para_1085">It will not be possible to purchase a house under the scheme as it is a leasing scheme.  It will not be any different from taking a local authority house because the landlord will be the local authority or the voluntary body.  There is a great similarity and the differential rent will apply.  One will not be entitled to purchase.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 includes an incremental purchase scheme.  Tenants who feel they are in a position to move towards a purchase will be able to do so under this scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1092">The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007 provide for a system of permitting by local authorities of commercial waste collection activities and for nominated local authorities to attach such conditions as they consider necessary to give effect to the objectives of the statutory regional waste management plans, including in respect of recyclates.  Enforcement of a permit is a matter for the relevant local authority and my Department has no direct function in this matter.  I will continue to keep the regulations under review in the light of experience and in the context of the overall review of waste policy which is currently taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">Concerning the issue of the downturn in the market for recyclates, my Department, by circular letter issued on 4 December 2008, advised local authorities of the increased risk of breaches of waste collection permit conditions and activities such as fly-tipping and illegal dumping as a consequence of this downturn.  Local authorities were asked to use the powers available to them to counter any such developments and thus to maintain support for ongoing efforts to increase recycling to meet national objectives and EU obligations.  In support of local authority enforcement action, my Department is allocating €10.8 million for waste enforcement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">I can confirm that my Department is not aware of any cases of non-collection of recyclates by collectors, with the exception of a short-term issue in the Dublin area around Christmas last, which appears to have related to the transfer of a contract rather than to the downturn in the recyclates market and which was addressed by the local authority and the new contractor.</p>

            <p eId="para_1100">In the context of the new international review that we are conducting on waste management, we are examining the issue of deposit schemes and how they can be used.  A number of innovative proposals have been made in regard to litter, especially cans and bottles, which have real merit.  I refer in particular to vending machines, which encourage young people especially to bring back bottles and cans.  That has been shown to be most effective not just in regard to recycling, but more particularly in dealing with the litter problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">The circular I issued means that the brown bins are being rolled out.  They have been rolled out in Dublin.  That is vital if we are to comply with the landfill directive, especially the amount of biodegradable waste that is going to landfill.  The brown bins can make a major contribution to that.  Most people are complying with that.  There are some initial teething problems but overall the roll-out of the brown bin will make a significant contribution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1107">What I said was that it would be a last resort.  We must look at those substances that have a high calorific value and consider what we do with plastics.  I said previously that in combination with mechanical biological treatment, MBT, which is what is done elsewhere, we would examine separating out those materials that have a high calorific value.  I refer to black bin waste that can go into an MBT plant.  That can be separated out and it is what is done elsewhere.  Our record on this issue is poor because we do not, and have not used, cement kilns in any way, unlike other European states.  There is not a need for the amount of incinerators that have been planned.  I said that consistently.  My preference in terms of conversion technology has always been that we consider pyrolysis and gasification, which are higher up the recycling chain or the waste hierarchy.  Cement kilns have a role to play and they play an important role elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 58 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">Under the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No.2) Order 2008, the powers delegated to me in my capacity as a Minister of State include the powers conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, other than sections 153, 154, 155 and 180 of that Act.  The specific sections referred to relate to appointments to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the appointment of a chairperson of the board and issues relating to the board's annual report and accounts; accordingly these matters remain the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While the other powers contained in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 are delegated to me, it should be noted that under the delegation of functions legislation, every delegated power and duty continues to be vested in the Minister concurrently with the Ministers of State and may be exercised and performed by either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">On foot of concerns regarding the procedural and technical correctness of a number of appointments to the Dispute Resolution Committee, DRC, brought to my Department's attention by the board in December 2008, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2009 was introduced to regularise the appointments in question.  Those concerns related to a number of appointments to the DRC that had not complied with the requirement under section 159(3) of the original Act that a member of the board must have at least three years remaining in their board term of office to be appointed to the Dispute Resolution Committee.  In introducing the regularising legislation, it was decided, for the avoidance of doubt, also to regularise DRC appointments from the perspective of the requirement to consult with the Minister, as documentary evidence was not available to show that those consultation requirements had been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">I am circulating in the Official Report a table setting out the names and periods of appointment of the 15 non-board members currently appointed to the Dispute Resolution Committee.  The fees payable to members of the DRC were sanctioned by the Department of Finance in November 2005 and have subsequently been increased in line with general round pay increases.  The current fee for members of a tenancy tribunal drawn from the Dispute Resolution Committee is €387 per day.  The fee for the chairperson of such tribunals is €603 per day.</p>

            <p eId="para_1162">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for his response.  I wish to recap on the position we were at a week ago when the legislation was introduced into the House on an emergency basis.  Twelve illegal appointments have been made to the PRTB to date.  While I understand the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not involved in the operational day-to-day running of the board, ultimately, the buck stops with him regarding these illegal appointments because he signed off on them.  When we debated this issue on 9 October 2008, I asked the Minister five times how it came to his attention that two illegal appointments had been made but he failed to reply on each occasion.  I also suggested that he should carry out an audit of other appointments to the PRTB, which he also failed to do.  How did the issue of the ten illegal appointments come to the Minister of State's attention?  I have a fair idea how it happened but I would like him to put on record how that came about.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">Daily fees are €600 and €387.  What is the current caseload?  Has anybody in the Department read the Act?  Both myself and my personal assistant have read it back to front and the illegal appointments did not result from a misinterpretation of the legislation.  The Act is explicit on this matter, the illegal appointment of two councillors and the synchronisation of appointments to the DRC and the PRTB.</p>

The compliance audit was completed in January 2009 and it identified no similar issues requiring legislative correction.</p>

The difficulties referred to by the Minister of State arose on 10 December and the audit was carried out after that.  Why were shadow spokespersons such as myself and Deputy Hogan kept in the blind about this?</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">The issue came to the attention of the Minister of State and the Department because somebody who was before a DRC pointed out it was operating illegally and it was not discovered by the PRTB.  No audit was carried out.  An individual who was before a committee noticed it was operating illegally and brought it to the Minister of State's attention.  He should not state this was identified as a result of an audit.  The audit to which he referred was carried out after the second mistake was discovered.  I take on board there may not be difficulties following the audit but the mistake was not discovered by the audit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1181">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 218 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">I held a public consultation regarding the control of postering for elections and referenda in autumn 2008.  Following the analysis of submissions received by my Department, I informed the Government on 27 January that I intend to pilot test certain measures in the upcoming local and European elections to evaluate their impact on the proliferation of posters and the litter arising during those election campaigns.  Local authorities are being asked to pilot four options in a number of local authority areas; the use of biodegradable plastic ties or colour coding of plastic ties; the display of posters to be restricted to designated areas only; the numbers of posters per candidate to be restricted; and the numbers of posters to be restricted to two per pole, back to back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The pilot scheme will be evaluated following completion with a view to informing future policy development regarding the control of postering for elections and referenda.  It is important that potential problems relating to implementation or enforcement of the measures are identified prior to legislation being introduced to ensure that the final legislation is as effective as possible.  I will ask all candidates, local and European, in each of the participating areas to participate in the scheme in order that it is as comprehensive and representative as possible.  I am also reviewing the litter legislation to ensure there is absolutely no doubt that posters cannot be erected before an election has been called and I will bring forward an amendment if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1185">In consultation with local authorities, I am asking them to examine the various options I outlined.  They can pick from these options to ascertain which ones are most appropriate to their area and I hope most of them will buy into this.  I will meet managers and representative bodies of councillors, which is most important because we must have political buy in, and ask them which option is most appropriate for the upcoming local elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1188">I worked as an adult literacy organiser prior to my election to the House and I was involved in the campaign to ensure candidate's photographs were printed on ballot papers.  Posters operate in a similar fashion, particularly in local elections.  They allow people to discriminate between one side of the road and the other regarding their local candidate.  Posters are an informative and valuable tool for local democracy.  Following the pilot scheme, will legislation be in place to govern postering during the upcoming local elections?  Will local authorities opt in and out?  Is there the potential that one local authority will be operating one system and another operating another one?  A key part of my submission is that we need a national system and not a localised one.</p>

            <p eId="para_1189">I agree with many of the points made by the Deputy on the role of posters.  They are essential.  It was never my intention to ban postering.  The intention was to introduce some form of regulation so that we would not have the somewhat chaotic postering we have.  It is getting worse with successive elections.  We received 117 submissions, including that of the Deputy.  Many referred to the plastic tag issue.  We are trying to deal with that.  Deputy Hogan referred to litter previously.  Having a proliferation of plastic tags is a serious litter problem and we want to try to deal with that.  We do not want to restrict public speech or people's right to expression.  That is not what this is about.  However, I have seen candidates putting four or five posters on a pole, which is excessive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">We have come up with a reasonable approach having considered all the submissions made.  In my reply I said we would not introduce legislation until we have an idea of what is workable, which is a good approach.  In the past local authorities have introduced their own pilot schemes with buy-in from councillors.  Residents' associations have asked candidates not to put their posters in particular areas.  On the whole we have had the co-operation of the council and councillors.</p>

My election workers cut down the tags and took them away to be recycled.  There are many common sense candidates and people involved in politics who took away their own litter.  I urge the Minister to take on board these proposals.  Posters form a very important part of any democratic campaign.</p>

It is pandering to people who treat democracy and elections as if they are some kind of untidy intrusion on their lives.  Deputies McGrath and Ciarán Lynch are correct.  Postering is a cheap way to promote democracy.  It is fine for those who can afford to pay for billboards and bus shelters.  However, restricting the number of posters will impact most on people with the least money to spend on elections — smaller parties and Independents.  I do not know why the Minister is spending time on this and going to the trouble of having pilot schemes.  We put up posters for the duration of the election campaign and then ensure we take them down.</p>

Deputy Tuffy’s colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, made a submission on the matter, which indicates his interest in it.  The restriction will come from the restriction on spending.  My party has never had a billboard as far as I know.  We do not have the resources to engage in lavish spending.  In fact we have the lowest spending of any political party.  I understand the necessity of getting out cheap advertising.  I also understand the necessity of dealing with the litter problem, which is what we are trying to do.  We are getting a sensible compromise through the measures we are adopting.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">I refer to the reply to Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper, in which I outlined the range of work under way across all sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the review being undertaken to ensure that emission projections reflect the changing economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 sets out the measures on foot of which Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol.  Compliance will be determined on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions over the period.  The strategy places a significant emphasis on transport in recognition of the proportion of total emissions attributed to the transport sector.  A modal shift to public transport was signalled in the strategy as a key measure in achieving reductions in transport emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">Greenhouse gas emissions from transport present one of the greatest challenges for many countries, including Ireland.  We need to take radical action to turn that situation around and we need to do it quickly.  Earlier today, the Minister for Transport published the new strategy entitled Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future.  I welcome the publication of this Government action plan to free our towns and cities from choking traffic congestion, slash CO2 emissions and help car-based commuters to leave their cars at home.  The plan represents a radical transformation in transport policy that puts people, rather than vehicles, first and has the potential to fundamentally change how we all travel.  It will lead to a more sustainable transport system that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide a better quality of life for all.</p>

I am sure Deputies will recall that unfortunately, there have been archaic work practices in that organisation.  Even the slightest change is resisted.  Over many years we had disputes over the opening of the middle door.  We have tried to get integrated ticketing and real-time information so that people waiting at bus stops know when the bus will arrive.  Unfortunately that has failed.

            <p eId="para_1226">My Department is currently preparing proposals to strengthen the existing legislation on noise pollution, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.  A public consultation process has been completed, and account is being taken of submissions received from the public and key stakeholders. While there is already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources,  I intend that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution.  There will be a greater emphasis on codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  Local authorities will have stronger enforcement powers to deal with nuisances from particular noise sources such as continuously sounding alarms, and I also see the need to extend the powers of the Garda Síochána in certain circumstances.  There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of noise nuisance and of how it can be remedied.</p>

A total of 235 submissions were received which shows there is significant public interest in this issue.  We are becoming an increasingly urbanised society.  Stricter laws governing noise are in force in European countries and it is time we got our act together to ensure people can simply enjoy in some cases a good night's sleep.  It is a quality of life issue and it should not be dismissed.  I agree with Deputy Hogan that it is a serious issue and we are giving it the attention it deserves.</p>

I am aware that different local authorities have been undertaking a review of such noise levels.  Cork City Council has undertaken examinations of noise levels along the South Link Road and in other parts of the city.  What progress has been made?  People cannot go out into their back gardens because there is a four-lane highway at the end of the garden and no noise barriers or noise insulation measures have been installed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 24 and 28 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The fee for making submissions or observations to An Bord Pleanála for development under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 is €50.  The board is legally obliged to consider all submissions or observations before making a decision.  Third parties also have the right to be notified of any new significant information provided by an applicant; request an oral hearing; and be notified of the decision of the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">The fee for making submissions or observations to a planning authority in respect of a planning application is €20.  It was introduced in the context of the comprehensive review of planning legislation that culminated in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  The revised legislation provided increased rights for third parties in the planning process.  Since the enactment of the 2000 Act planning authorities are statutorily obliged to acknowledge submissions on planning applications and to consider those submissions before making decisions on planning applications.  Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of any new information provided; the decision of the planning authority; and an appeal against the decision of the planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">In a 2006 judgment, the European Court of Justice ruled that this €20 fee could not be regarded as constituting an obstacle to public participation in the planning process.  I have no proposals for the abolition of these fees.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_1248">The first question was about the Planning (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 which set the fee for making a submission to An Bord Pleanála at €50.  When the Bill was going through the House in 2006, the Minister who was then an Opposition Deputy, was opposed to the charging of fees.  He said he did not think people should be charged for making submissions under this Act.  He also called for the removal of the €20 fee for making a submission about a planning application.  This view is in keeping with the Labour Party policy that people should feel free to make submissions and comments about planning applications and not feel constrained by the cost from doing so.  We want to encourage people to make submissions and it might not always be an objection to a planning application but rather a request for concerns to be taken into account by the planning authority.  Will the Minister be getting rid of these fees?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_1249">I indicated in my reply that the European Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion to the effect that the €20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application for a development which requires environmental impact assessment was contrary to the public participation provisions.  The Commission was of the view that the directive makes no express provision for the payment of a participation fee and suggested that the submission fee could act as an impediment.  The court found that the Commission's allegation was without foundation in its entirety.  Given our own economic situation and the fact that the planning authorities and the local authorities need some extra revenue, it would not make sense at this time to abolish those fees.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_571" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_1257">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">The changes I introduced last year to charge motor tax on new cars based on their  CO2 emissions, together with the linked changes to vehicle registration tax introduced by the Minister for Finance, provided significant financial incentives to purchase new low emission cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The two lowest CO2 bands for motor tax — bands A and B — are significantly lower than the minimum annual car tax rate of €172 charged under the engine size cc system.  The motor tax rate for cars in band C is on par with the average tax rate charged under the old system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The VRT rate imposed on cars in these three bands is also lower than the previous minimum rate charged prior to July 2008.  The lowest rate of VRT is now 14% compared to the old minimum of 22.5%. The system of vehicle registration tax is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and issues regarding it are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The incentives provided by the Government have been successful in ensuring a dramatic shift towards the purchase of more environmentally friendly cars.  A total of 85% of all cars registered under the new system are in the lower bands A, B and C and are subject to a very favourable tax regime.  The introduction of emissions based VRT and motor tax had a dual objective of encouraging a move to lower emission vehicles while protecting central and local government revenues.  It is my intention to keep these dual objectives under review, in conjunction with the motor industry, in the light of experience of the new system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">Global economic conditions have had a significant impact on the motor industry internationally, and Ireland is no different.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, has put forward a number of proposals to Government on the car market and my Department met a delegation yesterday to discuss issues relevant to my departmental brief.  The core SIMI proposal related to a scrappage scheme, and that is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Unlike VRT, motor tax receipts depend on the total taxed vehicle fleet, and the motor tax rates charged, rather than the purchase of new vehicles.  The economic slowdown is likely to impact on the total vehicle fleet.  In 2008, the increase in the fleet was in the order of 2.3% compared to an annual average increase of 5% since 2000, and little growth may be evident in the fleet in 2009.  Forecast motor tax receipts for 2009 are of the order of €1.08 billion.  All motor tax receipts are paid directly into the local government fund for local government purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">My Department will continue to keep the position regarding the motor tax receipts under review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_1265">There Minister will be aware there is a serious problem in the motor trade.  Fine Gael advocates that the emissions bands should be backdated to 2001 — the Minister had the information available for new and second hand cars — to allow people make informed decisions regarding emissions.  We support the new regime.  People should have a choice of purchasing based on emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">Is there any new initiative, particularly in the Border counties, that can be introduced to stop dealers going across the Border and coming back with a car having paid VRT in the other jurisdiction and making a few euro in terms of sustaining the trade?  There is a big increase in the number of imported vehicles at the expense of new cars being sold in this jurisdiction.</p>

            <p eId="para_1270">The SIMI has been lobbying for the introduction of a scrappage scheme for cars over ten years, and that involves a reduction in vehicle registration tax.  These are matters for the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">While a scrappage scheme could reduce CO2 emissions it should be noted that Ireland now has a relatively modern vehicle fleet.  There are already incentives in place, and people are availing of those incentives.  When they are purchasing a car they are moving towards the lower bands, and 85% of the new car purchases are in those lower bands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">We will have to examine what the SIMI is advocating but this problem is not unique to Ireland.  We have had a global downturn and as we have seen, the motor industry in the United States is experiencing a serious problem, likewise in Britain and Germany where the car manufacturing industries are under real threat.  It is a phenomenon whereby during an economic downturn people do not change their cars as often as they would in good times.  That is the position, unfortunately.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">Gabhaim buiochas leis an Ceann Comhairle as an deis seo chun géarchéim na noispidéil a chur arís os comhair na Dála.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to again put before the Minister for Health and Children and the Dáil the crisis facing communities, patients and health care workers in Counties Cavan and Monaghan if the Minister and the Health Service Executive proceed with their plan to finally destroy Monaghan General Hospital and to push Cavan General Hospital to breaking point.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">My raising the crisis today is prompted by this week's open letter from 41 general practitioners in Counties Cavan and Monaghan expressing alarm regarding the safety of the proposed ending of acute inpatient care at Monaghan General Hospital and the replacement of its 56 beds with six medical assessment unit beds in Cavan General Hospital.  The letter announced the withdrawal of GP representation from HSE planning groups on the so-called transformation of hospital services in Cavan and Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The withdrawal of the GPs removes the HSE's last pretence that this process has anything to do with improved patient care or moving care closer to the patient.  These key primary health care providers have made clear that the safety of patients will be at risk if acute inpatient care at Monaghan is axed as planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The Minister for Health and Children Mary Harney must listen to the GPs who are saying that the safety implications of the plan are such that they require the HSE to provide a full independent risk assessment of the closure of the 56 beds and of the capacity of GPs to provide a safe service in such circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">It is very significant that the GPs have pointed out that the HSE is attempting to replace 56 acute medical beds in Monaghan with six beds in the medical assessment unit in Cavan General Hospital.  The GPs do not regard this as a replacement, and rightly so.  It represents a cut in services overall and will place an untenable burden on an already over-stretched Cavan General Hospital.  If the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE refuse to act on the call of the Cavan-Monaghan GPs, the gross irresponsibility of their plans will be more clearly exposed than ever.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Today the County Monaghan domiciled Deputies for Cavan and Monaghan met with the Minister for Health and Children, Professor Brendan Drumm, chief executive officer of the HSE, and Michael Scanlon, Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.  I have no hesitation in stating that there was no real engagement with the Minister, Deputy Harney, for whom the meeting appeared to be little more than a sufferance.  While Professor Drumm did engage, it was deeply disappointing that he concluded by reaffirming that the HSE's pace of change will proceed.  That is most worrying and, with potentially very serious consequences for me, my family, my community, my county and my constituency.  At this 11th hour I urge that the madness now stop.</p>

            <p eId="para_1283">I wish to thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for the opportunity to participate with him in this debate, which is extremely important as far as our constituents are concerned in Cavan and Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">On Wednesday, 10 December last, the Minister, Deputy Harney, met with a group of practitioners from Monaghan after which the doctors concerned sent a letter to the Minister emphasising their grave concerns regarding the proposed closure of acute medical services and causality services in Monaghan General Hospital.  They also emphasised that the hospital provides safe, efficient and assessable health care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">Since that meeting and as Deputy Ó Caoláin said, 41 GPs from Cavan and Monaghan have demanded a full independent risk assessment regarding the safety of the proposed closure of 56 acute beds in Monaghan General Hospital and their replacement with six medical assessment beds in Cavan General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">The GPs are clearly worried about their own capacity to provide a safe service in the circumstances where acute services have been removed from Monaghan and have advised that there will be no further GP representation on any of the HSE planning groups regarding transformation or the medical assessment unit development.  It is clear from the doctors' statement published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> and from a discussion today between four Members representing the Monaghan part of the constituency, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, Professor Drumm, chief executive of the HSE, and Mr. Michael Scanlon, Secretary General of the Department, that consultation between the general practitioners and the consultants has not been the order of the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">While the Members had a frank and open discussion with Professor Drumm through the Minister, it was clear her involvement or interest was less than productive.  It is vital at this late stage that the general practitioners and consultants be involved in any discussion or decision towards a safe service.  This can only be done through the retention of the acute medical service, the intensive care ward and the accident and emergency treatment room.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">This is a last ditch request from all the constituents of Cavan-Monagahan.  Four Members of the constituency have united to some degree on this matter because we realise the damage that could be done to lives.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1289">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The overriding aim of the transformation programme for the north-east region, which the Minister fully supports, is to improve safety and achieve better standards of care for patients in the region.  This process involves widespread and fundamental change and is designed to build a health system in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  The transformation programme has been informed by the teamwork report to the HSE, which demonstrated the service configuration in the region was unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">A series of focused service changes is being implemented across the region.  The immediate focus is the reconfiguration of existing services by moving acute and complex care from five hospital sites, including Cavan and Monaghan, to two, including Cavan for Cavan-Monaghan.  With regard to the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, the HSE intends to complete the transfer of acute inpatient services from Monaghan to Cavan over the coming months and to develop additional services in Monaghan.  The transfer of acute medical care to Cavan is due to take place during the second quarter of this year.  It is also subject to several dependencies first being in place, particularly the establishment of a medical assessment unit at Cavan and the development of an enhanced ambulance and pre-hospital thrombolysis service.  The Minister has been assured the transfer will not take place until two months after the medical assessment unit has opened.  The existing medical wards at Monaghan will provide rehabilitation and step-down services with 26 beds, including 13 for rehabilitation and 13 beds for step-down care.  This will be in addition to the day surgery, outpatient and minor injury services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">The change process in Cavan-Monaghan is being managed through a network of sub-groups.  It is important that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the change process.  The HSE has sought the participation of general practitioners, and several sub-groups particularly, in the development of the medical assessment unit in Cavan.  It is a matter of some concern that the general practitioners in Cavan and Monaghan felt it necessary to withdraw from engagement and involvement in these groups.  The HSE has indicated it will ensure communication lines are maintained with general practitioners in the area.  The sub-groups are being supported by specialist risk advisers to ensure the change process is managed smoothly and any associated risks or challenges are identified and addressed in advance of any service changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The changes proposed by the HSE, and fully supported by the Government, are for reasons of patient safety.  We are committed to providing the best possible service for patients in a manner that ensures quality and safety.  It is understandable there will be concerns about change but the Government is satisfied this is the best way forward.  The HSE will work with all stakeholders to bring about the improvements in a carefully planned way that puts patients first.</p>

            <p eId="para_1297">In 1999, the then Western Health Board was requested to put together a group to conduct an inquiry into allegations of the events that took place in these institutions.  In April 1999, six people were appointed to the review group by the health board and asked to report.  By August 2001, all members, apart from the chairperson, appointed had either departed or resigned.  The chairperson subsequently departed the scene without any report being furnished or made available in January 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">After I kicked up a row in the House about this following my re-election in 2007, the HSE appointed Dr. Kevin McCoy to review the work done and, ultimately, a report was published of a limited nature in November 2007.  The report was limited because Dr. McCoy was placed in an impossible position whereby he had to review documentation and notes of interviews put together by the first committee.  In dealing with the totality of the allegations made about these institutions, the report was grossly inadequate.  At a hearing held by the Joint Committee on Health and Children on 24 June 2008, Dr. McCoy accepted his terms of reference were limited, with the result that the job he could do was also limited.  None of this is a critique of Dr. McCoy; he did the best he could in difficult circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">I have raised this matter on a variety of occasions by way of parliamentary questions to get a report of some description published.  A report was eventually published in November 2007.  On the Adjournment debate on 13 December 2007, I dealt with my concerns about the adequacy of this report and the need for an inquiry into why it took eight years for the Western Health Board to publish any sort of a report.  Then I expressed the view, which I still hold, that it was an absolute scandal and disgrace that people suffering from intellectual disabilities, who came forward to make complaints about abuse and were interviewed, were left for eight years without knowing any outcome.  There we were in December 2007, eight years later, with a raft of recommendations for the HSE, most of which had yet to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">On the Adjournment on 13 December 2007, the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, accepted the delay that had occurred was not acceptable.  He announced: "I have arranged to have an immediate inquiry carried out by an independent person into the causes of the delay in preparing this report.  The person will be asked to report to me as quickly as possible."  He then made various commitments with regard to recommendations made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">Subsequently, Mr. John Hynes, the former Secretary General of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the inquiry.  It was to cover questions such as what went wrong, why did people resign, why did it take eight years to produce a report and was it adequate in addressing the issues raised.  Mr. Hynes was to report by 31 July 2008, which was confirmed by a parliamentary question in April 2008.  He failed to do so but from several parliamentary questions I learned he did report by 31 October 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">Since then I have been seeking to obtain a copy of his report.  In the public interest, it should be published and made available to Members.  We need to know what went wrong.  The Western Health Board has already been the subject of a report on the Kelly Fitzgerald case 1996.  At a time when a proper investigation was to be carried out into what was occurring in the Brothers of Charity institutions, it was the Western Health Board that was scandalously failing to provide the intervention and care needed for those children in Roscommon whose tragic plight was debated here last week.  I sought this report under the Freedom of Information Act and have been told by the Department in reply, "While it would be in the public interest to have access to the report and show the decision-making process, I feel the public interest would be harmed with the premature release of the report."  How can it be a premature release as we are now ten years on from when the Western Health Board was first requested to investigate the scandal?  The reply continues, "Such a release would impair a future decision, could contaminate the decision-making process and would impair the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant or substantial degree without countervailing benefit to the public."</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">I demand of the Minister, in the public interest, that there be transparency and accountability, and that this report be published.  The victims of abuse should know why it took eight years for the Western Health Board to carry out its review —  in effect, it took the Western Health Board five years and the HSE another two years.  Why did these delays occur?  We need the answers and to know the adequacy of the investigation originally conducted.  The Minister should publish the report.  This is a cover-up of the gross inadequacies within our health service and the particular failings of the former Western Health Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1306">I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney.  Most of the following has been outlined by Deputy Shatter but I will read it into the record.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">In December 2007 the report of Dr. Kevin McCoy on the Western Health Board inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Brothers of Charity Services in Galway was published.  The Western Health Board's inquiry had been formally established on 21 April 1999.  I am really only repeating what has been said.  Mr. John Hynes, former Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, was subsequently contracted by the Department of Health and Children to review the circumstances surrounding the lapse of time in bringing to completion the Western Health Board inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Brothers of Charity Services, Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">Mr. Hynes submitted his report to the Department of Health and Children on 30 October 2008.  However, the Department of Health and Children is not in a position to release this report until all issues arising, including legal matters, have been fully considered.  A request for the release of the report was recently made to the Department of Health and Children by the Deputy under the Freedom of Information Act.  However, this request was refused by the Department's decision makers under section 20(1), Deliberative Process, 21(1)(<i>a</i>) and 21(1)(<i>b</i>) Functions and Negotiations of a Public Body, of the Freedom of Information Acts.  It would be inappropriate for me or the Department of Health and Children to comment further on the matter raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">I will take on board the comments of the Deputy and will try to arrange a meeting between him and officials to see how we can move this on.</p>

          <heading>Multi-Denominational Schools.</heading>
          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_587">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_1310">I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me in raising this matter, which concerns enabling the Educate Together movement to be recognised as a patron to operate a secondary school in this country.  I will give some context.  We have 3,300 primary schools catering for a population of approximately 486,000 pupils.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that figure will grow to anywhere between 500,000 and 650,000, depending on projections between now and 2025.  We have a growing population that does not leave school when it reaches sixth class at 12 years old.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">There is a demand among the 56 schools currently operated by Educate Together to be allowed continue that ethos into the secondary level.  This ethos is basically a multi-denominational setting within which parents of all faiths — some are secular, humanist or would profess to have no faith in the traditional sense — would like their children to be brought up in tolerance and harmony with each other and with a mutual respect for the diversity of views that now represents multicultural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">In the greater Dublin area there are approximately 28 Educate Together schools, just over half the total of 56 around the country.  The catchment area for a secondary school is much wider than that of a primary school and if located on a transport route, the catchment area can be extended further.  The Department has consistently refused to recognise the Educate Together movement, which currently operates 56 primary schools and is the fastest-growing patron in that sector, as a patron for second level.  No proper explanation has been given, although it has been indicated that educational policy is under review in some way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Nevertheless there is a contradiction in north County Dublin where two primary schools have opened and are operating under the aegis of the VECs, which have no legal status as patrons of a primary school.  I am grateful for the Minister of State's presence, although I do not believe he is attached to the Department of Education and Science.  I have been trying to discover why it is that the Department of Education and Science will tolerate the operation of a primary school by a body, recognised as a patron in the secondary sector but which does not have the legal status to be a patron in the primary sector,  while refusing to grant patron status to a clearly successful and growing body in multicultural Ireland.  It does not make sense.  They currently have 56 primary schools and, on foot of demand from parents and pupils, they want to have a secondary school to continue the ethos into which they have been educated at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">We need more post-primary schools.  In different parts of the urbanising population, as noted in county development and local area plans, there are designated areas for a post-primary school.  Decisions have yet to be made as to what form of patron will be in that school.  The Catholic church, which was the traditional patron in post-primary schools, is in retreat in that area.  They want to maintain their own ethos and under our Constitution they are perfectly entitled to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">Approximately 50% of the post-primary schools in our country are in the VEC, community college or community comprehensive sector.  We have professed in this country a commitment to a diversity of provision in education that is embodied in our Constitution.  All that the Educate Together movement is asking is to be treated equally with other providers of post-primary education.  Its track record is proven and it provides a service.  It cannot cope with the demand for places coming from parents who no longer necessarily want to bring their children up in the traditional religion in which they were brought up.  They may want diversity of exposure, even if they adhere to their own religious convictions or have converted to other religious convictions.  They want, uniquely, to have their children brought up in a culture that respects and tolerates all faiths on an equal basis.  For that reason, they are seeking to have this introduced to the secondary level and the Educate Together movement is seeking to be formally recognised as a patron by the Department of Education and Science.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_1318">I am just making that clear.  I will seek responses to the questions asked by the Deputy and get them back to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the current issues surrounding recognition and patronage in general and the position regarding the request from Educate Together to become a patron of second level schools in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">The Department is currently examining the application from Educate Together in the context of second level education, the Education Act and the Department of Education and Science regulations on patronage at second level.  Section 6 of the Education Act 1998 sets out the objectives of the Act, one of which is "to promote the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources".  The Act also sets out the functions of the Minister.  Section 7(4) states, "In carrying out his or her functions, the Minister shall have regard to the resources available and the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State."</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">In recent times, the rapid pace of social and demographic change in Ireland is reflected in a radically altered and more diverse society from which our school communities are drawn.  Added to this, it is expected that enrolments at second level will increase significantly from the 2007 enrolment of 335,126 pupils.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new model of primary school patronage is currently being piloted in response to changing societal circumstances.  The pilot primary community schools, which opened in September 2008 and which come under the patronage of County Dublin VEC, aim to provide education for diverse denominational groups, reflecting parental choice and based on an ethos of inclusion and respect for children of all faiths and none.  This new primary model provides a valuable new option in ensuring that our school system is responsive to parental choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">In ensuring that the range of patronage models, new and existing, collectively achieve this, it is important to build on ongoing dialogue with the education partners in encouraging a wider public discussion of the issues involved.  In this context, the Minister recently announced a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.  He has established a technical working group under the commission to undertake a full review of the criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools.  This working group has commenced its work and will report to the steering group under the Commission on School Accommodation.  It is expected that the review of procedures for recognising primary schools will be completed and that revised arrangements will be in place within a two-year timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">In the interim, it is not proposed to recognise any new schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons not related to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.  It is proposed that locations where new schools are required for the coming years will be identified by the Department of Education and Science and the details will be circulated to all existing patron bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">In light of our increasing student population and moves towards diversity in education it is also timely to examine the broad issues of patronage at second level.  The Department is, therefore, considering a number of issues relating to the recognition process for second level schools.  The application from Educate Together to become a patron body at second level will be considered within this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">I will ask the Department to correspond directly with Deputy Quinn in respect of the specific matters he raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1327">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise the matter of St. Joseph's centre for the visually impaired, Gracepark Road, Drumcondra, Dublin 9 and its efforts to build a new centre of excellence to provide visually impaired people with appropriate accommodation in respect of the current and future delivery of services.  I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to support this project and to use the recession as a reason to build the centre and provide jobs and investment on the north side of Dublin, particularly in the constituency of Dublin North-Central.  This project is worth €40 million and represents a glorious opportunity.  Damian O'Farrell, who is standing as an Independent candidate in the local elections, also wants these services for the visually impaired to be provided in our area and is fighting to ensure that this proves to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">St. Joseph's currently provides education and health care services to all children in the State who are blind and partially sighted.  Increasingly, it is working with children who also have multiple disabilities in addition to their visual impairments.  In recent years, St. Joseph's has moved to provide, in addition to schooling, early intervention, assessments, preschool, vision-clinic services, primary and secondary education, recreation and sports activities and vocational training.  This is supported by a residential provision, both on and off campus, which encourages children who attend St. Joseph's to be more independent.  In addition, it operates a large print and Braille production centre, which provides classroom textbooks for all children in mainstream schools.  Further, it continually trains and works with professionals and parents who are in direct contact with children with a visual impairment throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">This is a radical and exciting new project and has huge potential.  I am aware that the Department of Education and Science is interested in it.  I urge the Minister of State, who has a strong interest in and supports people with disabilities, to take the lead in respect of this matter.  It is time to support St. Joseph's.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">When one considers the services currently on offer, one is very impressed.  For example, the assessment service offers a multidisciplinary process through which the needs and abilities of a child or young person with a significant sight loss can be identified.  This service is the starting point for making recommendations with regard to which interventions best enable each child to reach his or her individual potential.  The preschool and early intervention service provides specialised support and skills to children, from birth to six years, in partnership with their families.  It also offers a holistic approach to the education of young children, as well as support, information and guidance to families and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">St. Joseph's also provides primary and secondary education.  The primary school is inclusive in nature, with pupils following a broad and balanced curriculum and where all children are given opportunities to participate in a wide range of learning activities.  The secondary school is situated adjacent to the St. Joseph's campus and students who are visually impaired and sighted are educated together there.  The school offers a wide range of academic and practical subjects.  The staff includes six dedicated teachers for the visually impaired.  These people work and provide a service in the public sector.  It may not be trendy or fashionable to praise public sector workers at present but I take this opportunity to do so once again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">St. Joseph's also provides vocational training.  Its vocational training programme is designed to meet the particular needs of young adults of 16 years and older who have a visual impairment.  These individuals are likely to have recently completed the special education cycle in secondary school and have an additional disability or special needs arising from a developmental delay and also needs relating to their independence, social and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">The family resource centre, FRC, at St. Joseph's offers an extensive outreach programme to young people with a visual impairment and their families.  The service is accessed through a yearly calendar of events and is open to all visually impaired children, from birth to early adulthood, throughout Ireland.  The FRC caters not only for children with a visual impairment but also for those with additional disabilities.  It hosts a variety of events — training days, seminars, exhibitions and information, advice and discussion groups — for the families of these children in these groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">I urge the Minister for Education and Science to meet the project team from St. Joseph's and to strongly support the new centre of excellence for the visually impaired, which is essential for many people.  I urge that there be movement, that action be taken and, above all, that a common-sense approach be adopted.  I support St. Joseph's.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_1335">I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for raising this matter and apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who could not be present.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to clarify the position regarding the proposed centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">The Deputy may be aware that a decision was taken in 2003 that the centre as originally proposed should not proceed, having regard to the low and declining pupil numbers in the school for the visually impaired and the development costs involved, estimated to be in excess of €30 million.  A scaled down version of a national centre was subsequently proposed, to be staffed by a range of professionals, including expert in-house assessment such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, mobility therapy and ophthalmology as well as counselling, pre-school and outreach support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">The Deputy will also be aware that in the context of inclusive education, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides that a child, defined as a person who is not more than 18 years, with special educational needs must be educated in an inclusive setting unless such an arrangement is inconsistent with the best interests of the child or with the effective provision of education for those children with whom the child is to be educated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">In the past, children who were blind or had a visual impairment were unable to attend their local schools and had to travel distances to avail of specialised intervention.  Today, many of these children attend their local schools with additional special educational supports, where necessary.  My Department, through the NCSE, funds additional teaching and special needs assistant support for these pupils where such additional supports are necessary.  In addition, funding is provided for specialist equipment and-or assistive technology.  My Department also funds the National Braille Production Centre which translates textbooks into Braille, large print and other formats.  Current policy and best practice in regard to health service delivery for blind and visually impaired pupils is that they remain and are supported in their local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">As the Minister indicated in his response to the Deputy's parliamentary question on 27 January, he met with representatives from St. Joseph's school recently and a further meeting is being arranged to discuss the matter.  The Minister advised the delegation that his Department is willing to work with St. Joseph's school in the context of identifying any upgrading work required to the school that is consistent with the use of the premises for educational purposes.  Any refurbishments will be considered in a prioritised manner.  As in all other areas of expenditure, the timing of these refurbishments is dependent on the resources available to the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">The Minister is pleased to inform the Deputy that he confirmed to representatives of the school that his Department will provide a grant of €12,000 to St. Joseph's school towards the costs of its hosting the seventh European conference of the International Council for the Education of People with Visual Impairment next July.  This grant was furnished to St. Joseph's last December.  On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputy McGrath for his ongoing interest in this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1342">I refer to the reply to Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for the State.  In 2008, the Agency purchased some 3.5m certified emission reduction units at a cost of €53m; these units were generated under the Clean Development Mechanism provided for in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol.  Further purchases of these type of units for Kyoto Protocol compliance purposes in the commitment period 2008-2012 is a matter for the Agency in accordance with the purchasing framework set out in Annex III to the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012.  However, they may be influenced by any international emissions trading agreement which the Government may enter into under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol and my Department is liaising with the Agency on prospect of such a trading agreement or agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">Prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent, my Department committed €10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank.  Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and, since enactment of the 2007 Act, payments are made through the Carbon Fund process as they arise. In 2008, my Department refunded €3.72m to the Carbon Fund in respect of these investments in the World Bank in 2007.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1349">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 43 and 213 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">Blanket Bogs and Raised bogs are important natural habitats and are home to unique ecosystems containing rare flora and fauna. Both are protected habitats under European and Irish Law and representative samples have been designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the Habitats Directive or Natural Heritage Areas (NHA) under the Wildlife Acts. Ireland has some of the most ecologically important bogs in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">In 1999, when the first of these sites were designated for nature protection all commercial cutting on these bogs was stopped and the then Minister granted a 10 year grace period for those who were cutting turf for their personal domestic use to find alternative sources of fuel. This 10 year period expires this year for 32 raised bog SACs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">Blanket bogs, which occur predominantly on the Western seaboard but also in Wicklow and the midlands, can tolerate a certain amount of turf extraction without compromising their value as habitats and it is envisaged that cutting on Blanket Bog SAC's can continue, except in very sensitive areas, under the current restrictions, which prohibits commercial extraction and the use of "sausage" machines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">Raised bogs occur predominantly in the midlands. There are over 1,500 raised bogs in the State and only 139 of these are designated for nature protection as SACs or NHAs. The continued cutting of turf, by hand or machine, and associated drainage on these designated raised bogs is incompatible with their preservation. Even with the restricted cutting that was introduced in 1999, over one third of the best bog habitat on these sites has been lost in ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">There is a legal obligation on the State to take measures to ensure the protection of this essential and irreplaceable part of our natural heritage. Therefore, in the light of the scientific evidence, it would not be appropriate to grant an extension to the derogation in these areas.  I will shortly bring a proposal to Government with a view to putting arrangements in place to facilitate the transition to a full cessation of turf cutting on 32 raised bogs by the end of 2009, and to the remaining number of designated bogs in 2012 and 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">There has been no discussion about the use of hopper machines — the use of such machines is permitted wherever turf cutting is permitted. The use of "sausage" machines is not permitted on designated bogs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1357">As signalled by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2009, a new single streamlined Government Equity Scheme is to be introduced in relation to affordable housing.  Under this new arrangement the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective.  However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing claw-back, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold.  The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the remaining equity in steps or at the end of a fixed period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">Initially, I intend to apply the equity arrangement to affordable housing delivered under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2007, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative, once the details have been finalised and the necessary legislative provision has been introduced through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2008.   The issue of introducing an open market component of the scheme will be kept under review in light of developments in the housing market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">These new arrangements will introduce greater equity into the system, provide greater protection of the State's investment and achieve better value for money as funds can be recycled into assisting further households with affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">Full information on the revised arrangements will be made available prior to their commencement. In the interim, the existing arrangements for the sale of affordable housing continue to apply.  Prospective applicants for affordable homes should apply in the normal way to the local authority or local authorities in the areas in which they are interested in purchasing.</p>

My Department is in discussions in this regard with the Department of Finance, which has overall responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act and its extension to further bodies.  At this stage, it is intended that the matter will be progressed in the context of proposals to be brought forward later in the year by the Department of Finance for the extension of the Freedom of Information Acts to a number of additional public bodies.

            <p eId="para_1378">In order to encourage the development of a competitive cost environment, and in line with other EU Member States, no standard fee for Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments has been set.  There are currently almost 1,700 BER assessors registered with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) and this number is expected to grow, given that over 4,800 persons have successfully completed training.  The conditions for a healthy competitive market for this service, are, therefore, in place and a downward pressure on the cost of BER assessments is already evident.  As with all services, home owners are advised to shop around for the best deal available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">In relation to recent media reports of inconsistent ratings, the position is that, when a registered BER assessor completes an assessment on a property, he/she is required to lodge the relevant data on SEI's National Administration System (NAS).  The NAS undertakes detailed validation checks on each BER assessment received and can query an assessor in relation to any irregular data submitted.  This is an essential safeguard in a complex process where the potential for human error can exist. I am informed by SEI that the assessments in question were not lodged on the NAS and do not constitute official BER results.  All BER assessment activity is closely monitored by SEI and a robust system of audit and quality assurance checks is in place.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1384">I propose to take Question Nos. 21, 25, 27 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">On 30 June 2008, Councillors Dessie Larkin and Vincent P. Martin were appointed as members of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) for the period up to 31 December 2012.  Subsequently, the Board appointed both members to its Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC), consistent with its general policy of appointing all Board members to the DRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">However, on 12 September 2008, it was brought to my Department's attention that section 169 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 precludes members of local authorities from membership of the Board. Therefore the appointments of Councillors Larkin and Martin to the Board were invalid.  Following the matter being brought to notice, my Department acted immediately, contacting both individuals concerned and explaining that their ineligibility for appointment to the Board had been mistakenly overlooked by my Department at the time of their appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">As I indicated to the House when this matter arose on the Adjournment on 9 October 2008, neither individual had participated in any Tenancy Tribunals drawn from the membership of the DRC.  While they had attended five Board meetings at which Tenancy Tribunal cases were discussed, all decisions at those meetings were taken by consensus and with an attendance well in excess of the quorum of five.  Nevertheless, in the interests of legal certainty, the Board reconsidered all decisions taken at those meetings at a Board meeting on 19 September 2008 and fresh determination orders and decisions were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The separate issue which gave rise to the enactment last week of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2009 concerned a procedural error by the Board of the PRTB in making appointments to its Dispute Resolution Committee.  While section 159(3) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 requires that a member of the Board must have at least three years remaining in their Board term of office to be appointed to the Committee, it emerged in December 2008 that this requirement had not been complied with in the case of a number of DRC appointments made by the Board.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2009 enacted last week has regularised this deficiency and the individuals concerned will now continue to be members of the DRC for the period specified by the Board when making the appointments, even where this extends beyond their term of Board membership.  In the absence of documentary evidence that the requirements of section 159 in relation to consultation with the Minister regarding appointments to the DRC had been complied with by the Board, the legislation also addressed this issue, for the avoidance of any doubt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">The issue which ultimately gave rise to the legislation enacted last week was identified within the PRTB on 9 December 2008 and my Department was advised informally the following day of the fact that there was a potential difficulty, at which point the PRTB sought legal advice on the matter.  On foot of the legal advice received, the Board indicated to my Department on 19 December 2008 that it would be submitting a written request for the introduction of legislation to regularise the situation.  Minister Gormley was advised of the matter on that date and it was brought to my attention on my return to the office on Monday 22 December 2008, on which date the formal request from the PRTB was received.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Given the time, effort and cost expended by the PRTB in convening the Tribunals involved, and given that the professionalism and procedures of the Tribunals were not in any doubt, it was considered that neither landlords, tenants nor the taxpayer would be well served by potentially adding further to the PRTB caseload and that emergency legislation of the kind sought by the Board should be introduced to address the situation. The matter was immediately taken up with the Office of the Attorney General, culminating in the introduction of the legislation on the first day of the new Dáil term on 27 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">While the legislation regularises the appointments concerned, it does not amend the terms of section 159 of the 2004 Act.  Accordingly, the requirements of section 159 continue to apply to all future DRC appointments.  My Department has written to the PRTB in this regard, emphasising the need for absolute diligence by the Board in ensuring future compliance with the requirements of section 159 and all other provisions of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">When the issue in relation to the DRC appointments was brought to attention in December 2008, my Department requested the PRTB to urgently commission an external audit to check compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 with regard to governance and legal structures, appointment of Board members and Committee members and any other relevant aspects relating to the governance provisions of the Act.  This compliance audit was completed in January 2009 and has identified no similar issues requiring legislative correction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">Finally, it should be noted that I have requested my Department to undertake a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the PRTB operates.  The purpose of this review, which will get underway shortly, is to consider whether, in light of more than four years' operational experience, the PRTB's underpinning legislative framework can be improved in order to further support the effective regulation of a healthy and well-functioning private rental sector.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1401">There are two basic elements in the planning system — the determination of planning applications by planning authorities, and the determination by An Bord Pleanála of planning appeals and other matters referred to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">There were an unprecedented 92,650 planning applications in 2006, and some 86,800 in 2007.  These levels of activity clearly had implications for the operation of the planning system.  Available data indicate that in 2007, about 64% of decisions on planning applications were made within the statutory 8 week period, further information was sought in 32% of cases, and an extension of time was agreed with the applicant in nearly 3% of cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">The number of planning applications in 2008 fell by some 30% to about 61,000 and is expected to fall further during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">As an independent planning appeals body, An Bord Pleanála has a key role in ensuring that physical developments, in particular major infrastructure projects, respect the principles of sustainable development and are planned in an efficient, fair and open manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">Under Section 126 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Board has a statutory objective to determine appeals within 18 weeks.  Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of delays arising from the holding of an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Record levels of case intake over successive years, peaking at nearly 6,700 cases in 2007, have challenged An Bord Pleanála's ability to achieve this statutory objective. According to the Board's annual report for 2007, the 18-week statutory objective was met in 48% of all cases, compared to 52% in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">The Board has also assumed significant new functions under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006. This necessitated a review of the Board's operations and significant restructuring leading to the establishment of a dedicated Strategic Infrastructure Division within the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">In light of the demands imposed by its heavy caseload and these additional functions, sanction was given in 2007 for an additional 35.5 permanent staff, bring the total complement to 172.  Board membership has also been increased from 10 to 11, on a temporary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The Board is focused on dealing quickly with the current backlog of cases and restoring compliance with its statutory objective of determining appeals and referrals within a period of 18 weeks, and expects to make significant progress in this regard over 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">I am considering legislative change, in the context of the proposed Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, to facilitate greater overall efficiency in the determination of cases by the Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials (such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments and stationery) has been a matter for the Returning Officers, who are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to them in relation to the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment.  Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment (including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating) for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were some €658,000; €696,000; €706,000; €489,000; and €204,000, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines (some 4,762 in total) were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are some €328,000.  These are largely one-off costs related to the preparation of the facility, transportation of the machines and the acquisition of storage containers.  The available capacity at this location has now been fully utilised.  A total of 2,729 voting machines are stored locally by Returning Officers at thirteen locations throughout the country; a further thirteen machines are stored in the Custom House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I am aware of the issues that have been raised in relation to storage arrangements for the machines.  On this matter, the Government decision to proceed with the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised premises was the right approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in relation to the electronic voting and counting project. In this, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the Programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner. It is important that we come to the best possible decision.  It is not possible to make more specific comment at this point on the project itself, or on future plans for the machines, pending the necessary work and a decision by Government in the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1441">Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in variable amounts in rocks and soil. When it surfaces in the open air, it is quickly diluted.  However, where it enters an enclosed space, such as an ordinary building, it can, under certain circumstances accumulate to reach unacceptably high concentration levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">Radon is a known carcinogen and contributes to the incidence of lung cancer.  This risk is especially significant for smokers. Long term exposure to high radon levels presents a direct risk to human health.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">The Government's approach to radon is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. This is similar to the approach adopted in the majority of EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">In addition, my Department has recently established a multi-agency group to examine the issue further and to engage closely with local authorities in determining the best approach to addressing any radon protection deficits in local authority housing stock.  Discussions are ongoing, and guidance will be made available in due course.  However, it should be noted that a number of local authorities, in Cork, Clare, Kerry, Tipperary, and Waterford have already undertaken radon testing and remediation action, where necessary, in their housing stock.  My Department continues to support the efforts of such authorities under their annual improvement works programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 42 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">I am committed to putting in place the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the EU landfill diversion targets that will apply from 2010 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Following extensive consultation, the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and is aimed at diverting 80% of biodegradable waste from landfill through segregated collection and the generation of compost.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to implementation of the National Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">The projections for 2016, are based on the provision by then of alternative treatment facilities on the necessary scale, and relevant issues in that regard are being examined in depth in the International Waste Review currently under way.  The initial targets under the Landfill Directive are more immediate as they relate to 2010 and the existing measures under the Biowaste Strategy are designed to achieve these targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">I have also indicated my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow significant increases in the landfill levy and a Regulatory Impact Analysis for this purpose has been completed.  My Department, in addition, is working with industry towards the development of a Statutory Instrument for the segregation of commercial biodegradable waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The National Waste Report 2007 states that the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled continued to increase to 1,485,968 tonnes in 2007.  I am concerned at our progress towards meeting targets for the diversion of this material.  Last year, I issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the report indicates progress in relation to home composting.  I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the attainment of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill.</p>

Eunomia Research and Consulting Ltd. (and partners) were selected to undertake the study, the scope of which will underpin the overall review as provided for in the programme for Government.

The level of material on hand, arising from the current difficulties in global markets for recyclates, has declined significantly as a result of markets reopening.  Therefore, finding markets for the full recycling of material on hand remains the preferred solution.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1472">I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed by regulations made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both, and €250 for each day of a continuing offence.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">In the partnership agreement Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating and more effectively enforcing the minimum standards regulations and recently delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures.  A number of elements of this package require amendments of primary legislation and these are being addressed during the passage, through the Oireachtas, of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  These include increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Those elements of the package not requiring primary legislation have been introduced through new regulations to update the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993.  The new regulations, entitled the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, were made by me on 10 December 2008 and notice of the making of these regulations was published in Iris Oifigiúil on 16 December 2008.  Copies of the regulations are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  Copies of the regulations have also been provided to various sectoral interests, including landlord and tenant representative bodies.  In addition, the coming into effect of the regulations was advertised in the print media on Monday 26 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 came into effect generally on 1 February 2009.  From that date, any rental properties being let for the first time will have to comply with all the requirements of the new Regulations.  However, taking account of views expressed in wide-ranging consultations during the development of the new standards package, certain provisions of the new regulations will not come into effect for existing rental accommodation until 1 February 2013 as it will be necessary to allow time for the carrying out of the significant remedial work that may be involved in achieving compliance.  Accordingly, in so far as existing rental accommodation is concerned, the issues covered by those provisions — sanitary facilities, heating facilities and food preparation and storage and laundry — will continue to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993 until then.  Existing rental accommodation is defined in the regulations as a house let for rent or other valuable consideration solely as a dwelling at any time from 1 September 2004 to 31 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Responsibility for enforcing the regulations with regard to minimum standards for rental accommodation rests with the relevant local authority.  My Department provides significant resources, from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, to assist local authorities in discharging their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation.  Over €3m was provided for this purpose in 2007, with a further €4m earmarked for 2008.  In addition, a Technical Guidance Document has been prepared and copies have been provided to local authorities in order to assist with the practical implementation of the regulations; the guidance document is also available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy, inspection arrangements and methods for establishing compliance.  However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to Good Practice in Housing Management: Guidelines for Local Authorities Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on relevant issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1514">In response to the Programme for Government and the National Climate Change Strategy commitments, I have developed the principles of a scheme to offset greenhouse gas emissions from official air travel by Ministers and civil servants.

            <p eId="para_1515">The scheme will operate on an annual basis, starting in 2009 and will retrospectively account for all official air travel since the Government came into office in June 2007.  All Departments have been notified of the key elements of the scheme and they will be required each year to calculate their carbon dioxide emissions and associated offsetting costs based on total air kilometres travelled.  My Department will provide a carbon price each year to reflect the average price in the voluntary offsetting market as the basis for Departments to calculate their offsetting costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">The value of the total offsetting requirements for Departments will be invested on behalf of Ireland by the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) in small scale "gold standard" energy efficiency and renewable energy offsetting projects in Ireland's priority Oversees Development Aid countries in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">The scheme will apply to all Government Departments and Offices, and will cover all flights by Ministers and officials on both commercial airlines and Government passenger aircraft.

            <p eId="para_1520">It is a feature of the operation of the affordable housing schemes that individual authorities ordinarily have a certain quantum of completed affordable homes on hands at any given time, principally comprising units either being prepared for, or in the course of, sale.  However, the information available from local authorities would suggest that the strong level of affordable housing delivery in 2008 and wider housing and mortgage market considerations are combining to increase the stock of homes on hands.  The indications to date are that the number of affordable units on hands nationally is in the region of 2,500 to 3,000 units.  Given that the length of time between the acquisition and subsequent sale of affordable homes varies from case to case, it is not feasible to estimate the associated financing costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">My Department has requested the Affordable Homes Partnership to examine the position in selected areas, in conjunction with the relevant housing authorities, with a view to identifying actions that might assist in the sale of such units.

Further guidance will be issued to local authorities by my Department and by the AHP in the coming weeks.</p>

The strategy contained specific commitments for local authorities and delivering on these commitments is primarily a matter for them.  A number of local authorities have already published their own climate change strategies and my Department is working closely with authorities to ensure a co-ordinated approach to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_630">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1557">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">State development agencies supporting enterprise development in County Donegal and which operate under my aegis are IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Donegal County Enterprise Board.  The training agency FÁS is also under my aegis and plays a major role in the training and upskilling of workers in enterprises.  Údarás na Gaeltachta and other agencies operate under the aegis of other Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">In 2008 Donegal CEB received a Capital Allocation of €821,093 of which €471,627.00 was used to deliver a range of management capability development programmes, and €349,466.00 was used in direct grant assistance, resulting in the creation of 187 jobs in the area.  The role of Donegal County Enterprise Board, as one of the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards nationwide, is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">Donegal is a target location for IDA with the County now competing for a different type of business to the labour intensive manufacturing which we so successfully won over the past four decades.  The overseas investor is now seeking locations for more advanced manufacturing or office based solutions, to a great extent depending on high skill and doing high value work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">To encourage this interest IDA has developed a new modern Business Park in Letterkenny with modern building solutions capable of competing with other locations nationally and also internationally.  IDA has been working with the 3rd Level Sector in the region at Letterkenny Institute of Technology and the 3rd Level sector in Northern Ireland to offer the necessary courses aimed at our target sectors of Medical Technologies, International and Financial Services and High End Engineering.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">As regards Enterprise Ireland, its activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports for high potential start up companies including, financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc.  Two HPSU's were created in Donegal in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">In 2008, under the 2007-2009 Community Enterprise Centre Scheme, Milford &amp; District Resource Ltd. were approved funding of €500,000 towards a new Community Enterprise Centre in Milford, Co. Donegal and €50,000 funding for a Business Development Manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">While recognising that there are currently employment difficulties in Donegal, as there is across the State, it is of major significance that while jobs are being lost, jobs are also being created as is clearly demonstrated by the Agency statistics above.  The role of the State development agencies has been, and will continue to be, critical in supporting both the maintenance of enterprises and the creation of enterprises.  I have full confidence in their ability to do so in County Donegal into the future. The number of jobs created in Donegal by IDA Ireland grant aided companies are as follows:</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_631">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1617">I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 72 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">I have no role in the day-to-day operation of individual companies, and as such have not met with staff or management of the company concerned.  However, I understand that the Tánaiste has received representations on the matter and that the Department raised the matter with Enterprise Ireland, who have a relationship with, and have provided support to, the company.  Enterprise Ireland, in turn, has been in contact with the company and has advised that, as the company is now in breach of its grant aid agreements, they have formally revoked and are seeking recovery of grants paid to the company and have cancelled unpaid grant aid not yet drawn down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy, there are a number of different aspects that arise and these are dealt with separately as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">Redundancies</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">Section 11 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides that the following two conditions must apply for a cessation of work to be regarded as a lay off:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1622">First, that it is reasonable in the circumstances for the employer to believe that the cessation of employment will not be permanent, and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1623">Second, that the employer gives notice to that effect to the employee prior to the cessation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">Under the legislation, if a lay off exceeds 4 weeks, it is open to an employee to seek a determination that in fact a redundancy has taken place.  In situations where there is a dispute about whether or not a redundancy has taken place, or where the employer is simply silent on the subject, the matter may be referred — by an employee, a group of employees, or their representatives (e.g. a trade union) to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for a determination.  It would be open to an employer to appeal a determination of the EAT within 21 days to the High Court.  Officials in my Department have advised staff of the Company of the availability of this option.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">If the EAT determines that a redundancy has taken place — and if there is no appeal or an appeal fails — and if the company refuses to pay or is not in a position to pay redundancy entitlements, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment can at that stage pay the employee(s) their minimum statutory redundancy entitlements in full.  The Department will then follow up with the employer to recover that element of the payment, which the State is entitled to get back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">Payment of wages</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">The Deputy also raised the matter of outstanding wages and holiday pay. Section 5(6) of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, states that the non-payment of wages properly payable by an employer on any occasion will be regarded as an unlawful deduction of wages. Employees may bring complaints in relation to matters under this legislation to the Rights Commissioner Service and staff have been advised accordingly.  If a Rights Commissioner decides that the complaint is valid, an employer can be ordered to pay compensation.  The employer can appeal the decision of the Rights Commissioner to the Employment Appeals Tribunal within 6 weeks. If a decision of the Rights Commissioner is not appealed or the appeal fails and the decision is not enforced by the due date by the employer, the employee(s) affected may enforce the decision or determination through an Order of the Circuit Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Insolvent company</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">The Insolvency Payments Scheme, operated under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, and administered by my Department, provides for the payment of certain wage-related entitlements where an employee's employment is terminated as a result of the employer's insolvency.  In addition to minimum statutory redundancy entitlements, payments can also be made in respect of arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay, minimum notice, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">However, claims under the Scheme can only be processed if a company is legally insolvent within the definition of the Act and a "relevant officer" — normally a receiver or liquidator — has been appointed.  Relevant Officers can submit a certified claim on behalf of employees on statutory forms, which are available from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">As the Deputy is aware, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which is responsible for monitoring compliance with Employment Rights Legislation, can provide additional information on employment rights obligations and entitlements. NERA can be contacted by telephone on 1890 80 80 90 (Lo call) while the Authority's website, www.employmentrights.ie, could also be usefully consulted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1633">I understand from Enterprise Ireland that Enterprise Castlerea was approved support of €350,000 by the agency for the Centre in question under the Community Enterprise Centre (CEC) Scheme in 2006.  However, due to a delay in the transfer of a site from IDA Ireland to Roscommon County Council, a time extension to commence construction of the Centre was granted to the company on 24 March 2008.  The time extension was to December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">In December 2008, Enterprise Castlerea contacted Enterprise Ireland with an alternative proposal to the construction of the Centre.  This proposal is for the purchase of a 30,000 sq. ft. building to be converted into enterprise units.  The agency met with Enterprise Castlerea and requested that updated information be submitted in support of the new proposal.  To date, only basic information has been submitted by Enterprise Castlerea about this alternative proposal.  Additional information is necessary to form the basis of a recommendation to the relevant decision making Board within Enterprise Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1676">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue's Border Midlands West Region has the largest geographical spread of all Revenue regions.  The number of small offices located in this region is a legacy of the prior existence of Customs and Excise stations which, since 1993, are no longer needed in the context of the Single Market.  Generally, only limited services are delivered from these small offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">The functions carried out in the Lifford office have been reviewed and it has been established that there is an overriding business case to integrate these functions into other nearby Revenue locations in Co. Donegal.  This position is made more urgent by the condition of the building in Lifford.  The structure has serious health and safety issues and would, in any event, require total rebuilding in a different location.  The decision has therefore been taken that the reasonable option is to close Lifford and to move the functions elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) functions are moving from Lifford to Donegal Town with effect from Monday 16th February. Revenue's on-line facilities (ROS) have greatly reduced the demand for service at their Vehicle Registration Offices. All new vehicles can be registered using ROS. Indeed, each of the main dealers in Co. Donegal currently uses ROS for this purpose.  No attendance at a Vehicle Registration Office (VRO) is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">In addition, a valuation enquiry facility is available on the Revenue website, allowing all customers to obtain VRT quotations for second-hand vehicles on-line. The registration process for second-hand vehicles has been simplified and it is no longer necessary to physically examine all such vehicles as had been the case previously.  There is also a facility for Customers to register vehicles by post without the need to bring their vehicles to a Revenue office.  These initiatives have greatly assisted the successful consolidation of vehicle registration services into the larger Revenue centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">In order to register a vehicle on-line, the VRT must be paid at the time of registration. A deferred payment or FACT (Flexible Accounting of Cash Transactions) facility is available to dealers for this purpose. The deferred payment account is maintained by the dealers in their own bank. The FACT account is a payment account maintained with Revenue. Amounts due in respect of VRT are debited automatically from those accounts at the time of vehicle registration. Lodgements can be made by dealers to their FACT accounts by cheques presented in person or received by post at the VRO. Electronic funds transfer is another method by which dealers can lodge money to their FACT accounts.  Staff at the VRO are available to assist members of the motor trade in arranging the payment method best suited to their business requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">Based on service demands, the alternatives available and the need for Revenue to make effective use of resources, the consolidation of vehicle registration services into Donegal town is reasonable and will not cause undue difficulty for Customers in the county.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
            <p eId="para_1687">The Commissioners of Public Works are already addressing the issue of flooding at various locations throughout the country. Following a Government Decision in September 2004, the Commissioners have responsibility as lead agency for implementing Government policy in relation to flooding, now including coastal flooding, which was previously the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The Commissioners have already completed a number of schemes to defend areas at risk from flooding. Major projects completed include, the River Nore [Kilkenny], the River Suir [Carrick-on-Suir] the River Tolka in Counties Meath, Fingal and Dublin City. Other areas where schemes are completed are Dunmanway, Sixmilebridge, Duleek, the River Mulkear at Newport and Cappamore, Lacken [Ardrahan], Kinvara and Maam Valley Co. Galway, Bridgend, Co Donegal, Shinkeen Stream [Hazelhatch], Morrel River and Lyreen Meadowbrook Rivers, Co Kildare, Drumcollogher, Co. Limerick, Clancy's Strand and Harry's Mall in Limerick City, Avoca, Aughrim and Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, Athlone Co Westmeath, Freemount Co. Cork, Scotch Quay, Waterford City, and Mullinahone, Co Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Flood Relief Schemes are currently underway in Ennis, Clonmel, Leixlip Lower Dodder and Mallow.  I expect schemes to commence within the next few months in Carlow, Fermoy Tullamore, Mornington and Waterford. A scheme to protect Templemore has just been put on statutory public display, and, subject to successful completion of the confirmation process, I expect work to commence on that scheme later this year. The statutory public exhibition of a scheme for Enniscorthy will commence on 17 February.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">A scheme has been designed in co-operation with Bray Town Council, to protect Bray and I expect tenders for that scheme will be invited this year. OPW is working with Arklow Town Council to prepare a scheme to protect the town. A scheme has also been designed for Portarlington and OPW is in consultation with Laois and Offaly County Councils with a view to advancing that scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">OPW is also working with a number of Local Authorities with a view to identifying solutions to local flooding problems in their areas. OPW will support the implementation of protective measures that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">In addition to the provision of structural defences for towns, that have existing flood risk, OPW is also working with other Departments and Agencies, where appropriate, to address flood risk and prevent the creation of future risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">A Flood Hazard maps website, which records available historic data on areas which have flooded or are known to be at risk, has been established. A programme of Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Studies has commenced, which will produce predictive flood hazard and risk maps and risk management plans for areas which are considered on the basis of available or readily derivable information to have a significant flood risk. Studies are currently in progress for the rivers Lee, Suir and Dodder catchments and the Fingal/East Meath Hydrometric Area. Studies of all river catchments will be completed over the next five to six years. Information generated as the studies proceed, including hazard maps and risk maps will be made available to the public as it comes to hand. The Commissioners of Public Works will as far as possible prioritise the studies in the areas where development plans are due for review, in order to ensure the best possible flow of relevant information to planners. These studies will meet the requirements of the EU Floods Directive. OPW represented Ireland at the negotiation of the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">OPW in co-operation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government have prepared Guidelines on the Management of Flood Risk in the Planning and Development System. The guidelines were published for consultation last September. It is intended that, when the consultation process is complete the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will issue directions on their application to Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">OPW has also taken steps to raise public awareness of flood risk as an important issue, through media campaigns and the establishment of a website which gives advice on mitigating some of the impact of flooding through preparation and planning, and also contains information on flood protection products. OPW is also considering the possibility of improving the quality of warnings of coastal and river flooding, in conjunction with other agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1697">In the context of the difficulties in international financial markets which developed in August 2007 and continued thereafter it was prudent to prepare contingency legislative provisions to address scenarios that might develop.  The preparation of contingency legislative provisions to nationalise a credit institution consequently formed an important part of the planning work undertaken by my Department.  Financial stability contingency planning intensified during September 2008 when the extent and intensity of the upheavals in international financial markets deepened. The contingency legislative provisions available to the Government when the guarantee was announced did not relate to any specific credit institution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1798">The position is that there is an exemption from the income levy for any person who is aged 65 years or over whose income for a year does not exceed €20,000.  Where the individual is married and the joint income of the couple for the year is less than €40,000, then a joint exemption of up to €40,000 applies.  In addition, an exemption from the income levy also applies for persons who are in receipt of a full medical card.  It would appear from the information available to Revenue that one of the individuals whose details have been supplied is aged over 65 years and as such may be able to avail of the exemption provided for in legislation, subject to their personal income being less than the exemption threshold of €20,000, or where the individual is married, to the joint exemption of €40,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1799">If no exemption applies, the income levy is charged, on an individual basis, where an individual's aggregate income exceeds €18,304, at the rate of 1 per cent in respect of aggregate income up to a limit of €100,100, with a rate of 2 per cent applying to income in excess of that ceiling but not greater than €250,120, and a rate of 3 per cent applying on the balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_2065">Because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers, a figure for the highest amount of relief claimed under the various property based schemes is not provided in relation to individual amounts exceeding €1 million. This is due to the small numbers of returns with amounts exceeding that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">I am advised by Revenue that they are not in a position to provide data for 2007 and 2008 as the tax returns for those years are either being processed currently or are not yet due.  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax foregone at the 42% rate in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies.  The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.  The highest and lowest tax reliefs shown have also been calculated on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">As regards the mid-Shannon scheme which commenced in June 2008, complete data will not be available until all of the relevant tax returns for 2009 are filed and processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11.  The non inclusion of form 12 data for the schemes which provide relief for  residential owner occupiers such as the Rural Renewal, Urban Renewal, Town Renewal, Park and Ride and the Living over the Shop Schemes  may well mean that the actual number of claimants in each of these schemes could exceed the numbers  indicated with a consequential lowering of the  actual average tax cost per claimant.</p>

            <p eId="para_2072">As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out into the current regime of tax incentives for supplementary pension provision.  This was done with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. Arising from the review, the following revised and up-to-date estimates of the cost of tax and other reliefs for private pension provision for 2006 have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">Corresponding estimates are also provided for 2005 to the extent that it has been possible to update them on a consistent basis.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide data for 2007 and 2008 as the tax returns for those years are either being processed currently or not yet due.</p>

This information is set out in the following tables which provide the number of cases as well as amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs for the various contribution ranges.

            <p eId="para_2271">Under the provisions of Section 20 of the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009, I as Minister for Finance or my nominee appointed under the Act, may with the consent of the Central Bank appoint directors, other officers and employees to Anglo Irish Bank.  Any such appointees shall hold office for such duration and upon such terms and conditions as I or my nominee may determine.  My functions under this section of the Act may be exercised only in the public interest and subject to regulatory requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">As I announced on 20th January in my speech on the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill, the day-to-day running of Anglo Irish Bank will continue as normal and will be managed on a commercial basis at arms length from the Government.  Therefore matters in relation to remuneration of directors and staff at Anglo Irish Bank will continue to be determined in the normal way at the bank unless I decide to exercise my functions under Section 20 of the Act and in which case terms and conditions including remuneration will be set in accordance with advice from my officials, and having consulted with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">The Deputy will be aware of the existence of the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC) established by me under the terms of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (Scheme), to oversee remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank.  The Scheme requires each covered institution to prepare and submit a plan to structure the remuneration packages of directors and executives so as to take account the objectives of the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">The relevant plans have been prepared and submitted by the covered institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank, and in line with timeframes set out in the Scheme, CIROC will report to me on or before 5th March 2009, making a recommendation where appropriate, on the compliance by the institution with the terms of the Scheme.  The Scheme provides that if required, I may direct the institution to amend the remuneration plan to comply with the Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">The Taoiseach announced in the House yesterday that in the context of recapitalisation of the banks, that he would expect director's fees to be cut by 25% and when they appoint their top executives there would be an upper limit on remuneration and that he would expect whatever it is at the moment would be cut by at least 25% as well.  I will consider, in consultation with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, whether it is appropriate to apply similar rules to Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

            <p eId="para_2277">The National Treasury Management Agency have advised me that the expected cost of financing the national debt in 2009 is estimated at €4,500 million, which represents an increase of €2,401 million on that for 2008.  The reasons for this increase are: the costs of funding the now larger Exchequer deficits for 2008 and 2009; higher interest rates on Government bonds; and timing differences arising from interest accrued in 2008 but payable in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">At Budget time in October last an Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of €13,412 million in 2009 was forecast.  The expected cost of financing the national debt in 2009, based on the Budget day forecast for borrowing, was €3,956 million.  The Addendum to the Stability Programme Update, which was published in early January, presented revised forecasts for the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement.  The 2009 requirement is now forecast at €17,980 million.  This represents an increase of €4,568 million over the Budget day forecast and in terms of financing costs the estimate has increased by €544 million.  The main reasons for this are: the increase in the estimate for the 2009 Exchequer Borrowing Requirement, as referred to above; and the higher interest rates currently prevailing on Government bonds.</p>

            <p eId="para_2351">The salaries, bonuses and pension arrangements for the Chairman, Chief Executive, non-executive and executive Directors of Anglo Irish Bank for the years 2006 and 2007 are available in Anglo Irish Bank's Annual Reports, which are available on the bank's website.  I expect the Annual Report for 2008 to be posted on the website before the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">As I announced on 20th January in my speech on the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Bill, the day-to-day running of Anglo Irish Bank will continue as normal and will be managed on a commercial basis at arms length from the Government.  Therefore matters in relation to remuneration of directors and executives at Anglo Irish Bank will continue to be determined in the normal way at the bank unless I decide to exercise my functions under Section 20 of the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act 2009 and in which case terms and conditions including remuneration will be set in accordance with advice from my officials, and having consulted with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">Section 47 of the Guarantee Scheme requires each covered institution to prepare a plan to structure the remuneration packages of directors and executives, including total salary, bonuses, pension payments and any other benefits, so as to take account the objectives of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">The three member, independent committee CIROC (the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee), will oversee all remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank.  Anglo Irish Bank has submitted its report to CIROC, which will report to me in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">The Scheme provides that if I consider, following the advice of CIROC, that the institution has not demonstrated how its remuneration policies for the year ahead will comply with Section 47,  I may direct the covered institution to amend its remuneration plan so that compliance is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">It is important to emphasise that one of the key features of this part of the Scheme is the requirement to orient the system of bonuses to create the appropriate incentives that point toward reduction in excessive risk-taking and that promote long-term sustainability.  A covered institution may not enter into any contractual arrangements that provides for termination compensation or equivalent to be payable to any director or executive for the duration of the Bank Guarantee Scheme.  The Taoiseach announced in the House yesterday that in the context of recapitalisation of the banks, that he would expect director's fees to be cut by 25% and when they appoint their top executives there would be an upper limit on remuneration and that he would expect whatever it is at the moment would be cut by at least 25% as well.  I will consider, in consultation with the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, whether it is appropriate to apply similar rules to Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

A submission detailing the priority projects to be funded from disposals to date and planned future disposals is expected to be made by the HSE, for consideration by my Department and the Department of Finance, within the coming months.  It is envisaged that this submission will provide an opportunity to achieve overall agreement on the extent and timing of property disposals to facilitate the modernisation of the mental health infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_2432">Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, individuals who require long-term residential care will contribute a maximum of 80% of their net assessable income whether for public or private nursing home care. In calculating an individual's net assessable income, it is proposed that account can be taken of specified items of expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2433">Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum.  The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual or €72,000 for a couple.  The State will meet the balance of cost thereafter in public or private nursing homes and an individual's family and/or friends will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care. An individual can choose any nursing home subject to a) its ability to meet their care needs and b) availability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2434">Contributions based on Irish land-based assets may be deferred for the duration of a person's lifetime and repaid from their estate.  If an individual opts to defer this portion of the contribution, the Revenue Commissioners will collect it upon settlement of their estate. However, this deferred contribution element of the scheme is voluntary.  Individuals may choose to pay as they go in which case no money would be repayable from their estate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">Where the contribution is based on the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse going into long-term residential care while the other remains in the home.  This means that after three years in care, an individual will not be liable for any further deferred contribution based on the principal residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the contribution may be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.  With regard to the current situation, the person in question should apply to the HSE for subvention or enhanced subvention, As that is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_2444">Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  The overall emphasis is on promoting a high quality service, delivered to those who require it, in the most appropriate setting.  A critical concern is to ensure that the needs of patients and clients are met as much as possible in a community setting and, where this is not possible, through residential services.   Home care packages, home helps, day and respite care together with meals and wheels form an integral  component of the Government's strategy of supporting older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">The present standards for nursing homes are set out in the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations and the HSE inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards.   Under the Health Act, 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services for inspecting and registering all residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.    Once this part of the 2007 Act is commenced, the Chief Inspector will inspect centres against the regulations governing these centres and standards set by HIQA.  Formal standards are a key requirement for inspection and registration.  An important function of HIQA is the setting of standards on safety and quality in relation to services provided by the HSE and service providers and to monitor their compliance in an open and transparent way.   The Chief Inspector will inspect centres against the regulations governing these centres and standards set by the Authority with a view to promoting safety and quality in the provision of health and personal social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">The Executive is working on an Action Plan to prioritise a phased programme of refurbishment and replacement of existing nursing homes where necessary, to meet the proposed new standards.  Where existing residents have to be relocated, the HSE works closely with the residents and their families to ensure that they are relocated to other facilities which will best meet their needs.  The Deputy will appreciate that ongoing reviews are essential to ensuring that resources are appropriately channelled, that the changing needs of older people are suitably addressed and that the HSE continue to address infrastructural deficits to meet new standards, health &amp; safety and fire requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2450">Both the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as appropriate, contract with private hospitals for the provision of acute hospital services for public patients.  The HSE has made arrangements with private hospitals for the provision of, for example, radiotherapy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">The NTPF is funded from the Vote for my Department.  The Fund receives an annual allocation from which it arranges a quantum of in-patient treatments and out-patient appointments for the year, in line with an agreed service plan.   The Fund is obliged to adhere to a direction to source at least 90% of the treatments it arranges from the private hospital system.  The NTPF may purchase a maximum of 10% of its overall capacity from the public hospital system where this does not adversely affect core services.  The purchasing of such capacity is necessary in order not to exclude patients whose surgical needs are best met within the public hospital system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">The NTPF negotiates overall prices for procedures with individual private hospitals which includes pre and post operative consultations, consultant fees and hospital costs, etc.  The fund is continuing in 2009 to deal with private hospitals on the same basis as in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">The HSE and the NTPF have confirmed to me that no letters of comfort or analogous commitments have been issued by them to private hospital providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2459">When I considered the business plans of the three airports and the views of the boards, I accepted their overall conclusion that it would be best to defer the separation of the three airports (under the State Airports Act 2004) given the current very difficult aviation market. I took the view that it would be best to provide a reasonable period of time to enable the boards and management to address the very significant challenges facing the aviation market and decided to defer separation to 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">Discussions are taking place between the chairpersons of the three airport authorities to ensure that appropriate governance arrangements are in place in the period before eventual separation. The aim is to put in place structures that will allow Cork and Shannon airports to be operated under a commercial mandate at local level while ensuring appropriate safeguards for accountability to the DAA. I should add that these governance arrangements will provide an opportunity for Cork Airport to realise the potential provided by the very substantial investment in the airport in recent years. Shannon Airport will also be in a strong position to reap the benefits of US preclearance facilities, due for introduction at the airport in the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2549">Firstly, there is an external storage facility in Dublin that is utilized by my Department to store surplus office furniture and which my Department considers to have value and can be used again. Such storage is temporary in nature and is drawn upon as circumstances require in any of the Department's fifteen locations countrywide. The bulk of the furniture currently in storage was stored in late 2007 and it is planned to use it again later this year in the context of an office refurbishment project in the Department's Leeson Lane offices. This contractual arrangement provides for the availability of storage as and when required by the Department. Costs are determined on the basis of the volume of space utilized. In 2008 this amounted to €17,322 and a similar provision is envisaged for this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">The second external storage facility, located in Limerick, stores documents from the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division based in Shannon. Costs are also based on volume of space utilized and in 2008 the cost involved amounted to €19,600.</p>

            <p eId="para_2556">Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) are funded by the Irish Youth Justice Service, through An Garda Síochána. These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, and promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  There are 100 GYDPs throughout the country, of which 11 are operating in Co. Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_2557">I can confirm that an application to establish a Garda Youth Diversion Project in Carrigaline, Co. Cork is one of over thirty similar applications from across the country which were received by the Garda Commissioner in 2008. However, the planned expansion in the number of projects beyond the existing 100 is currently being assessed in the light of the changed economic climate and, in this context, the focus will be on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the services provided. The Irish Youth Justice Service and the Garda Síochána are reviewing the effectiveness of the diversionary measures as set out under the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. In view of the circumstances, I do not, at this stage, expect to announce any new projects in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2572">I wish to inform the Deputy that my Department does not have a formal contract in place for the provision of taxi services but the practice in recent years has been to use the services of a particular company.  Following a review of expenditure in this area in 2008, the Department is currently in the process of issuing a public tender for the provision of a taxi service.  Moreover, in the light of budgetary constraints the circumstances in which taxi services can be availed of has been significantly curtailed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">The recording of expenditure on taxi services does not allow for the precise identification of the spend under this heading.  However, this spend is in the order of €85,000 for both years in question.</p>

As the Deputy will appreciate, due to the nature of INIS's operations, in particular, case processing, it is necessary to retain a substantial amount of paper based records. The cost for this facility in 2008 was €24,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_2744">Following advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) and on the Government E-Tenders website, a contract was awarded on 17th November 2006 for the replacement of the existing Garda Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) together with extension of the system to cater for Immigration and Asylum requirements and its integration with existing Garda and Immigration Systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2745">The competition was conducted under EU Restricted Tendering procedures and the successful bidder was a consortium led by Accenture and included Motorola and Daon. The contract value was €18.585m providing for the development cost of the system, required hardware and software and 3 years post implementation support. The project is jointly funded from the Garda Síochána and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">The system has been delivered over a number of phases.  The first phase — which involved the replacement of the ageing existing AFIS system and the provision of new AFIS services to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commission (ORAC) — went live in October 2007.  Subsequent phases of the project which included provision of AFIS services to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, preparation of the system for integration with PULSE and provision of access to the Garda International Liaison Office were completed by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">Legal advice throughout the process, including during contract negotiations, was provided as appropriate by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Attorney General. The project was also subjected to the peer review process operated by the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2748">I understand that the system is operating very satisfactorily with significant increases in matches since live operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">The Government is strongly committed to trying to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and other senior members of the new Administration have for some time been strong supporters of comprehensive immigration reform. Since the new year, there have also been helpful public indications that Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and Senator John McCain intend to support action in this area. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the issue remains politically divisive in the US Congress and making progress will be challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">The members of the new Administration and Congress are currently taking up office in Washington, and the Government is in the process of establishing substantive contact with them. In doing so, we are building on the extensive work on behalf of the undocumented that the Government has carried out over recent years with many of those now within the Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">The Taoiseach, I and other members of Government will use the unique opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US to engage the new Administration at the very highest level on the situation of the undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">Our Ambassador in Washington will continue to attach the highest priority to this issue in his ongoing contacts with the Obama Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">More broadly, the Government is actively seeking to reform our overall migration arrangements with the United States. In addition to our work on behalf of the undocumented, the Government recently concluded a new Working Holiday Agreement with the United States and is working to secure the passage of legislation which would enable Irish citizens to avail of the E3 working visa currently open to Australians.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_2810">Most of Ireland's expenditure on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) is provided under Vote 29, International Co-operation. The programme is administered by the Development Co-operation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid. Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2811">Ireland is the sixth most generous aid donor internationally in per capita terms. The Government's development programme is central to our foreign policy. This year, as in previous years, Ireland will have one of the strongest aid programmes in the world, with a particular focus on the poorest people in the developing world, especially in the least developed countries in Africa. We are taking a leadership role internationally on the global hunger crisis, and the aid programme will continue to reflect this priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">The total ODA budget allocation for 2008 was €899 million. €769 million of this total was allocated under Vote 29 with an additional estimated €130 million to be contributed by other Government Departments. The Vote 29 allocation was fully utilised and, while the outturn figure for other ODA has not yet been finalised, it is expected that it will be close to the estimated €130 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">Under the Budget for 2009, the Government last October allocated a total of €891 million to ODA. Of this, €754 million was provided under Vote 29 with a further €137 million being contributed by other Government Departments and through the EU Development Cooperation Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government this week took the difficult decision to reduce the total ODA budget for 2009 to €796 million. The decision was taken as part of the determined effort to curb public expenditure in order to establish a platform for the resumption of strong economic growth, and further expansion of the Government's development programme in years to come.</p>

            <p eId="para_2895">The military authorities conducted a detailed review of the immediate requirements to enable the closure of Monaghan, Lifford, Rockhill and Longford Barracks.  In addition to some immediate renovation work, medium term capital works to provide more permanent arrangements for the transferring personnel, have also been identified.  These works will be completed as part of the ongoing Capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">There were significant facilities already available in the new locations and this facilitated the smooth and successful implementation of the current consolidation programme.  Some additional facilities and some renovations were required across the various barracks.  The immediate costs involved in providing the necessary additional facilities at all three locations was less than €500,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">The cost arising from the barracks closures over 15 months, including the initial renovation works, is estimated at €3.2 million, against annual recurring savings of approximately €2.7 million.  Most of these costs are once off and short-term costs arising from payment of Change of Station Allowance and the provision of transport on a temporary basis.  In the medium term, based on current estimates, the total cost to the Department of closing the proposed barracks (including initial costs, allowances, transport, immediate works and capital works) should amount to approximately €5.9 million while total receipts/savings, including receipts from the disposal of the relevant properties, should amount to around €29.5 million, a net gain of €23.6 million.  The above figures do not take account of the qualitative benefits accruing to the Defence Forces from improvements in collective training, savings on administration and management of the barracks being closed or the costs of currently transporting troops from the barracks being closed for training etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">The closure of the four barracks was completed on the 30th January 2009 and private security firms have been employed to provide security at the barracks in the short term with effect from the 30th January 2009.  As the appointment of these contractors is temporary, for commercial reasons it would be inappropriate to state the cost per week at this stage.  It is not anticipated that Private Security firms will need to be employed in the long term.  However, my Department will continue to monitor the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">The matter of the disposal of this property will be considered in the context of the current property market.  It is my intention that the funding and savings from this initiative will, in accordance with current Government policy, again be reinvested in the Defence Forces.  My Department will consider all of the options open to it in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2921">The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), an independent statutory body established under the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, has no function with regard to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 or the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008.  The Board's principal functions include the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords, the registration of tenancies, and the provision of policy advice to me in relation to the private rented sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2922">The Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 prescribe minimum standards for rented accommodation and came into effect generally on 1 February 2009. These regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply. Certain elements of the new Regulations will not come into effect for existing rental accommodation until 1 February 2013 to allow time for the carrying out of the significant remedial work that may be involved in achieving compliance.  The aspects covered by these provisions — sanitary facilities, heating facilities and food preparation and storage and laundry — will therefore continue to be subject to the relevant provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Housing) Regulations 1993 until then, in so far as existing rental accommodation is concerned. However, any rental properties being let for the first time after 1 February 2009 will have to comply with all the requirements of the new Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2923">The provision of a Building Energy Rating Certificate for all houses offered for sale or letting is mandatory since 1 January 2009, on foot of the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008. This Certificate is unconnected to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2930">In line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the financial provision secured for housing in 2009 will allow for the level of funding allocated towards housing supports for older people and people with a disability this year to be increased by 8% over the initial estimate for 2008.  This provision will enable local authorities to continue to effectively respond to the housing needs of these target groups through the payment of increased numbers of grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_2936">In September 2007, I initiated a major Review of Archaeological Policy and Practice in Ireland. The aim of the review was to make policy and practice in protecting Ireland's archaeological heritage the best there could be and to draw from the experience and advice of experts both at home and abroad to achieve this. A number of seminars were held in October and November 2007 in order to get initial views on the scope of the review.

I am satisfied that the level of funding provided through general purpose grants makes a significant contribution towards enabling all local authorities to provide a reasonable level of services to the public. Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. Kildare County Council's general purpose grant allocation for 2009 is €26,610,812. General purpose grants to Kildare County Council have increased by some 206% since 1997, which is higher than the average increase to local authorities over that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2958">I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 229 and 231 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">The number of households on a local authority's waiting list continuously fluctuates as households on the list are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support. My Department does not hold information on waiting lists. A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities in accordance with the terms of the Housing Act 1988. The last assessment took place in March 2008 and indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support, an increase of some 30% on the corresponding figure in 2005.  Further information regarding the assessments is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie, including a breakdown of the net need figure by housing authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">With regard to the expected impact of the social housing investment programme on waiting lists, it is up to individual housing authorities, including the authorities in Kildare, to plan the composition, management and delivery of their programmes having regard to the specific social housing priorities in their areas and to the Exchequer funding allocations available to them, which are based on their identified 2008 needs. These programmes will be considered by my Department as part of the annual Housing Action Plan Review process which is due to commence shortly. It is expected that through the social housing investment programme in 2009 and, having regard to the availability of suitable housing in the current housing market, including through the recently announced long-term leasing initiative, good progress will be made this year in meeting NDP social housing supply targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_2962">Primary responsibility for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">The Government is committed to the protection and improvement of our water resources and to this end has provided substantially increased funding for the Water Services Investment Programme in 2009.  Implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive is being brought forward through River Basin Districts, with funding being provided by my Department.  Draft River Basin Management Plans were published on 22 December 2008 for each of the eight River Basin Districts on the island of Ireland. These draft plans include proposed programmes of measures for the protection and improvement of water quality.  The draft plans are subject to public consultation for a period of six months until 22 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 and 2007 provide an incentive for farmers to protect waters from agricultural run-off, one of the main threats to water quality.  Farmers who do not farm in accordance with good agricultural practice face a penalty under the Single Payment or other schemes where they are found, on inspection, to have breached a statutory requirement or may face prosecution by local authorities, who are the designated control authorities under the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">Discharges from municipal wastewater treatment have also been identified as a key threat to water quality. A Water Services Authority who commits an offence under the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 may face prosecution by the EPA which is the designated control authority for these Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2969">Some €560 million has been provided for my Department's Water Services Investment Programme in 2009, the highest ever such allocation and an increase of 19% over the 2008 provision.  This is a clear statement of the priority assigned by Government to the preservation and protection of our water resources, to meeting EU standards for drinking water and wastewater treatment and to providing critical water and wastewater infrastructure.  It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to deliver quality public water supplies to meet current and future needs. The quality of individual supplies is monitored by the EPA and its most recent report "The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland  — A Report for the Years 2006 and 2007" is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_2970">I have put in place a rigorous supervisory framework to ensure good quality drinking water is provided and that effective mechanisms are available to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, local authority drinking water supplies are subject to supervision by the EPA and I have given the Agency the necessary resources to back up its new enforcement powers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">Under the drinking water regulations, local authorities are obliged to ensure that any failure to meet quality standards in a water supply is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  The authority is also obliged to inform the EPA promptly and to consult with the Health Service Executive.  Where incidences of contamination occur, the EPA can issue such directions to the local authority as necessary to prevent or remove any health risk.  Failure to comply with such a direction is an indictable offence and subject to heavy penalties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2972">I am satisfied that the policies and resources in place will ensure that our water supplies are capable of meeting the required quality standards and current and anticipated demands.</p>

            <p eId="para_2982">I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2983">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish new ambitious waste management targets for maximum prevention, re-use, recycling and modern waste treatment to ensure that we match the best performance in the EU for recycling with the objective that only 10% of waste or less is consigned to landfill and to ensure that the landfills currently provided for under regional waste management plans should be the last to be constructed for a generation. In addition, the Programme contains a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and act on its conclusions.  This review is currently underway and will inform the development of waste policy upon completion. Ireland must also meet challenging targets under the EU Landfill Directive for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years. Following extensive consultation, the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste was published in April 2006 and is aimed at diverting 80% of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill through segregated collection and the generation of compost.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to implementation of the National Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2984">I have also indicated my intention to introduce primary legislation to allow significant increases in the landfill levy and a Regulatory Impact Analysis for this purpose has been completed.  My Department, in addition, is working with industry towards the development of a Statutory Instrument for the segregation of commercial biodegradable waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">Last year, I issued a circular to all local authorities to drive forward the roll out of brown bins and promote the use of home composting and the report indicates progress in relation to home composting.  I am confident that all of the above measures will contribute significantly to the achievement of the targets for the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill and a reduction in our overall use of landfill.</p>

            <p eId="para_2987">My Department continues to provide strong support for the regeneration project across Limerick City, through ongoing liaison with the Limerick Northside and Southside Regeneration Agencies and with the local authorities in the area.  In 2008 alone, some €16 million was provided under the national regeneration programme and the Department's sustainable communities fund to support the development of the city's integrated regeneration programme and area masterplans, to fund an ambitious schedule of demolition and enabling works, as well as to implement the associated regeneration relocation strategy.  In addition, funding was provided for an array of social inclusion and community development initiatives including neighbourhood safety and environmental improvement works.   Within the overall funding available to my Department for the provision and improvement of social housing for 2009, I intend to increase the level of support to ensure that the Limerick regeneration project continues to progress, to meet the costs of the Regeneration Agencies, to facilitate a number of households wishing to move in line with the overall regeneration strategy, and for related matters.  While authorities have received provisional notification of their 2009 allocation of some €28 million, this has yet to be finalised within the context of the overall national regeneration programme and the wider estimates process.  It is expected that final allocations will be confirmed by the beginning of April.</p>

         the policies he and the energy regulator are pursuing to ensure a more competitive supply of energy here in view of the recent announcement that Ireland will receive €100 million to invest in an east-west interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3033">The Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government set out the Government's commitment to delivering a reliable and competitively priced energy supply in support of economic growth and competitiveness.  The introduction of the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM) in November 2007 marked an important milestone in the development of competition in the Irish electricity sector.  The SEM is a wholesale electricity market supplying some 2.5 million electricity customers.  It represents a significant step towards the All-Island Energy Market, which will encourage open and transparent competition in electricity and gas and a more stable and attractive investment location for independent players.</p>
            <p eId="para_3034">In this context, the Government has also ensured a reduction in ESB's market share in power generation through the recent sale to Endesa of approximately 1,300 megawatts of generation capacity.  This has introduced a major new international player into the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3035">The Government will continue to implement the opening of the electricity and gas markets in line with EU Internal Energy Market Directives. This commitment to liberalise the gas and electricity sectors will take place in the context of EU developments, including the development of Regional Energy markets, as well as the all-island energy framework and the interests of the economy and consumers north and south.</p>
            <p eId="para_3036">In addition to these measures, the Government has given the go-ahead for the construction of a 500 megawatt electricity interconnector between Wales and Ireland by 2012. The interconnector will further promote competition in the electricity market and will allow third-party access in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.  This in turn will assert downward pressure on electricity prices.  The new interconnector will also enhance our security of supply, reduce our dependency on electricity generated from gas and allow us to accelerate our development of renewable energy, providing potential opportunities for the export of wind-generated electricity.  The European Commission has included the Interconnector on the list of energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Package, which is currently being negotiated in Brussels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3037">I welcome the Commission's recognition of the strategic importance of the project and will continue to work intensively in the negotiations with Member States and the European Parliament to secure the funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_3146">It is a matter for each school's Board of Management to have an enrolment policy and to then operate that policy in a fair and consistent manner having regard to the overall physical capacity of a school. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3147">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
            <p eId="para_3148">My Department's responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. That is no more than a normal feature of the enrolment process in any community.  What is not acceptable is that any school authority would in the coming year alter its approach to enrolment simply because it wants to pressurise the government or to give support to a campaign being conducted by a teacher union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">As I have previously pointed out in the House, the changes to the classroom staffing of primary schools reverts schools to the position that applied just over one school year ago. Schools are given teaching resources commensurate with their enrolment and under the staffing schedule schools with like enrolments are treated in the same way. In terms of accommodating pupils I believe it is totally reasonable to expect schools to operate from next September no less favourably than they did in 2006/2007.  Any school acting dishonourably in this regard must ultimately answer to its local community and to the parents and children in that community in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence shortly. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3179">Retention periods for Departmental records are determined by their administrative, legal, fiscal, or historical values.  Records of historical value are transferred from off-site storage to the National Archives 30 years from the closing date of the particular file.  In line with the National Archives Act 1986, no Departmental records may be destroyed without permission from the National Archives Office.  My Department is liaising with the National Archives to obtain Disposal Certificates for files which are not of archival value.  Once these certificates have been acquired, such files will be confidentially disposed of.</p>

            <p eId="para_3183">There are currently 258 primary schools with more than two language support teachers.  The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, there will be some  alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.</p>
