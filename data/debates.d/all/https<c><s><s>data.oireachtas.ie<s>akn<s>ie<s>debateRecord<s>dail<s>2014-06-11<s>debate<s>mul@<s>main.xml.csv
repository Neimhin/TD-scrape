Tá imní ar a lán daoine mar gheall ar an seirbhís aeir go dtí na hoileáin. Tá conradh reatha ann go dtí deireadh Meán Fómhair 2014, ach céard a tharlóidh ina dhiaidh sin?

Cuirim fáilte roimhe chomh maith go bhfuil an chéad cheist i nGaeilge. Tá conradh i bhfeidhm ag mo Roinn le hAer Arann chun seirbhís aeir a chur ar fáil chuig na hOileáin Árann. Tiocfaidh deiridh leis an gconradh ar 30 Meán Fómhair i mbliana. Faoi théarmaí an chonartha, tá sé de rogha ag mo Roinn síneadh bliana a chur leis go 30 Meán Fómhair 2015. Mar is eol don Teachta, d’fhostaigh mo Roinn an comhlacht Ernst & Young chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar riachtanas na seirbhíse aeir, i gcomhréir le rialacháin an Aontais Eorpaigh. Agus an t-athbhreithniú ar siúl ag Ernst & Young, tuigtear dom go ndearnadh teagmháil dhíreach le páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla chun a dtuairimí a fháil faoin tseirbhís aeir. Ina theannta sin, tuigtear dom gur tugadh deis, trí na comharchumainn ar na hoileáin, páirtithe leasmhara eile a aithint a mbeadh suim acu aighneacht a dhéanamh. Tá an tuarascáil athbhreithnithe curtha i gcrích ag an chomhlacht Ernst & Young. Foilsíodh é ar shuíomh gréasáin mo Roinne ar an 28 Bealtaine seo caite. Is tuarascáil chuimsitheach atá ann a chlúdaíonn an tréimhse ó 2003 go dtí 2013. Aithníonn an tuarascáil na tionchair éagsúla atá ag an tseirbhís aeir ar shaol na n-oileánach, chomh maith le costais éagsúla na seirbhíse agus an treo ina bhfuil na costais sin ag dul. Tá an tuarascáil curtha ag mo Roinn faoi bhráid an Choimisiúin Eorpaigh i gcomhréir le rialacháin an Aontais Eorpaigh. Maidir leis an chéad chéim eile, tá sé ag dul do na páirtithe leasmhara go léir go scrúdófar gach a bhfuil sa tuarascáil chun go mbeidh mo Roinn ábalta freastal ar riachtanais na n-oileán taobh istigh de na hacmhainní atá ar fáil. Beifear ag scrúdú na moltaí atá sa tuarascáil go mion sa tréimhse atá romhainn, sula dtógtar aon chinneadh maidir le todhchaí na seirbhíse.

Ba cheart go mbeadh leanúnachas ann, ionas go mbeimid cinnte go bhfuil seirbhís fadtéarmach i gceist. Táimid ag caint faoi chúrsaí gnó, cúrsaí turasóireachta agus an ceangal idir an t-oileán agus an mórthír. An féidir leis an Aire Stáit níos mó eolais a thabhairt dúinn faoin seirbhís mar a bheidh sí sna blianta amach romhainn? Dúirt sé go bhfuil athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ag a Roinn faoi láthair. Cén uair a bheidh an t-athbhreithniú sin críochnaithe? Cén uair a thiocfaidh cinneadh ón Rialtas?

Tá sé de rogha againn bliain eile a chur leis an gconradh ina dhiaidh sin. Tuigim go rímhaith cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an tseirbhís seo do mhuintir na n-oileáin, do chúrsaí tionsclaíochta agus turasóireachta agus do shaol na n-oileán i gcoitinne. Mar a dúirt mé, tá tuairiscí agus moltaí cuimsitheacha curtha ar fáil sa tuarascáil chuimsitheach atá ullmhaithe ag Ernst & Young. Tá siad á scrúdú i láthair na huaire. Déanfaimid cinneadh maidir leis an seirbhís gan mhoill sna seachtainí nó na míonna amach romhainn. Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go n-aithnímid go bhfuil an tseirbhís an-tábhachtach ar fad.

Cad atá i gceist anois i dtaobh na saineolaithe atá ag plé leis an athbhreithniú agus le rialacha an Aontais Eorpaigh? De réir mar a thuigim, caithfear an tuarascáil a sheoladh go dtí an Coimisiún Eorpach. Cén uair a bheidh sé ag dul go dtí an coimisiún chun freagra a fháil, ionas go mbeimid in ann cinneadh a dhéanamh? Tuigim nach bhfuil an tuarascáil imithe go dtí an coimisiún go fóill.

Can he give the House an update on the progress that has been made in preserving the national monument at Moore Street?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	As the Deputy is aware, I recently approved the revised designs that were submitted by the owners of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street for the restoration of the monument buildings and the creation of a commemorative centre to the leaders of the 1916 Rising on the site. In July 2013, I signed an order of consent that approved the commemorative centre proposal and the full repair and conservation of the monument buildings. I refused consent for the demolition of any structures, or removal of material from the site, that dated from or before 1916. I also ruled out plans for the development of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument and the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16. The July 2013 consent was conditional on the submission to me of revised project designs that took full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent had been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works. The revised designs were received in March of this year. Following consultation with interested parties and a full assessment, I approved the revisions subject to a number of new conditions. Among the new conditions are requirements for a new gable wall to be constructed at No.14 Moore Street, instead of the temporary finish that would otherwise have been in place until the wider development went ahead; and for a new building, to be incorporated into the commemorative centre, to be constructed to the side of No. 17 Moore Street as part of the restoration project. I believe the decision I have made on the revised designs will secure the future of one of the most important sites in modern Irish history.The accompanying conditions will also ensure the restored buildings will, from day one, have a standard of finish and appearance that befits their historical importance. It is now a matter for the monument owners to progress the works. I emphasise again that my functions under the National Monuments Acts relate only to the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street by virtue of the preservation order placed on that site in 2007. The development of the wider Moore Street area and related matters are the responsibility of the planning authority, Dublin City Council.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The decision to grant permission for the development of Moore Street is tantamount to providing for the obliteration of what has been described by the National Museum of Ireland as the most important site in modern Irish history. The Government's proposal to turn Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street into an interpretative centre, while welcome, is inadequate as it fails to match the importance of the site. Under the current plan, the rest of the terrace on Moore Street is to be demolished. If Chartered Land is allowed to proceed with its plans, the lanes of history surrounding Moore Street will be bulldozed and covered by a shopping mall. The entire Moore Street battlefield site should be developed and protected as a national monument. This would be a fitting centre for the centenary of the 1916 Rising and would give an economic boost to the north inner city of Dublin. It could also provide a prestigious international education and tourism facility. Does the Minister agree that allowing Chartered Land to proceed with its plans undermines all the work that has been done to preserve Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street? Does he agree that the site will become nothing more than a museum in a shopping centre?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	As I have stated several times, responsibility for planning and the broader site rests with Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála. My responsibility relates specifically to the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. I engaged in a long process, which lasted for three years, under which I granted permission to carry out works on the national monument and I am now satisfied that the best solution has been found. I refused consent to demolish some of the structures at the rear of the national monument, for example, the facades on Moore Lane, and I did not grant permission to proceed with an underground car park. The planning for the broader site rests with Dublin City Council. I and my Department have carried out our responsibilities and ensured the national monument will be protected. The best solution has been found. An impression is being given that everything will be demolished. I reiterate that two lanes, Henry Place and O'Rahilly Place, will be retained. and a further lane, Moore Lane, will be retained, albeit under a glass rain cover. It is important to note, that the lanes of history will remain. 
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The cross-party group on Moore Street met the Minister and outlined its deep concerns at the proposed developments. Members of all parties believe strongly that the area should not be levelled to make way for a giant shopping mall. As guardian of the monument, the Minister could have done more to avoid the destruction of an area of major historical importance. Sinn Féin wants Moore Street to be fully preserved and developed as the cornerstone of a 1916 revolutionary quarter, incorporating the surrounding lanes of history. Will the Minister reconsider his decision to allow the proposed development by Chartered Land?

I am satisfied, and I believe most people will agree, that the decision reached was the best one for the national monument on Moore Street. As the Deputy is aware, the issue of the broader site rests with Dublin City Council and the council will make a decision on what it wants on the site. The developer must satisfy the council and An Bord Pleanála that its plans for the site reflect its historical importance and the events that took place at Easter 1916.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	As the Deputy is aware, the programme of centenary commemorations has been developing continuously in recent years and the volume and significance of events being commemorated will continue to increase as we look towards 2016 and the centenary of the Easter Rising. The all-party consultation group on commemorations, which I chair, has been briefed by a large number of commemorations stakeholders and continues to engage with as many interested parties as possible. These parties have included the Women's History Association Ireland, the national cultural institutions and a range of local and community groups. The all-party consultation group also maintains ongoing relationships with key partners, including the Department of Defence, An Post and academic partners. The group is periodically briefed by State agencies and relevant Departments on the status of capital projects being undertaken for completion by 1916, including the GPO project, and developments under the auspices of the Office of Public Works. It also receives media briefings.  On a partnership and collaborative basis, my Department has forged strong contacts with a range of partners, including the trade union movement, for example, in connection with the centenary of the Dublin Lock-out of 1913. The Glasnevin Trust has also been a key partner in a series of commemorative events at Glasnevin Cemetery. The successful implementation of a programme of events marking the centenary of the founding of Cumann na mBan is only the most recent example of such a collaborative approach with the Women's History Association of Ireland. The participation of the President at a formal commemoration in Glasnevin Cemetery was supplemented by events at Wynn's Hotel and a special conference at the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks.  I have been greatly assisted in the task of consultation through the work of the expert advisory group of distinguished historians, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning. The group plans to continue its programme of public consultation around the country in the run-up to 2016. Its local meetings have been well attended by members of local history societies and community groups and members of the general public.  My Department has also sought to engage public interest, including through its support for the RTE-Boston College Century Ireland digital newspaper and a series of supplements published by The Irish Times at appropriate dates around key centenaries. The most recent of these, entitled Countdown to War, was published on 14 May last and I have arranged for it to be distributed to every school and made available online. I am keen to continue to build a programme of events with the broadest possible base of support and I welcome the views of Members on how particular events can be commemorated.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	As a member of the decades committee, I am aware of the extent of input into the committee. I note that the mission statement of the advisory group refers to ensuring "that significant events are commemorated accurately, proportionately and appropriately in tone". I acknowledge that many of the commemorations thus far have been extremely well-organised, dignified and fitting, although questions have arisen regarding the way in which some of the events have been advertised to the public. Members of the public must be afforded a space in which to give their views on how to commemorate the momentous events of the period from 1912 to 1922, notably the Easter Rising, which is central to the decade of commemorations. Ordinary people and families must be given a space to give their views. When Irish Aid undertook its review of Irish aid, it held a series of public consultations and meetings nationwide, which were well attended and at which people engaged. Ordinary communities are involved in the decade of commemorations. For example, a drama group in East Wall in my constituency was heavily involved in the commemoration of the 1913 Lock-out and the Howth community is involved in the commemoration of the Howth gun-running. We must embrace members of the public by giving them an opportunity to engage. 
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	The principal focus is on those who participated in the events in question. Last November, for example, we held a very dignified ceremony to mark the establishment of the Volunteers. As has been acknowledged, we also had a very dignified ceremony in Glasnevin Cemetery to mark the establishment of Cumann na mBan, followed by a seminar in Wynn's Hotel to mark the occasion. The focus was on the individuals who were involved at the time and their families.That is how I want to keep it, ensuring the focus is on those who participated and their families. That will be the focus of the 1916 commemorations. I want all those who were in any way associated with it to be involved. There was major community involvement in the 1913 Lock-out commemoration. Anyone who was on O'Connell Street that day saw that there was a major local input, as there will be in the commemoration of the Howth gun running. Wherever appropriate, there will be local involvement, as has manifested to date. The commemorations section in my Department is working very closely with all community groups, where appropriate.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I was getting at the idea of having a space for ordinary citizens to give their views on how these events should be commemorated to ensure their voices are also listened to. The suggestion that there be a royal presence at the 1916 commemorations is controversial and it would be good to get the views of ordinary citizens on it. Will the decade of commemorations be extended to include the Civil War? That will be a very difficult event to commemorate. Again, it is very important that we provide a space for ordinary people to express their views on how it should be commemorated, remembered or addressed.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	The focus this year is very much on the outbreak of the First World War which must be commemorated properly because 49,000 Irish men and women died during it. There will then be a major focus on the 1916 Rising and, as I have repeated many times, the participants will be the families of those who were affected in any way by it. Almost 2,000 people were involved in 1916, including 200 members of Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, who must be acknowledged. Regarding invited guests, there will be plenty of opportunities for people to share common platforms, while retaining the focus on those who were affected or participated. My Department's website offers people an opportunity to contribute. Century Ireland, an online historical newspaper published fortnightly, is attracting much attention. Last year I held a special seminar for local authorities to emphasise how they could be involved and embrace the commemorations. If the Deputy has other ideas, will she, please, pass them on? I have listened to her in the past and will do so in the future. The next significant event to commemorate will be the Howth gun running, in which there will be major community involvement.

At the outset of the project there was uncertainty about the funding available and we wonder what the situation is now regarding funding spent and whether there will be adequate funding available to see the project through to its conclusion without going over budget.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	As the Deputy is aware, in the past six years overall funding to the arts and culture sector has been declining in line with other Government spending. In this climate securing funds for any new initiative such as the inaugural national city of culture presented a significant challenge. In April 2012 the Limerick Reorganisation Implementation Group, LRIG, sent an outline proposal to my Department entitled, Limerick City of Culture 2014, setting out the proposition that the designation of Limerick as national city of culture in 2014 would lead to long-lasting renewal. In May 2012 I received a letter from the LRIG with a further iteration of this document. On 3 July 2012 the Government considered the proposal and the national city of culture initiative was agreed. During the remainder of 2012 and 2013 Limerick developed a programme of arts and cultural events and plans for 2014. On 15 October 2013 the Minister for Finance announced an allocation of €6 million from the proceeds of the sale of the national lottery to the Limerick national city of culture project. Securing funding of this level, in very difficult economic circumstances, was a major achievement. This allocation was notified ten weeks in advance of the programme starting and 62 weeks ahead of the programme's closure. However, potential funding of that general magnitude had been signalled to Limerick city of culture as early as April 2013 to assist in the preparatory work on the programme. Up to and including last Monday, 9 June, €1.713 million had been paid to Limerick City and County Council in respect of the national city of culture, in accordance with arrangements put in place in a memorandum of understanding and service level agreement which I signed with the city and county manager. This means that €4.287 million remains to be drawn down. The programme elements to which the local authority has applied this funding are available on my Department's website, as is other information on the arts, culture and heritage programming which is being presented in Limerick this year. I particularly draw the Deputy's attention to the made in Limerick programme which comprises more than 100 grants to arts, culture and heritage practitioners, most of whom are from in and around the city of Limerick. To date, the programme has been very strong and keynote events have met with great critical acclaim. That strength and acclaim would not support any contention that the generosity of the taxpayer support for this initiative was in any way a negative factor. The Deputy will agree on the importance of judging the Limerick city of culture initiative on the quality and success of the programme over the course of the year, rather than any other more peripheral factor.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	While I agree that the time for effective evaluation will be at the end of the process, we must take into account the fact that those directly involved, including the county manager, to whom the Minister referred, expressed concern at the delay in announcing the initial tranche of funding. Some expressed the view that difficulties ensued in attracting the sort of philanthropic investment that was so important to the initiative. The Minister has pioneered philanthropic contributions in this area. Six months into the process it is prudent to examine the financial position and see how the initiative is progressing. Given that the Minister has said €1.17 million has been spent and €4.2 million remains to be spent, I take it that he can assure us that the budget of €6 million which will be money well spent if, as we all hope, the project is successful will not be exceeded.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I am very encouraged by the way the Limerick city of culture programme is developing and the positive response nationally and locally to the project. The people of Limerick realise this is a wonderful opportunity for them which they must embrace. The 100 grants to local arts groups are bringing out the best in Limerick. People in places such as Moyross and Southill are coming forward with good content. If the Deputy has not already done so, I suggest he attend some of the events in Limerick. I suggest public representatives go to see how culture is improving morale and pride in the city. Some major events are forthcoming. In April 2013 the Limerick city of culture committee was told €6 million would be made available and that it should structure a programme around this commitment. The commitment could not be given until the budget, which was always made clear, when it could be clarified by the Minister for Finance.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I take it then that the Minister is giving an assurance that the budget of €6 million will not be exceeded. A criticism of the Department is that the selection of Limerick as city of culture arose in the absence of any competition whatsoever, meaning there was no opportunity for other cities to compete for the position. I also hold the view one has to start somewhere and that Limerick was probably the best place to start. However, there is a general public concern that this level of public funding was committed to a project without there being any transparency in the process and that the Department tried to provide some sort of retrospective rationale for the selection of Limerick for this initiative. Will the Minister address those concerns?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	As I said before, when I was appointed Minister, I visited Limerick on several occasions to open art exhibitions and venues. It struck me then that the wider perception of Limerick did not reflect the level of activity in the artistic, cultural and heritage areas in the city. I had discussions with the three main education institutions there, the arts community on two occasions, the Chamber of Commerce and the regeneration group on how we could use culture to improve the image of Limerick and help with its regeneration. They responded by coming forward with a very good proposal, namely that Limerick could be designated as the 2014 city of culture to coincide with the change of governance in Limerick and the significant amount of money being spent by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Limerick City Council on the city’s physical regeneration. We wanted a cultural regeneration to accompany that. I then presented a proposal that there would be a national city of culture programme starting with Limerick. I accept there was no competition. I am delighted, however, that several cities have inquired of my Department and directly of myself, expressing an interest in the next designation of city of culture and ensuring they will have ample opportunity to apply for it. That was the process and it goes down to this time in Limerick when it was going through major change in regeneration and governance.

In regard to national monuments legislation, it should be noted that a comprehensive new national monuments Bill is being drafted for publication later this year. While my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is responsible for policy, oversight and legislation in the planning and development system, my role in planning is set out in the Planning and Development Acts which establish the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as a prescribed body in matters affecting built and natural heritage. Local authority development plans must include objectives for the conservation and protection of the archaeological and natural heritage, as well as for the protection of structures of special historical, archaeological or cultural interest. My Department provides advice to planning authorities during the drafting and review of development plans for archaeological, architectural heritage and nature conservation issues. This ensures all planning authorities obtain consistent and coherent advice. In 2011, I reissued the statutory architectural heritage protection guidelines for planning authorities. Chapters Nos. 2 and 3 concern the protection of architectural heritage in development plans, including the protection of individual structures and architectural conservation areas. The issue of the settings of both protected structures and architectural conservation areas is an integral part of the guidelines. My Department additionally provides a series of guidance documents on the protection of the built heritage. These are prepared with input from a range of relevant stakeholders, including other Departments, the Heritage Council and local authority representation. In this way, my Department works collaboratively to bring consistency to the consideration of the built heritage at local authority level while recognising the need for local democratic decision-making and prioritisation. I consider the approach adopted by my Department provides an appropriate oversight mechanism for the protection of our heritage within the planning system.

We are talking about the aesthetics of what we have besides national monuments. Conceivably, we could have a massive shopping centre at the entrance to Newgrange or a nightclub right beside the GPO. If legislation were in place, then what happened with the national monument in Moore Street might have been avoided. I accept the Minister’s remit concerns only national monuments but there has to be a role in deciding on the surrounding areas. That is where the problem is now and where local authorities come in. How much oversight does the Minister have with local development plans to ensure the aesthetics around national monuments?

Due to competition from other legislation, especially financial Bills, it has not made the progress I would have liked. It is now almost ready and we are going through the second draft. Hopefully, I will be able to introduce it in September. Then the Deputy will have an opportunity to make an input. As regards present planning guidelines, there are regional planning guidelines. Every local authority has a development plan which comes up for renewal every six years. My Department then has an opportunity to contribute to them. There is a list of protected structures for each county, as well as a strategic environmental assessment. I insisted several measures be taken before I gave permission for development around the national monument in Moore Street.

There is no way the Amsterdam authorities would allow a similar development to the one on Moore Street besides the Anne Frank house or the Polish authorities allow one besides Auschwitz. Like a Martin Luther King moment, I have a dream for Moore Street in which we have the national monument there with an appropriate surround of housing, bringing people back to live on the street, and small, craft-type, indigenous Irish small industries. If the Minister were the fairy godmother with the magic wand to the 1916 relatives committee, would he agree with that?

I have given the issue my consideration for more than three years and we have come up with a good solution to protect the national monument. There is, however, a broader issue relating to the site that is very much in the hands of the council and An Bord Pleanála. The Deputy should direct her attention to this broader issue.

Mar chuid den phróiseas sin, d'fhoilsigh mé tuarascáil anuraidh inar léiríodh an dul chun cinn foriomlán a rinneadh maidir le feidhmiú na straitéise idir 2010 agus 2013. D'fhoilsigh na Ranna Rialtais ábhartha - 11 acu san iomlán - a gcuid pleananna forfheidhmithe faoin straitéis ag an am céanna. Tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ag mo Roinn ar chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise ón uair a foilsíodh an tuarascáil anuraidh. Mar shampla, foilsíodh na critéir pleanála teanga i mí Mheán Fómhair 2013 agus na treoirlínte pleanála teanga i mí Eanáir 2014. Maidir leis na limistéir pleanála teanga Ghaeltachta, rinne mé na céad fhógraí faoin Acht i mí na Nollag 2013 chun tús a chur leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga i gCiarraí Thiar, i gCois Fharraige agus i nGaoth Dobhair, Rann na Feirste, Anagaire agus Loch an Iúir. Tá sé i gceist agam sé fhógra eile a dhéanamh go han-luath. Tá súil agam go ndéanfar é sin roimh dheireadh na míosa. Maidir leis na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta, tá próiseas comhairliúcháin ar siúl ag mo Roinn faoi láthair maidir leis na bailte is oiriúnaí a roghnú le bheith aitheanta faoin Acht. Maidir leis na líonraí Gaeilge, táthar ag súil go mbeidh Foras na Gaeilge ag fógairt scéim na líonraí Gaeilge sa dlínse seo níos moille i mbliana. Don chéad uair riamh, tá allúntas ar leith de €500,000 curtha ar fáil i mbuiséad mo Roinne i mbliana don straitéis. Tá leas á bhaint as an allúntas sin chun maoiniú a sholáthar do na heagraíochtaí pobalbhunaithe atá á roghnú ag Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana chun tabhairt faoin phleanáil teanga sna limistéir atá sonraithe; agus gníomhaíochtaí úra a mhaoiniú chun tacú le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise. Mar fhocal scoir, ní miste a lua go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise trí na struchtúir éagsúla, lena n-áirítear an coiste comhairleach a bhunaigh mé níos luaithe i mbliana chun comhoibriú níos fearr a chothú leis na heagraíochtaí ábhartha Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise agus an phróisis pleanála teanga.

Tá sé mar aidhm ag an straitéis go mbeidh níos mó teaghlaigh ar fud na tíre ag úsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga cumarsáide, go mbeidh úsáid na Gaeilge nó an Bhéarla mar rogha ag gach éinne agus go mbeidh daoine in ann a gcuid gnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Go háirithe, tá sé leagtha amach sa straitéis go mbeidh tacaíocht don Ghaeilge agus don litríocht ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht. An bhfuil aon cheann de na haidhmeanna sin bainte amach ag an Aire Stáit?

I mo thuairim, is próiseas measartha fada é seo. Glacfaidh sé am. Ar a laghad, táimid ag dul sa threo sin. Mar atá fógartha go dtí seo, nuair a bheidh an chéad fheachtas earcaíochta eile sa tseirbhís phoiblí ar siúl, cuirfear céatadán áirithe de na háiteanna ar fáil do dhaoine a bhfuil cumas Gaeilge acu agus a bheadh ábalta gnó a dhéanamh leis an bpobal trí Ghaeilge. Maidir leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta, mar a dúirt mé tá trí cheantar pleanála teanga - sna Gaeltachtaí ó thuaidh, ó thiar agus ó dheas - roghnaithe cheana féin. Déanfar sé chinn eile a roghnú gan mhoill taobh istigh de chúpla seachtain. Beidh naoi gcinn roghnaithe ag an tráth sin. Tá sé mar chuspóir againn go roghnófar trí cheantar eile roimh dheireadh na bliana. Ciallaíonn sé sin go mbeidh leath de na 26 ceantair Ghaeltachta ag obair ar phleanáil teanga. Mar atá ráite agam, tá airgead breise curtha ar fáil i gcáinaisnéis na bliana seo chun tacú leis na pobail sin a gcuid pleananna a chur i gcrích.

Ba mhaith liom roinnt cuspóirí eile sa straitéis a lua. Tá sé mar aidhm sa straitéis "an líon daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge gach lá lasmuigh den chóras oideachais a ardú ó 83,000 go 250,000"; "an líon daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht gach lá a ardú faoi 25%" agus "an líon daoine a úsáideann seirbhísí Stáit trí Ghaeilge agus atá in ann teilifís, raidió agus na meáin chlóite a rochtain tríd an teanga a ardú". Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit na ceisteanna sin, mar gheall ar an méid atá déanta i dtaobh na cuspóirí sin, a fhreagairt.

Cosúil le gach Teachta agus gach duine eile atá istigh anseo, bíonn mé ag plé leis na heagrais Stáit, ar nós na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim agus na Ranna eile, agus cloisim go minic "má tá fonn ort seirbhís a fháil trí Ghaeilge, brúigh Uimh. 4 nó Uimh 3". Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil go leor acu ábalta an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil i láthair na huaire. Tá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh le tamall anuas. An raibh ceist eile ag an Teachta?

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	Since last January I have been trying to obtain information on the use of unpaid interns by the national cultural institutions. Despite submitting several parliamentary questions and writing to the National Museum of Ireland, I am not much clearer on the issue. It is disappointing that I have had to submit this question to get a response from the museum. I was glad, however, to read in the letter I received last week that it was unable to proceed with the social media internship advertised in January. This is hardly surprising, given that it requires the intern to work 35 hours a week for six months without pay. Does the Minister consider it acceptable for the museum to request a person to work under these conditions?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I refer the Deputy to my replies to his previous questions, Question No. 30
on 6 March 2014 and Question No.15 on 17 April 2014, which were related to the same topic. As I outlined therein, while my Department provides funding for the national cultural institutions, including the National Museum of Ireland, the board of each institution is responsible for all operational matters, including recruitment and internship programmes, and I have no direct function in these matters. I understand the National Museum of Ireland has replied directly to the Deputy on this matter, indicating that it provides a range of internship opportunities on a regular basis in its marketing, education, collections and other areas. These internships are mainly provided for third level students who wish to gain practical experience and develop workplace skills relevant to their course and area of study. The museum has well established relationships with many universities and relevant third level institutions, both nationally and internationally, which place students with it. Applications from students are assessed on their individual merits and opportunities are provided in as many cases as possible. The museum assures me that all internships and work placements operate in a mutually supportive and complementary manner which assists it in achieving its goals and objectives, while ensuring a rewarding and beneficial experience for interns which can enhance their career opportunities.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	The museum states that these unpaid internships have been part of the museum landscape for decades. Does the Minister not agree that this type of arrangement contributes to a culture of elitism within the National Museum? Third level fees this year were €2,500 and by 2016 they will be €3,000. That is a lot of money for families, and most students take on part-time jobs to support their studies. It is bad enough to have these kids facing zero-hour contracts and poor working conditions, but the National Museum actually makes them work for nothing. Therefore, these internships can only be an option for people who are getting significant financial support from their families. Does the Minister think this does anything to help create a level playing field?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I am advised that the museum offered a social media internship earlier this year as a work placement for students studying marketing, arts and business. In the case in question, the successful intern would have been working with the museum's marketing department to gain workplace and hands-on experience in digital marketing and social media communications, as well as having the opportunity of developing ICT and organisational skills. As the museum did not have any established relationships with third level colleges in areas such as digital communications and digital media, the internship was discussed and promoted through DCU, which has courses in this area and whose students might have been interested, and also via the museum's website. There was, however, insufficient interest in the placement for it to proceed.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	Does the Minister not think that people doing this type of work should get at least the minimum wage? Students are struggling to make ends meet anyway, so very few students can avail of this opportunity of taking up the internship. With regard to my other question on the potential participation of the British royal family in the centenary commemorations in 2016, I would like to point out that I do not think we should pay homage to any monarchy. Does the Minister not think that the presence of a British royal would distract from what we should really be commemorating when 2016 comes around?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	That is a separate question.

If Deputy Wallace has issues with how it employs people then he should take the matter up directly with the board. I meet interns on a regular basis and they are delighted with the opportunity - and their families as well - to get experience. If they get experience it will obviously help them to find employment. My understanding is that in a number of cases, people who are taken on for a short-term contract or whatever are rewarded in different ways in those cultural institutions. The experience they gain is invaluable for them and for their future prospects.

They were designated 17 years ago, but to date a maximum of one eighth of those people can be accommodated by the actions that are being taken by the Department. Can I ask the Minister how long one must wait until people have realistic alternatives provided to them?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14 and 22 together. The Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network, published by my Department, provides details on future arrangements regarding turf cutting on each of the 75 raised bog natural heritage areas, NHAs. The review has concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured NHA network. This will entail the phasing out of turf cutting on certain NHAs by 1 January 2017 and the partial or complete de-designation of certain NHAs. To compensate for the loss of habitat within sites where it is proposed that turf cutting can continue, 25 undesignated raised bogs, which are currently in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure, will be designated as NHAs. These sites will be proposed for designation later this year, when all the necessary preparatory work which is under way at present is complete. Any turf cutter required to cease turf cutting on an NHA is being offered compensatory measures similar to those available to turf cutters from raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs. Such compensation will be available to qualifying persons with effect from 2014. A total of 2,959 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, introduced for raised bog SACs, have been received and acknowledged by my Department. Of these, 820 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs. Almost 4,600 individual payments have been made since the commencement of the scheme and more than 1,100 persons have signed legal agreements with my Department. Some €8.36 million has been spent to date on direct payments to turf cutters and on deliveries of turf. In addition, my Department has issued in the region of 250 compensation forms in relation to NHA sites, and 50 completed forms have been received. My Department has also received 129 permit applications in relation to category 1 NHA sites, resulting in 90 permits being issued to cut turf until the end of 2016. Five permits to cut turf have also been issued to contractors. Progress in relocating turf cutters is being achieved and is most advanced in those sites where turf cutters and their representatives have engaged with my Department in finding local solutions. In some sites, it has been difficult to progress arrangements, as representative groups have not engaged sufficiently to establish the requirement and preference for relocation amongst local turf cutters. Details of investigations to find potential relocation bogs are available on a site-by-site level in the draft national raised bog and SAC management plan, which can be viewed on my Department's website. Examples of progress in this area include the following: Clara bog SAC, County Offaly, where a group of 25 cutters were relocated; Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh bog SACs, County Galway, where a group of 23 cutters were relocated; Ballynafagh bog, County Kildare, where a relocation site was identified for a group of nine cutters; Moyclare bog SAC, County Offaly, where a group is to be accommodated on a relocation site from the 2015 season; Monivea bog SAC, County Galway, where three sites have been identified for possible relocation; and Mouds bog SAC, County Kildare, where a potential relocation site was identified for a group of at least 19 cutters. Sites assessed as suitable for relocation include Ardgraigue bog SAC, County Galway, Moanveanlagh bog SAC, County Kerry, and Redwood bog SAC, County Tipperary. I am advised that, of the remaining 43 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for 28, and work is ongoing on investigating site suitability. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for the remaining 15 raised bog SACs due, for example, to the small numbers cutting on these sites during the relevant five-year qualification period.

The reality is that in the vast majority of cases, potential relocation sites have not been found. While the Minister talked at length about the issue of compensation, as he will know, for the vast majority of genuine turf cutters the issue of compensation does not arise because all they want is to be able to continue to cut turf. On 28 January I asked the Minister when we would have the list of the further 25 NHA-designated sites. He told me on that occasion that public notices would issue shortly. It is now June and they have not issued. He has said it will be some time before the end of the year. When will people know what additional sites are to be designated?Second, in the light of the review carried out and the report published at the beginning of the year which clearly showed that some of the designations as NHAs were flawed and in the light of the fact that the Department has allowed 117 individuals to cut turf in Tullaher Lough SAC in County Clare, will the Minister now agree that we must review the complete ban on turf cutting in SACs and go back to the drawing board?

Ireland signed up to the habitats directive in 1992 and it was transposed into Irish law in 1997. A total of 53 SAC bogs were accepted by the Government and they were designated by 2004. After this, there was a type of moratorium in protecting these bogs and on my appointment as Minister I was faced with a legal case in Europe. The next step would have been taken in the European Court of Justice. There was no other option available and there could be no more procrastination, delaying or bluffing as the European Commission had run out of patience. We have made extraordinary progress in the past three years. I thank the people who are compliant with the law, despite being pressurised in many cases not to be so. They have accepted compensation. Relocation is proving to be challenging, but where there is co-operation, it is happening. I visited Clara bog and went to the relocation bog at Ballyhenry. Also, I compliment the leadership of former Deputy Paul Connaughton. Carrownagappul bog and Curraghlehanagh bog SACs have worked very well. A group of 23 turf cutters have been relocated and they are very happy with the bog to which they have been relocated. Despite the problems, this is working and we are making progress.

With regard to the Mouds and Ballynafagh bogs, to what extent have all traditional turf cutters been accommodated and are they satisfied with the outcome in both cases?

We have received a very encouraging response, with over 1,000 people responding. There are the reviews of NHAs and SACs. Having gathered the responses and with the co-operation of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, - I am glad that there was a recent meeting between the TCCA and my departmental officials - if there is total agreement, we can return to the European Union with a proposal that would include the changes to the NHAs. Although the NHAs are governed by Irish law, they are part of the overall package because some of them will be compensating for the loss of active raised bogs in the SACs for the past ten years. We can return to the European Union with a new package if this consultation takes place and there is agreement. This is still open for movement. There is still an opportunity for the Government, on behalf of the turf cutters, to go back to the European Union with proposals that are reasonable and obviously will be minimalistic in a sense. We are working on them, having received a large number of submissions in response to the three documents, particularly to two of them, that we issued for public discussion.

We have gone through another turf cutting season and that has not happened. People do not know what additional bogs are to be designated. I agree with the Minister that this issue is not of his making. Members of this House sat on their hands for 15 years prior to the Minister taking office. However, not being up-front and transparent with people is undermining any credibility that there is. Also, is it not the case that staff have abandoned their role in the relocation process because of the lack of support and resources within the Department to ensure they can source alternative bogs? If we are to build confidence between communities, this must be a priority and the resources of the Department must be put in place, 17 years on, to try to facilitate relocation.

I agree with him that they must know well before the next turf cutting season the 25 bogs that will be designated. There will be a public notice and there is a procedure to be gone through. There is also an appeals system. The notices will be issued. On that occasion I believe I confirmed that it would be towards the end of this year that the notices would be issued and that people would be informed. They will be informed. That was always to be the case. We are going through a major process and I pointed out that it would not happen before the summer. I simply could not give that commitment. However, it will happen in the autumn. People will be well informed and receive notice before the next turf cutting season. I accept the Deputy's point in that regard.

As regards referring back to Brussels, it would be futile unless there was agreement between the TCCA and everybody concerned. I am glad that a meeting took place recently between the TCCA and my officials. This matter can be resolved. It is difficult, as everybody knows, but we have made considerable progress. Where there is a genuine will and people are sincere that they wish to settle this matter which has been ongoing for too long, we can reach a solution. Good examples of how a solution has been achieved are working on the ground in the instances I mentioned. I hope that following the consultation we are undertaking and the responses we have received and with the TCCA and other interested groups, including the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, we can put together a package and refer back to Brussels under Article 6.4 of the habitats directive and make the case that there should be some accommodation for turf cutters in a very small number of cases where no relocation is possible. I have committed to doing this.

The Minister has told the House that he is prepared to revert in cases where an alternative is not available and make the case that in limited circumstances people would be allowed to cut turf. Is it not the case that we have ended up in the mess we are in because the Department's focus for the last 17 years has been on compensation and it was not focused on facilitating alternative bogs or allowing consent for turf cutting in the hard cases where alternatives were not available? Does the Minister acknowledge that and recognise that the lack of direction at senior ministerial level over those years has led to the debacle today?

As with so many other European issues, the matter was landed on the current Government's table. In this case, I was given the responsibility for resolving it. As the Deputy knows, I have worked very openly with people on this and made a great deal of progress. There is more progress to put into effect. Certainly, we are moving in the right direction and people are willing to co-operate as evidenced by the numbers who have accepted compensation. We have an opportunity in response to the number of people who have made submissions to put a package together in full consultation with the cutters and contractors and to revert to Brussels with a realistic proposal which has a chance of succeeding.

The Minister will agree that local authorities are well placed to deliver local centenary events, but they will need financial assistance to do so. Can the Minister clarify how funds will be made available and distributed?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17 and 23 together. Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the centenary anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising will be an important occasion in the public life of our nation and present a unique opportunity to remember the sacrifices made by past generations. The Government's priority concern has been to plan a number of significant capital projects to provide a lasting legacy of the centenary. At a time when resources were and are constrained, I am very pleased that capital funding has been made available for a number of key projects. An announcement of an allocation from stimulus funding of €22 million for 2015 was made on 13 May 2014. The flagship projects to be funded include the development of a permanent interpretive centre at the GPO; the digitisation and provision of a permanent home for the Military Service Pensions Archive; the development of visitor facilities at Kilmainham Courthouse; the conservation of Richmond Barracks; a tenement museum in Henrietta Street, and a visitor centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc. Significant refurbishment and development works are also to be carried out at the National Archives headquarters and at the National Concert Hall. Given the time required to complete these projects, the Government has accorded them priority with regard to the available funding for commemorations. I also welcome the many commemorative initiatives by national cultural institutions, local authorities, academic centres, ex-service organisations, community and history groups which have recently marked aspects of centenary history. I mention with particular appreciation the programme prepared by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in respect of the Dublin Lock-out. The possibility of funding of events and projects at community and local authority level will fall to be examined in future budgetary discussions. The Oireachtas all-party consultation group on commemorations has met on 19 occasions since February 2012. Keeping pace with the developing centenary programme, it was agreed last year that meetings should take place on a monthly basis. I can supply the dates if required. I have chaired 18 of these meetings, with the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley acting as chair of the only meeting I was unable to attend in December 2012. With the exception of one meeting held at Kilmainham Gaol, all meetings have taken place at Government Buildings in Dublin. The next meeting of the group is set for 24 June 2014. I am grateful for the interest and support of the members of the group. I realise there is considerable public interest and expectation regarding the events to commemorate the Easter Rising. The focus of this ceremony should be unequivocally on the memory of those who fought in the Rising. I have asked the all-party group for its views on the nature of the events that should take place on Easter Sunday 2016 and take the opportunity to invite any Member of the House to make a submission in this regard.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	I thank the Minister for his answer and acknowledge that he has a calendar of events to mark the centenary of 1916 which includes a number of capital projects for completion by Easter 2016. Does the Minister agree that funding needs to be made available to local authorities to ensure that communities across Ireland play a central role in commemorating 1916? It is essential that with under two years to go people in organisations are equipped and resourced to play a full part in these important centenary celebrations. Has the Minister engaged with his Assembly counterpart, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Carál Ní Chuilín, to discuss expanding the planned 1916 centenary events to ensure that they are all-Ireland in nature?

I quote Professor Diarmaid Ferriter who said:It would be naive to believe or expect that the current period of commemoration will not be affected by contemporary politics and coloured by who is in power; history illustrates that these have always been factors. Political capital has been made out of commemorations in the past and there has been political hijacking. The question of a royal presence has been raised and it must be addressed and discussed to ensure that the 1916 commemoration is not hijacked. We deserve a fitting and dignified tribute. To go back to what the Minister said about involving individuals and groups, educators must be included as well as a voice whereby people can give their views.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I agree with Deputy McLellan that local groups must get assistance for next year. There are a lot of plans. I hope to put a small fund in place to assist them. I have asked local authorities to assist local groups also. As I know from my own experience running small festivals, local groups can provide considerable value for money with a very small allocation. I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. I see no movements to date by anyone to hijack these events. The year 1916 belongs to all of us. Every political party in the Chamber can trace its origins back to 1916. It is very important that there is a very inclusive event of which everyone feels part. The nation must feel part of it and it must not be hijacked or monopolised by anyone. I agree with the Deputy. It is very much my philosophy as well and it informs how I have fulfilled my function as chairman of the commemorations committee. I have emphasised that the focus is on those who participated in the events of 1916, not anyone else. Certainly, that will be my vision for the 1916 commemoration. I thank the Deputy for her comments. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that community involvement will be very important, with an emphasis on the cultural side of 1916. I note the cultural movements which led to the leaders of 1916 being inspired to do what they did.That includes movements such as the Gaelic League, the GAA and others at the time that played a critical role in influencing people to make sacrifices on our behalf and to ensure we would be in this House today.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“ “authorised advocate” means an elected public representative, social worker, medical or legal professional or a representative of a tenants or housing rights body recognised by the local authority;”.I have tabled these amendments on the basis that many tenants who go to local authorities to be interviewed tend not to understand what is being said and do not have the ability to understand some of the things requested of them. We need a clearer picture on who can attend the local authority interview with the person concerned. I have included a number of suggestions, including a public representative, a social worker, a medical or legal professional or a representative of a tenant housing rights body recognised by the local authority. It is important that we have a clear picture on who is allowed to attend. Some local authorities are flexible, while others are not. If it is clearly stated these are the people who can listen to what is being said and represent the tenant, it will lead to greater understanding. That is the purpose of the amendments.

Deputy Dessie Ellis is correct in what he says. The people with whom we are dealing are often vulnerable and feel a need for support. They are frustrated by the system and, in many instances, believe this measure would be helpful. Deputies Dessie Ellis and Bernard J. Durkan may agree with me that, on rare occasions, we engage with local authority bodies and are told it might be better if a public representative did not get involved as the question of access to information arises. It would, therefore, be good if the Minister of State accepted this as an addition to the Bill to signal clearly to housing authorities that the idea of tenants or prospective tenants being supported in their engagement with local authorities could be part of the daily routine and was acceptable, provided that those supporting the prospective tenant fitted the categories outlined.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I support the amendment. When people arrive at the offices of the local authority, they are often in a state of crisis and require urgent solutions, some of which may not be forthcoming. As a public representative, I have found myself taking time to explain the scheme of letting priorities when I thought this would be automatic on meeting the local authority. I cannot recall one set of circumstances where this information was provided for the prospective tenants. The information makes them believe the system can operate in a fair manner. Some of this is related to the availability of staff in local authorities and the time pressure they are under. At such a time, having someone who is trusted to take the time to explain something would be good. I include advocates associated with the Citizens Information Service who are designated to deal on behalf of people with disabilities. They are often available, but people do not trigger the advocacy service when it is available to them and it should be brought to their attention.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I agree with the general tenor of the points raised by Members on the opposite side of the House. In recent years there has been a tendency for elected public representatives to remove themselves in knowing how the system works, the priorities set and the extent to which they can influence a satisfactory outcome. This has not been of assistance in the current housing crisis and the run-up to it in the past few years. There could have been greater knowledge in the hands of elected public representatives. There is a tendency for some local authorities to distance elected public representatives from the procedures used and the determination of letting priorities. This is to the disadvantage of potential tenants, the housing project and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which has overall responsibility. Ultimately, tenants believe they have no rights, including secondary rights. Some people have been excellent tenants and looked after a property well; others have not. Similarly, tenants have abused local authority property and would benefit from the advice of elected public representatives on what could be done to address the issues presented.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I can understand from where the amendments are coming, but I am concerned to ensure the local authority communicates well with tenants. My concern is that if there was a blanket requirement to permit a local authority tenant to have an authorised delegate in all dealings with the local authority, it could hinder and delay the normal process of landlord and tenant communications. In the majority of cases the tenants can handle the issue. I accept that the advice and assistance of public representatives and other voluntary organisations are helpful and this happens in practice. The problem I have with extending it in a formal way is that it would formalise the practice of bringing in someone every time a tenant dealt with a local authority. In practice, that would delay the process and depersonalise the communication. I would prefer to see local authorities improve their communication practices, where necessary. Some are excellent. It should become the norm that the local authority, as landlord, deals properly with tenants. My concern is that formalising the practice through these amendments would create an arrangement that would become the norm, delays communication and makes things more difficult rather than better for the majority of tenants.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	My amendment suggests this should be at the tenant's request. Some tenants understand what they are being told, but I have come across people who cannot even read or write. They go in to their local authorities and just sit and listen, but do not know what is going on. Practice is different across the local authorities and that is my concern. Nothing is defined. A public representative does not have to attend with a tenant if he or she does not feel comfortable. The same is true for anybody else and it is up to the individual whether to go or not. If the tenant wants somebody to accompany him, a person can be found within the confines of the groups we have outlined. The current situation in local authorities is all over the place. We need a more coherent system in terms of how we deal with tenants when conveying information to them on serious issues, which could lead to evictions. People in these situations must be made fully aware of all the ins and outs when it comes to what they are being told.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I appreciate the Minister of State has said it is the desire of every Minister and every Member to ensure that local authorities follow best practice and that if they do not follow it currently, they will establish it. However, the amendment put forward by Deputy Ellis proposes a tenant can "request" the presence of an authorised advocate. What in the name of God could be wrong with putting this into the legislation? Its inclusion would encourage best practice across the country. The only reason for refusing to include this provision, would be to facilitate the local authorities that do not want to engage with representatives or advocates on behalf of people who need assistance. That is the only reason this could be excluded. If it is part of best practice that those requesting assistance can bring that assistance with them and if the Minister of State refuses to include that in the legislation, she is de facto saying that she will not go along with developing best practice, because part of the agenda is to keep out elected Members or advocates and allow the local authorities to continue to deal with people, however vulnerable they may be, on a face to face basis.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I wish to add my support for this amendment. I do not see any reason the Government should refuse it. Sometimes when we are dealing with amendments, the default position of the Government seems to be "No", even when they are very sensible amendments. That default response should not apply to this sensible amendment. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the local authority does not generally resist any representation by me, other local representatives or other advocates. Many of the officials see the benefit of this because, for example, there are often issues of trust between the tenants and the local authority. It is important for these tenants to have a person they trust with them who can interpret what is being said and provide clarity in these often complex discussions about tenancies. For example, I am dealing with a case currently about succession of tenancy, which is labyrinthine in its complexity. The tenant feels he is being done over, but I do not believe the local authority is doing that. It is just that the case is complex. Having somebody there who can act as an independent reporter on events and who can clarify and interpret matters for the tenant can be helpful in trying to resolve the issues for all sides. Often there are huge issues of illiteracy, where people are just not able to read the forms or understand the complexity of the process, which is often bureaucratic. People need help in such cases. Another important reason for this amendment is that there are often disputes about what has been said in the aftermath of meetings, with people making claims and counter claims. Therefore, it is helpful if somebody has attended independently and has taken notes and can confirm what was said. I do not see what the problem is with this or why the Minister of State might refuse it. The amendment is eminently sensible. It does not make the provision of an advocate compulsory, but requires that it be agreed if the tenant feels he needs this support. In many cases they do need it. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	The fact the Minister of State has pointed out there is a variety of experience and that some local authorities are excellent, indicates some are not. For example, the in-house language used in this regard often needs to be interpreted. Some of this has to do with ensuring a uniform standard around the country. This may be an issue of training. There is also a vast difference in the ratio of staff to population in different areas. Let Meath and Limerick be taken as an example. In Meath, where there are approximately 30,000 extra people on authority lists, there are 620 staff. The combined Limerick local authorities have 1,075 staff. Clearly, if one has 400 extra staff and is dealing with a smaller population, one can provide a better service. This situation is replicated around the country. Therefore, sometimes there is a good reason staff around the country do not take the same approach. They simply do not have the time. The people who fall through the cracks in these situations are often those who are least able to cope with the bureaucracy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	These two amendments would enhance the Bill. We are talking here about possible terminations of tenancy and it could be argued that putting this kind of representation on a statutory basis in the general representation of people in dire need of housing would be inappropriate, because of the concern that unjustified or inappropriate preference might be given to one candidate over another on the housing list. However, in this case, we are talking specifically about terminations. My recent experience is that people are not aware of the dire housing situation that exists in the country currently in terms of acquiring a local authority tenancy and do not realise the deep and profound consequences were they to lose their tenancy under any of the provisions of section 2 of this Bill. In this context, the proposal put forward by Deputy Ellis is good and the Minister of State should consider including it in the legislation.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I support the amendment. I think it would be embarrassing if the Government did not accept this, which simply requests a facility for people to have an advocate. Some 24% of the people in my constituency are of non-Irish origin and a huge number of people on housing waiting lists are of non-Irish origin. These people have severe difficulties with language and also with accessing the bureaucracy of the local authority system. An increasing number of those with whom I come into contact are from African, eastern European and Asian backgrounds. These people need advocates. It should not be the case that advocates should be a councillor or Deputy. I am sure we all have enough to do. However, in some cases it must be one of these. The right to an advocate should be recognised as a right. I am sure advocacy is facilitated by many authorities, but perhaps not all.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The proposed amendment uses the term "A tenant in all dealings with a local authority" should have the right to an advocate. Therefore, we are talking about all dealings with a local authority, not just dealings relating to eviction. I agree we need good practice for all and if it is necessary for me to communicate more fully with local authorities with regard to this, I will do that. However, it is the duty of the local authorities to treat and deal with their tenants properly. In cases of illiteracy, language difficulties and complex legal issues, if a tenant wants an advocate, an advocate should be present.That is generally facilitated by all local authorities, in my experience. The difficulty with including it as a blanket requirement is that it will very quickly become the norm. Then people will think that unless they bring their doctor or lawyer along, somebody else will get treated better than them vis-à-vis a particular house or issue. That has happened in other areas whereby certain rights have become the norm. I would be concerned that this would affect the straightforward relationship between the landlord and tenant, the landlord in this case being the local authority. By and large, meetings can take place without the presence of others being necessary. Indeed, having to arrange the presence of another could be problematic too - does the tenant find the advocate or is there an obligation on the council to do so? How much additional time would that take? I am concerned at the practicalities of this and am reluctant to put into statute a provision giving tenants the right to an advocate in all dealings with a local authority. I am concerned that it is going too far and will, to some extent, tie the process up in knots and make it more difficult. Sometimes a number of meetings with the local authority will be necessary on a particular issue and I believe it is impractical to put this into the legislation.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I wish to press my amendment because I do not accept what the Minister of State has said. As has been outlined by Members here, there are serious issues involved. Deputy Coppinger made reference to non-Irish nationals but the issues are not confined to that cohort of the population. Issues such as eviction and anti-social behaviour are very serious. In many cases, people could be facing very serious difficulties and a code of practice is needed. I do not accept the Minister of State's argument because the amendment makes provision for an advocate only when one is requested by the tenant and not all tenants will make such a request. This is so serious. People must know the full implications but many do not - that is the reality. That is why I am pressing this amendment. We must have a code.

The difficulty applies to all of us who work with local authorities. Certainly in the north inner city I have seen the effects of particular individuals who have been involved in serious antisocial behaviour, usually involving drugs and drug dealing. There is violence and we have had assaults and murders. I sympathise with local authorities which are trying to deal with this. Sometimes, however, other tenants do not see the local authorities moving quickly enough to address the matter. However, we have to balance that with the necessary supports for vulnerable people when they are dealing with accusations of anti-social behaviour. The purpose of the amendment is to insert a measure that would add to the supports in place. It would mean the local authority would have to include external contacts on the letter of warning. External contacts such as community law centres, legal aid organisations and the Citizens' Information Board, or housing charities such as Focus Ireland, could provide support. We are keen to ensure that everything is done so that eviction is not the recourse taken. The measure also allows for the necessary balance to push the local authority to move more quickly. Anyway, every attempt should be made to try to support people so that it does not get to that point. Including these measures in the legislation would also reinforce the welfare teams who are working on this, and it would be a reinforcement for the local authority as well. Furthermore, it would mean that when a case goes to the District Court the court could measure the level of engagement. It will not always work, but if engagement has occurred honestly and positively then it could be important.

I am adding it to the existing procedures of housing authorities to help them to deal with instances of anti-social behaviour in their housing stock. It is part of the ongoing communication, but it has a specific purpose. The purpose of a tenancy warning is to inform a tenant that a condition of his or her tenancy agreement prohibiting anti-social behaviour has been breached, to require the tenant to take steps to prevent a continuation or recurrence of such behaviour and to warn the tenant of the consequences if the breach of the tenancy agreement is repeated. The problem is that a statement of supports available to tenants is not appropriate in a statutory warning that a tenant receives concerning behaviour and that could lead to termination of his or her tenancy agreement. Certainly, the housing authority should and does, in its capacity as a social landlord, provide all appropriate assistance to a tenant when dealing with a household member engaged in anti-social behaviour. This should be done through the many contacts available other than the tenancy warning. The tenancy warning has the specific purpose of telling the people concerned that they are in breach. It is more appropriate in the context of other communications from the local authority.

The Minister may by regulations prepare a code of conduct on the management of rent arrears by housing authorities.".This amendment relates to the issues raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in amendment No. 3. When the general scheme of the Bill was being drafted, it was put to me by the Northside Community Law Centre in my constituency that a statutory basis for a code of conduct along the same lines as that enjoyed by tenants in Northern Ireland would be advantageous. The code in the North is voluntary and covers rent arrears and other situations in which tenancies may be endangered. The Minister of State might point to Part 2 of the Bill, under which indications can be given to people regarding the conduct of their tenancies, and there are induction meetings for new tenants in the two local authority areas with which I am most familiar, namely, Dublin city and Fingal, but there is merit in the proposal that the Minister's office have a specific power to establish a code of conduct to which all local authorities would have to adhere and that would serve as a basis for the provision of information and support for tenants. As mentioned during the debate on previous amendments, many householders in Dublin city who fall into rent arrears cannot be considered for transfers. They must have clear rent accounts for six months. There are major consequences if one is in breach of any aspect of one's basic tenancy agreement. A code of conduct on rent arrears would allow for the adoption of a consistent national approach. As I mentioned on Second Stage and has been stated by other Deputies, another lacuna in the Bill is in the management of rent arrears by voluntary housing bodies. That the voluntary housing sector still does not have a modern legislative basis is a significant problem for tenants. Many Deputies, particularly those representing Dublin city and Fingal, have encountered instances of greatly varying behaviour on the part of voluntary housing bodies in their management of tenants in rent arrears or experiencing other difficulties. A submission was made on this matter when the general scheme was being drafted. This issue might be considered.

Broughan's proposal which makes good sense for local authorities and the country's many voluntary housing associations. In County Kildare rent collection for the local authority is conducted by its revenue collectors who were previously rate collectors. While they do a good job and are, in all instances, supportive of the tenants with whom they deal, I am unaware of any particular training they have received in dealing with tenants who are facing extreme financial difficulties and major challenges in paying the variety of bills that come their way. One is often approached by families after they have accrued significant arrears. This is also the case in the voluntary housing sector. I must declare an interest in that I am a director of and involved in quite a number of such bodies in County Kildare. It would be good to have a national policy on best practice for local authorities and voluntary housing associations, the principal purpose of which would be to strive to prevent a situation from developing in which people would find themselves in significant arrears. When some people arrive at the point where they owe many thousands of euro to local authorities or voluntary housing associations and solicitors' or warning letters from their housing providers threaten them with eviction or legal proceedings, they do not engage for a considerable period. When they do, they will agree to practically anything, but these agreements are often broken because they are unreasonable in the first instance. People who are under pressure and believe they will have to surrender their tenancies will agree to practically anything, often to amounts that are beyond their capacity to pay. Further amendments will address this issue in terms of making deductions at source, but the Minister of State would be doing the nation some service if she and her Department devised a strategy that could be advocated to all local authorities and voluntary housing associations under which the accumulation of arrears could be minimised and a standardised approach to dealing with arrears implemented. The amendment is trying to achieve this and is worthy of support.

Broughan's amendment. We all know that different local authorities have different codes on rent arrears. In many cases, the codes depend on the individuals working in their rent sections. Often, people who are added to the list suddenly find themselves facing significant arrears because it is discovered they should have been paying more. We need to address these issues in a proper fashion. People across the board have seen their debts added to considerably and a proper code needs to be in place. It is difficult that we must rely on the whims of individuals in local authorities. That their codes can vary so much means that there is something to Deputy Thomas P. Broughan's argument.

Many children are being brought up by grandparents because of their parents' addiction. The grandchildren have grown into adulthood in their grandparents' local authority flats and houses. When a grandparent dies, the grandchild faces a difficulty because his or her needs are not matched by the housing provided. Such persons have had to deal with not having their parents; therefore, there is a need for flexibility. This suggestion could be covered by the proposal made in the amendment.

I do not know how a code of conduct would be different from guidelines - they are pretty much the same. The guidelines deal comprehensively with the various aspects of rent management through rent assessment, collection and accounting and place the emphasis on rent arrears prevention and recovery. As I understand it, they are applied by all local authorities.I can certainly remind them if there is any question that they are not being applied. A number of issues were raised. As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl said, we deal with the issue of direct deduction later in the Bill. We are trying to put in a system that will manage people paying their rent on a regular basis and not falling into arrears. I hope that will address problems that might arise in the future. What is in place is designed to be reasonable and not impose too much hardship on people who owe a considerable amount of money for one reason or another, and to take it back over a period of time. The main point I would make is that there are guidelines and I do not know that a code of conduct would necessarily be any different from the guidelines in place already. We can examine the guidelines to see if they need to be changed or reviewed in any way. Deputy O'Sullivan raised a somewhat separate issue in so far as it is about the tenancy rather than anything to do with rent arrears, but issues of tenancy can be difficult. We discussed succession tenancies on Second Stage and whether people should have rights even if they are not on the original tenancy but I do not believe we can deal with it specifically under this item.

By which legislation are they governed? I was reflecting a view that there should be a transparent national code to which local authorities would adhere. The Minister mentioned aspects of the management of rents by local authorities. The area of assessments, for example, is an area about which many public representatives would have concern. In Dublin city in particular people would be of the view that figures were plucked out of thin air, so to speak. Officials might have had some basis for figures, particularly with adult children, changing family memberships and so forth, but sometimes it is very difficult to see a coherent policy in the assessment area. My experience is that virtually all major rent arrears cases I have represented had to do with assessment. On foot of assessments people had been paying their rents. There is a need for greater transparency in the area and the Minister might indicate the legislative basis for the current system and whether it would be advantageous to include it in this Bill.

The Minister has expressed the view that there are guidelines in place and that local authorities are implementing them. The reality is that if the practice is enshrined in legislation, it will have far more effect in local authorities than it is having by virtue of simply being a guideline that is issued to them. I envy the position the Deputy appears to have in north County Dublin where arrears only arise in situations where assessments are done. My experience is that arrears arise solely because people have not been paying their rent, and that is a real difficulty. For such people there must be urgent early intervention to address that issue because the longer the problem goes on, the more difficult it is for that problem to be solved. People who get into significant arrears in those circumstances are under pressure and they will make unrealistic commitments in terms of the moneys they say they will pay. The approach of the local authority will be to say that the tenant has been in arrears and that he or she entered into an agreement which he or she has now broken when the reality is that the tenant would never be able to keep to the terms of the agreement in the first instance. The point is not unrelated to the earlier point made by Deputy Dessie Ellis. In engagements with the local authority there is often a need for the tenant who goes into such circumstances to be accompanied by someone who will be able to tell them not to promise to pay an additional €30, €40 or €50 per week when the reality is that they do not have a hope in hell of paying that and that it would be much better to pay an extra €5, €10 or €15 a week and be able to honour that commitment in the long term and reduce their arrears. If what is in place is not working effectively, will the Minister at least look at putting this into the legislation so it can be given added strength?

It is a major issue, and my colleague is right that it should be dealt with at an early stage. All of us as public representatives have been contacted by people in local authority houses. In the last case I dealt with recently the rent arrears were in excess of €12,000. The arrears should not have been allowed get to that stage and there is no possibility of the tenants paying back that amount of money. What local authorities try to do when one goes in to negotiate with them is get the tenant to pay the rent they were supposed to pay, plus an extra €50 or €60, when the reality is that they cannot pay what they originally agreed to pay. When one raises this issue with the local authorities the first comment they make is that they do not have the staff to deal with rent arrears, particularly in large local authorities which have a huge number of tenants. I agree with the previous speaker that some system should be put in place to identify problems at the outset. A representative could go in with the tenant who should be let pay what they can afford. The local authority could monitor their circumstances and if they change, the rent can be increased to what they can afford to pay and not allow the arrears rise to €10,000 or €12,000 by which time the tenants are not in a position to pay such an astronomical amount.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I agree with some of the previous speakers. The ability to write off debt varies in local authorities. That is an important area because some people simply cannot afford to pay. Local authorities have added to the problem by allowing arrears to build up. If an authority has allowed arrears to build up, should it not be punished in some way or does the tenant have to pick up on the fact that the local authority did not cop on that someone was on the tenancy for which they were not being paid despite all the relevant information being put forward? We need to have codes of practice. I accept there are rules, and most local authorities are fairly reasonable, but I have found on occasion that the process is not working the way it should do. I support Deputy Broughan.

That will be dealt with for the future. With regard to the issue around assessments, the new rent schemes will be adopted by the new councils next year and we will be providing clarity on how they assess who is and is not on the tenancy in regard to those schemes. On the specific point about the legislation with regard to guidelines, it is section 5 of the 2009 Act that deals with the guidelines.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	Last Friday, I read in The Irish Times about an extraordinary letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to party colleagues in relation to a number of matters. Principally, the letter stated that the Minister of State would not stand over a Taoiseach firing a Garda Commissioner without so much as a phone call to the leader of the Labour Party. That is a very serious assertion by a Government Minister. Has the Taoiseach spoken to Deputy White about that assertion and does he agree with what he said about the removal of the Garda Commissioner? I have been asking for ten weeks for a candid and truthful account from the Taoiseach in regard to the reason he sent the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the home of the Garda Commissioner on that fateful Monday evening prior to the Cabinet meeting, which in itself was an unprecedented move and which sources close to the former Garda Commissioner say left him in no doubt and with no option in regard to what was expected by the Taoiseach. This is a serious issue. The process to be followed with regard to the departure of a Garda Commissioner is laid out in law. The Garda Commissioner can only be removed by the Cabinet. Essentially, the Taoiseach set in train a series of events to remove the former Garda Commissioner without telling the Tánaiste or his Cabinet colleagues.
The Minister of State, Deputy White, has confirmed and said what the public believe to be the truth. For some reason, the Taoiseach will not come into this House and tell the truth and be candid with us as to the actions he took. This is a serious issue that goes to the very core of faith in the public service.

I put on the record that it was my duty and my responsibility to have those concerns brought to the attention of the former Garda Commissioner because I would have to inform the Cabinet the following morning of those concerns and anxieties.

This was about the wider issue of phone recordings at Garda stations, about which the Taoiseach claims he was so concerned.

The Deputy will be aware that the Government has established a commission of inquiry, the sole member of which is a Supreme Court Justice who has authorisation, as requested by the committee on justice, which includes representatives of Fianna Fáil, to make decisions relevant to the commission, including its terms of reference. The exact wording is there. I have a duty, as have others, to respond to that. Perhaps, in view of his own revelation, Deputy Martin might be required to be candid about who told him that, in view of the fact that the Cabinet was not informed until I called them together on the morning that I should have.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	Ní leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh gan ciúnas mar tá ceist dáiríre agam. Last week in the absence of the Taoiseach I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, whether he was aware that the founder and 50% shareholder of a private consultancy firm, The Health Partnership, had been appointed by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, as chairperson of the West/North West Hospitals Group, a major State public health body. I put it to the Minister for Finance that a major player in the private health sector who promoted the privatisation of health services was being appointed as chairman of a major public health body and that there was clearly a conflict of interest. Once again, I called the judgment of the Minister for Health into question. The Minister for Finance was not able to answer my question. He said he had not been briefed on the issue. Therefore, I would like to direct my question at the Taoiseach. This is one of a litany of calamities over which the Minister for Health has presided. The Taoiseach might be aware that the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, has highlighted that he has received many complaints about discretionary medical cards but that when he was trying to investigate the issue, he was told the original files on the basis on which decisions were made about citizens' entitlement to a discretionary medical card were not available. He said it was almost impossible for his office to adjudicate on complaints made to him. Will the Taoiseach clarify what happened to the files? Why are they not available? The Government claimed to have conducted a review of discretionary medical cards. How could it have done so if the files were not available?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	I am not sure about the Deputy's last question.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	My last question concerns the fact that the Ombudsman is saying the original files used to make decisions on discretionary medical cards are not available. He says he has no explanation for this and that he has not been able to get one. This flies in the face of the Government's claim that it is conducting a review of medical card issues. How can it conduct such a review if the files are not available? The Taoiseach should not miss my question on an individual from a private consultancy firm being appointed as chairman of a major State public health body. Will he clarify what happened to the files mentioned by the Ombudsman? Why are they not available?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	I do not know why they are not available. Obviously, we have had arguments and discussions in the House about the medical card system in the past couple of months. The Deputy is aware that for many years the system for allocating medical cards was based on income and that discretion applied where undue hardship was affecting the circumstances of any individual. Discretion was exercised, depending on one's circumstances. The Minister for Health has put in place a clinical panel to examine how medical cards might be given to people based on medical circumstances, with conditions attached. I do not know why the papers to which the Ombudsman referred are not available. The law never changed all along in using income as a basis for the allocation of medical cards and in respect of the system under which a medical card could be granted to an applicant whose income was over the limit in circumstances of undue hardship. I will have the matter checked for the Deputy, but I cannot answer his question. I do not know why the papers are not available. There has been no change in this regard since the 1970s, which is why we are moving towards an examination of the issue by a clinical panel of experienced personnel. On the other matter mentioned, it is a serious issue. The matter is being dealt with seriously by the Minister for Health. Obviously, he wants to deal with it quickly.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	The Taoiseach has stated this is a serious issue and that it is being dealt with seriously by the Minister for Health.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	163	He is the person who appointed the head of a private consultancy firm that advocates the privatisation of health services as chairman of a public health body. Therefore, I do not believe the Taoiseach's answer is adequate, nor do I believe the answer on the missing files is adequate. The Ombudsman has said that what happened to the files is something his office has not been able to establish. All he knows is that they are no longer available. He has stated his office cannot cast any light on where the files are and what happened to them and that they are simply no longer available. His office does not know when, why or how they went missing. The change in the Government's attitude in the days before the election was indicative of contrition. Labour Party and Fine Gael Ministers talked about how they were getting it in the neck over how the Government was not dealing with the issue of medical cards properly. That was on 23 May, a long time ago. Despite this, the Taoiseach is not aware that the very files in which some of the decisions are supposed to have been recorded have gone missing. This is not good enough. Every Member of the Oireachtas knows how individuals, including children with unchangeable medical conditions and children with terminal illnesses, have had their medical cards taken from them. What happened to the contrition shown on 21 and 22 May? What we now have is a Government that is moving from one calamity to another. I note that the Taoiseach was not able to give me an adequate answer in this Chamber on either of my questions, one being on the appointment of the head of a private health consultancy as chairman of a public health body and the other being on medical cards.

Files on individual medical cards should not be lost, as I am sure they are not. I do not understand why they are not available to the Ombudsman who has an independent role and authority. I hope it is not a case of files having disappeared and it not being possible to retrieve them and make them available to an independent authority such as an ombudsman, as one would expect, when he has to make a decision on a legitimate case. We will find out the answer. The Deputy is telling me I am supposed to know all of these details.

He visited an array of media and technology companies, including Facebook, Cisco and eBay. We acknowledge the work of the Government in attracting investment, employment and growth, but there is another side to the coin. One aspect concerns Irish workers, while the other concerns Ireland's reputation. Multinationals come here and avail of tax breaks and concessions and then head for the hills. They either close down their businesses completely or reduce their numbers of employees. We have a list of the companies that during the years have done exactly what I describe. Others are planning to take a similar approach. We have noticed the increasing demands being placed on Irish workers which is epitomised by what is happening to workers in Waterford.It is not so much a case of take it or leave it; it is a case of take it or we leave. We know the kind of aggressive lobbying that is going on to get that firm to move to New York. We see the erosion of hard-won workers' rights because of these companies in terms of salary and wages, health and safety, and other conditions. The editorial in the Irish Examiner put it very succinctly, stating: "Globalisation ruining workers' job security". We have to ensure we get worthwhile employment that is not subject to the whims of foreign multinational companies and foreign investment. One of the strategies and answers is to give greater support to small and medium businesses. The statistics show they are the ones who are more reluctant to let their employees go in difficult times. That means tackling the issues they have identified as being difficulties, for example, access to adequate finance, sustainable cash flow, upward-only rents, microfinance, seed capital schemes and the public procurement issue. Will the Government commit to the same assertive or aggressive measures it uses to attract foreign direct investment and multinationals on behalf of the small and medium enterprises here? It is the small and medium enterprises - our indigenous industries - that have our workers' interests at heart. Will the Government commit to a series of events comparable to the St. Patrick's Day events which go towards attracting foreign investment in order to support our small and medium enterprises?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	Hear, hear. That is a sensible suggestion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	Deputy O'Sullivan's question is very valid and I thank her for her comments. The Industrial Development Authority, for very many years, has been a global model for structuring a situation where foreign direct investment into this country has continued to be very strong. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, as trade policy Minister, have had a direct impact on this. I do not accept the multinationals come here and head for the hills shortly afterwards. This morning, for example, Hollister announced an €80 million investment in Ballina, and it has been there for 40 years; Allergan, which has been here the same length of time, has invested €300 million in Westport, and there are many others. It is true to say that the nature of the products manufactured in many of these plants has changed over the years and there have been changes in technology, in robotics and in the way things are done. Multinationals employ over 100,000 people here, with a massive investment in IT, pharmaceutical, software and many other areas. I want Deputy O'Sullivan to understand that a priority of Government is really to focus on job creation through the SME sector. That is why Silicon Valley Bank, the Chinese Investment Corporation and KfW, the state investment bank from Germany, are putting together €4 billion in a couple of years for investment in regard to access to credit for small and medium enterprises, including the schemes the Deputy has mentioned. Some 20 SMEs from Ireland were in San Francisco at the weekend, pitching for venture capital investment, and these SMEs had gone through a boot camp here, where their presentations were taken asunder and reconstructed so they would be made in the strongest possible fashion. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is in Switzerland today with up to 60 companies from Ireland, small and medium enterprises pitching for business and new markets. I agree with the Deputy in regard to job creation and growing the economy for the future. The emphasis of the Minister through the Action Plan for Jobs, through the Pathways to Work scheme and through access to credit from new sources is to do exactly what the Deputy says, namely, make opportunities for small and medium enterprises to build on their potential. Enterprise Ireland, as an equivalent model of the IDA, has been exceptional in terms of the assistance, time, effort and creativity with which it works with companies so jobs can be created here in Ireland. Its fund, through high potential start-ups and so on, is very focused. While we cannot cover the entire range of opportunities, the ones where we see real potential get real priority and focus from Government. The Deputy's question is valid. Some 60,000 jobs were created last year and 40% of those were created by companies that are less than five years old, so those frontiers up ahead are changing. Deputy O'Sullivan can take it from me that the focus and emphasis of Government is genuinely on small and medium enterprises and giving them that opportunity to grow their potential and create jobs here at home. It is then all about economic confidence.

We know the printing industry in this country has been decimated in recent years, with an estimated loss of some 5,000 jobs. I want to move to another aspect, namely, Ireland's reputation, which brings in the tax issue. I believe multinationals' idea of social responsibility equals more profit for their shareholders. How do they get more profit for their shareholders? They pay their workers less and they pay less tax. We know that multinationals are very adept at very aggressive forms of tax avoidance, channelling revenue through subsidiaries, including, unfortunately, through countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, with the various techniques they use, including the "Double Irish" and "Dutch Sandwich". Ireland has been a voice internationally against illicit flight capital from the countries of the developing world but we have to lead by example. We have to co-operate with what the OECD and the European Commission are doing. The OECD is calling on all G20 states to implement the 15-point guideline in its action plan in regard to base erosion and profit shifting. I want to know whether the Government will confirm which key aspects of that plan it will be implementing and whether it will ensure multinationals comply so Ireland does not facilitate tax avoidance by multinational companies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	The wages on average in IDA companies in Ireland are much higher than elsewhere in the economy. Survivorship among multinational companies is as strong as it is in Irish companies although, obviously, markets change and there are pressures all of the time. Ireland's spend on Irish companies is actually much higher than it is in respect of multinationals. It is not one or the other, it is not either-or - we need both. Obviously, multinationals being here creates opportunities for niche contractors to supply services and goods to them, which is very important. In respect of base erosion and profit shifting, we have been very much up-front about this. In the budget last October the Minister abolished the stateless concept. Clearly, there is an international issue here in respect of the digital world having moved very much ahead of the legislative world. That is why Ireland, among other countries of the European Council and the EU, has been very much up-front in working with the European Commission and the OECD to deal with this in an international way, so there is an international response to the issue. The different sectors are represented and the many committees are attended and contributed to by Ireland. We hope the OECD will bring forward its report during the summer and, as I have said, Ireland is very much up-front in wanting this matter to be dealt with in an international sense. This is not about the rate of corporation tax. It is about the issue of tax in general.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	I have read the Department of Finance's response to the decision of the European Commission to open a formal inquiry into a number of individual EU member states, particularly in respect of the application of rulings or opinions relating to a particular multinational company that has been in Ireland for well over 30 years and that at times employs up to 3,000 people. We need a comprehensive debate in this House on industrial policy, foreign direct investment and how we attract it because the narrative has gone askew somewhat. We need a very clear national position vis-à-vis the European Commission and European policy makers and Ireland's competitiveness and that of the EU vis-à-vis other countries like Singapore which spare no effort in terms of the armoury they put together to attract industry. In essence, we are competing against them. Some companies may go but many stay. Apple has been in Cork for well over 30 years, has gone through many changes and has employed over 3,000 people. It is a matter of concern to real people. These are real bread-and-butter issues for workers that the Houses of the Oireachtas need to interrogate. There are many other companies that the Taoiseach visited, including pharmaceutical and electronic companies. We need to be clear and not just pander to the latest fad about a given issue or company because it is critical to the future of the country and good quality employment. 
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	We are on the Order of Business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	Is the Government prepared to give decent Government time for a comprehensive debate on this issue involving foreign direct investment and multinationals but also SMEs? Let us have a genuine and open debate about where the country should go on this. We need to be far more assertive and robust in the EU than perhaps we have been to date.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	I think the Deputy has made his point.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I had the privilege of opening the expansion of the Apple plant in Cork recently. It is a fabulous entity employing many thousands of people who have been there for many years, as Deputy Martin noted. I met with the principals of Apple last week in California. They have been very happy with their productivity, track record and the workforce in Cork and want to be there for very many years. We have a very clear and strong position that is evidenced by the strength of the foreign direct investment line coming to the country. I have no objection to a debate here on industrial policy on which we have a very clear and robust position. As the Deputy is aware, it is based on talent, technology, track record and our tax position. We will defend that in any quarter and are defending it very strongly where that is necessary. It is proving to be a very successful process in terms of the outcome because of development, expansion and jobs. Of course, we can have a comprehensive debate on industrial policy but we have a very clear and robust position articulated by the Minister on so many occasions internationally and we will defend that. We can make arrangements for the Whips at the appropriate time to have a comprehensive debate, which I would welcome.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	I have two questions for the Taoiseach. The first is about the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014. The Taoiseach knows that the Minister for Health began drafting this legislation a year ago. Its aim of cutting the annual death toll from smoking-related diseases to 5,200 is commendable and deserves the support of people across society. I understand that the Minister brought it to the Cabinet yesterday. When will the Bill be published, when does the Taoiseach expect it to be placed before the Dáil and when does he expect it to be passed into law? My other question is about the Ballymurphy massacre. Dúirt an Taoiseach tamall ó shin go raibh sé tiománta rún uile-pháirtí a bhunú ar shléacht Bhaile Uí Mhurchú agus ba mhaith liom ceist a chur air faoi sin inniu. Mar is eol dó, dúirt Rialtas na Breataine nach raibh sé chun fiosrúchán a bhunú maidir le marú 11 duine i mBaile Uí Mhurchú i 1971. Ceithre seachtain ó shin, mar fhreagra ar cheist a chuir mé chuig an Taoiseach ar an ábhar seo, gheall sé rún a dhréachtú agus a chur i láthair dúinn. An bhfuil aon dul chun cinn déanta maidir le seo agus cathain a bheidh an rún seo os comhair pháirtí de chuid an Fhreasúra? Cathain a bheidh an téacs os comhair na Dála?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	I expect that the Bill with regard to plain packaging for tobacco products will be published at the end of this week and will go to the Seanad next week. Chuir an Teachta ceist orm faoi fhiosrúchán ag éirí as marú a tharla i mBaile Uí Mhurchú blianta fada ó shin. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an rún sin curtha le chéile agam don chéad seachtain eile agus beidh mé i dteagmháil le cinnirí an Fhreasúra maidir le sin.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	My question concerns the adoption (information and tracing) Bill. In light of the ongoing controversy around the horrific events at mother and baby homes and in particular the scandal of children being taken from their mothers for adoption, it is clear from the survivors that there is a significant gap in the availability of information for children who want to locate their mothers. This Bill would put in place a process to make this possible. It was due for publication in 2013. That deadline has passed. Has the Department completed the heads of the legislation? When will these be placed before the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and when will the Bill be published?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	This legislation has been around and talked about for a while. It is a very complex matter. There are constitutional requirements here relating to privacy and it would appear that a referendum will be required in respect of some of the privacy issues involved here. There are amendments being worked on that are very complex and have constitutional implications but I will inform the Deputy of the current state of play. It is not as simple as it looks. Obviously, the interdepartmental group is now looking at the range to be dealt with by the commission of investigation to be set up by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. This will be part of that study but believe me, it is not as simple as it looks.

I do not want to show a preference. They hit the line together. It was a photo finish.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	Last week in the Taoiseach's absence on what I am sure is very important national business, we debated yet another Social Welfare Bill. The Taoiseach will be interested to know that on the first day that Second Stage of that Bill was taken, I received a communication from the Whip's office asking me to put forward amendments because the amendments were being debated at 1 p.m. The Taoiseach will be aware that there is a direct commitment in the programme for Government to allow at least a fortnight for a period of reflection between Second Stage and Committee Stage of legislation. The Government is at least 75% through its lifetime and it is still shunting legislation through in this fashion.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	I think the Deputy has made his point.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	Social welfare arises at different times. They try to keep the two-week gap mentioned by the Deputy. I do not think it never happens with social welfare but it is different from a normal Bill because there are timelines and payments to be made. I regret if the Deputy is upset about it. The barrage last year used to be about Bills being guillotined. We have not had any of that. I take the Deputy's point but social welfare is a different kind of Bill.

I refer to another issue that I have highlighted previously, the harm associated with alcohol misuse and the effects on society. Recent reports show we have the largest binge drinking population in Europe. We are all aware of the problems associated with alcohol. When will the public health (alcohol) Bill be brought before the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	There are two alcohol-related Bills: one relating to public health and the other to the sale of alcohol. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, is working on them. He might be distracted at the moment by something else, but I will bring the Deputy up to date on when they might be produced.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	207	I wanted to refer to the sale of alcohol Bill, but the Taoiseach has referred to it.

Will it address serious allegations about the construction programme in the education, health and transport sectors and public procurement whereby significant numbers of the workforce working on the projects are black economy workers from another jurisdiction? They come from another jurisdiction which perhaps is part of our nation but not part of the jurisdiction; they are effectively working in the black economy on projects which were tendered for through the public procurement process. Would the Taoiseach have a concern if these allegations were true?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	We do not deal with concerns on the Order of Business.

Deputy Catherine Murphy, for example, raised them with him on the Order of Business. We were anxious about a downturn in the rate of increase and there was concern about what was causing the downturn. Could it have been caused by something in the construction industry? Will the Taoiseach investigate the issue?

Will it be passed before the end of the year? What is the position on the geothermal energy Bill which has a similar association?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	It will be passed before the end of the year. The 2020 targets set for Ireland were the consequence of a flawed methodology which has left the country with a difficult position to reach. The targets to be set for 2030 will need to be the subject of robust discussion because one would not wish to saddle the country from 2020 onwards with-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	217	Bank debt.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	-----exorbitant fines which are the consequence of a false methodology. That is an issue of concern for everybody. For instance, agriculture is an important sector for us. The target should been +4 instead of -20, an extraordinary difference based on a flawed methodology.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	I refer to three issues regarding legislation. First, does the Minister for Finance intend to make regulations under a statutory instrument relating to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012? Section 20(6) permits the Minister to make regulations to allow local authorities to reduce or increase the local property tax by a 15% margin. Will he make such a regulation in order that local authorities can carry this out and notify Revenue of the change before the deadline at the end of September? Second, agreement on a direct recapitalisation instrument at European level was announced yesterday. Member states will have to give effect to their own national procedures. What is proposed for Ireland? Must the Government introduce legislation to allow for the bailing out of banks when they fall into trouble and provide for the use of the direct recapitalisation instrument? Given that the instrument has been agreed at that level, have negotiations formally started on its retroactive application in order that we can get our money back? The third issue is political reform. As a member of the banking inquiry team, I am deeply disappointed by what is happening in the Seanad. It will put the inquiry back by a number of months. An intervention is needed to stop the squabbling and bickering. Sinn Féin is excluded from all of the committees which are dealing with the issue, including the Committee of Selection and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The public wants this to stop and the committee to be up and running as quickly as possible.  On political reform, it was announced when the Government took office that it would facilitate the answering of parliamentary questions during the recess. This is probably more important now, given that we have moved to a budgetary cycle in line with the European semester when the budget is announced in October. Members and political parties try to prepare for the budget and usually need the summer months, particularly August and early September, to do so, but during these months they cannot receive answers from the Government. Will the Government give effect during its lifetime to this commitment to answer parliamentary questions?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	We have had that discussion during the years and I assume the Deputy is referring to written replies. Replies are given practically until the end of July. If the House is not sitting, Ministers cannot be present. In fairness to the public service which goes to extraordinary lengths on occasion, it is effectively reduced in number for the month of August. Written replies are provided up to the end of July and from September. We will look at the issue. In respect of the property tax, the legislation provides for an increase or a reduction of 15%. This measure has to be in place. Whether it requires regulations to be introduced by the Minister is something on which he will comment, but that is the intent of the law and what it means. It might not be as easy for people to fulfil all of the promises they made when the issue comes before them. The issue of direct recapitalisation has been driven by Ireland and the €60 billion left is specifically due to Ireland's commitment to it. It is welcome that agreement was reached in the past two days on another aspect of the issue. Obviously, it means that countries such as Ireland which wish to make a claim for direct recapitalisation can do so at the end of November. Clearly, it has been an intention of Ireland to keep this issue very much in focus for the past couple of years and I am glad that agreement was reached in Brussels in the past two days. I want the banking inquiry to happen quickly. The matter that has been a cause of some controversy in the Seanad will be dealt with very shortly.

I will advise the Deputy on whether it requires regulations or legislation.

However, it contains a commitment regarding State board appointments and other appointments made by Ministers whereby all such appointees would appear before various Oireachtas committees to be scrutinised.That was a key area to be addressed in the democratic revolution that was promised by this Government. It has not happened in my area - health - or broadly across all areas of the Government and State. Does that commitment still exist? Does it require legislation or changes in Standing Orders? What is the reason for the delay? Is it just that the political will has evaporated into the ether?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	I am very glad Deputy Kelleher continues to read the programme for Government. That is good. I know he has it with him in his car. I hope he does not read it when he is stopped at the traffic lights but only reads it in his spare time. The requirement is for the chairpersons of bodies to appear before the committees. If any chairperson of an important body has not appeared before a committee, we should look into that. The commitment still stands and, to my knowledge, a number of the chairpersons have appeared before committees to discuss their experience, their expertise and what they bring to the different bodies to which they have been appointed.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	228	I welcome the opportunity to raise this important matter in the House today and thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting it for debate. The issues raised in the HIQA report on University Hospital Limerick confirm the unacceptable overcrowding at the emergency department there. While it has been an issue for many years, overcrowding has escalated since the turn of the year. It is not acceptable that patients are left on trolleys for extended periods. It is not acceptable that vulnerable, sick and often elderly patients are crammed into a confined space and put at risk of cross infection with little or no privacy or dignity. It is not acceptable that doctors, nurses and other staff be asked to work in this type of environment. The report is welcome and must be acted on. The HIQA report can and must be the catalyst for change within the Limerick hospital group. All short, medium and long-term options must be explored including the provision of additional bed capacity at the site at Dooradoyle, Limerick, bringing forward the opening of the new, state-of-the-art emergency department at Limerick by cutting red tape from 2016-17, improved use of the three model-2 hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's, and exploring the option of incorporating a model-3 hospital within the UL hospital group. Public confidence in our health service is essential. It is critical that the issues raised by HIQA are acted on strategically. The report strengthens the hand of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to seek additional funding and resources. I ask that a case be made to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to seeking the required funding to enable the Minister for Health to bring about the changes which are required so that we in the mid-west region can have a functioning health service of which we can all be proud.

It is not fit for purpose and is unacceptable for patients and the staff who do such fantastic work in the hospital. The report discussed fast-tracking the new accident and emergency service at University Hospital Limerick. The new building is complete with the exception of the internal fit-out for the accident and emergency unit. I have seen the building myself. My understanding is that the fit-out will not commence until November and has currently gone out to tender. Why is there a six-month delay? Why was the contract for the fit-out not in place to commence when the building was ready, which is now? What can be done to fast-track this? We need to have the new accident and emergency facility open as a matter of urgency for the people of Limerick and the wider region. A possible interim measure would be to open the acute and medical assessment unit located above the current accident and emergency department on a 24-hour basis. When triage takes place, medical issues could be directed to the acute medical services overhead while trauma cases could be directed to the ground floor and the existing accident and emergency unit. What we need now is action. Can we bring forward the completion date for the fit-out of the accident and emergency unit at University Hospital Limerick? What has caused the six-month delay?
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	I welcome the presence of the Minister for Health to take the matter. I thank him for being here. It is obvious that all five Members who are raising the matter have the same goal, which is to make the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Limerick a pleasant place for patients. We want to get rid of the overcrowding which has reduced privacy and bring dignity back to patients again. That is extremely important. I welcome the HIQA report, which is timely. We all knew about it anyway, but it is time for us to work together to get a solution which takes us over the next two years. Colleagues have spoken about fast-tracking the emergency department at Limerick and I certainly agree that it is an option we should consider. We should be looking at further options to reduce the crowds coming into the accident and emergency unit in Limerick. It is quite obvious that the hospital is over capacity. We know there is a problem at University Hospital Limerick and that there is a problem trying to fill doctor positions. There is a real problem for staff who work in atrocious conditions. Morale is very low in the hospital. This is about good management of the system and trying to make good what is in place. There must be a re-examination of the whole system to see if the HSE got it wrong in relation to reconfiguration. These are all issues we must examine. A meeting will take place at the hospital next Monday morning for the Oireachtas Members from the region. I welcome the opportunity to be at the meeting to raise my concerns about reconfiguration. I am also anxious to hear today what the Minister has to say on the current situation. That is important. It is also important that we all work together to ensure that the conditions patients are experiencing in the accident and emergency unit are alleviated. It is totally unacceptable. We are all here with the single goal of making the accident and emergency unit a better place.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	I do not envy the the Minister his position. He inherited a health system which was largely dysfunctional. I do not envy any of his colleagues their jobs, all of which are about doing more with less.This is not about the Minister and his position or his colleagues and their positions; rather it is about my constituents. The Minister should put himself in their shoes. The 2009 HIQA report indicated to them that the current configuration was inadequate and unsafe. A plethora of medical experts told them that the answer was to move emergency services to Limerick Regional Hospital, as it was then called. It now has the more grandiose title of University Hospital Limerick. Five years later, my constituents are effectively told by HIQA, the body that told them the then configuration was unsafe, that the emergency unit to which they entrust their lives and those of their elderly parents and children is not fit for purpose. We are no longer being told that the problem with the health service lies with a lack of funding but with management. We are now being told it needs more money. There is dysfunction at the heart of the service, for which the Department and the Cabinet, which acts collectively, must take responsibility. The problem must be fixed. I will read from the press release issued by HIQA. It states: "The absence of a statutory governance framework is hindering the development of strong governance and patient safety functions". That has nothing to do with the availability of money; rather, it is a failure of this House and the Government to put such a statutory governance framework in place. The report states: "Moreover, 22% of patients requiring emergency hip fracture surgery had their surgery cancelled due to a theatre list overrun", despite the studies conducted in Limerick showing that theatre were underused and mismanaged. It also states: "The single most significant risk observed by the Authority in ULH during the course of this review was the persistent overcrowding in the Emergency Department (ED)".

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	This is important because it indicates a failure of the Government to take responsibility for dealing with the overcrowding. The report states:The single most significant risk observed by the Authority in ULH during the course of this review was the persistent overcrowding in the Emergency Department (ED). The overcrowding impacted negatively on patients (adults and children) and on staff. It impeded access to patients for care and observation, reduced privacy and dignity, increased the risk of transmission of infection and prevented adequate cleaning of the department.I want to know what the Minister will do about it on behalf of the Government.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	234	I agree with my colleagues in much of what has been said. This was an announced visit by HIQA and one must ask what it would have discovered if it had been unannounced. There should be follow-up unannounced visits. I have said before that I am very concerned about two groups, namely, the patients using the regional hospital in Dooradoyle and the staff working there, whose morale is on the floor. It is not helping that we are moving around the deckchairs in respect of how the Limerick Regional Hospital Group is being managed. This adds to the uncertainty. A person said to me at the weekend that the only people who found the report shocking were those who had not been in the accident and emergency unit in Limerick for a long time. It is suffering the consequences of a flawed and failed reconfiguration programme that saw services in Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's hospitals being moved to an already crowded University Hospital Limerick, with no facilities being made available by the previous Administration. We are now living with the consequences and must fix the problem. We must fix it for our constituents who deserve better. Unfortunately, I have had cause to spend more than my fair share of time in the accident and emergency unit in University Hospital Limerick. It is not acceptable that in 2014 we must wait for a HIQA report for something to be done. The new building is under construction. I refer to the comments of Deputy Joe Carey on capacity across the mid-western, western and southern regions as an interim measure to divert patients away from the area in their own interests. This has continued for too long. With his colleague, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health has invested substantially in the hospital and its physical infrastructure. We now have a statutory agency, the one that stated services in Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's hospitals were unsafe, stating the hospital that was supposed to be the relief valve for these hospitals is unsafe. The people of the mid-western region deserve better.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	235	I regret that I only have four minutes in which to reply because many good points have been made and I need to inform the Deputies of several points. I thank them for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to welcome publication of the HIQA report on the review of governance in the University of Limerick Hospitals Group. It is the first hospital group to be assessed against the national standards for safer and better health care which I approved in accordance with the Health Act 2007. The review is an independent assessment of services against explicit standards and it is important that the findings, good and bad, be made clear. This will help to drive improvements in the quality and safety of health services. I want to move away from reports being used to undermine and close services and use them to address the issues raised within them and fix them. The report makes it clear that significant challenges remain, as outlined by the Deputies, particularly in emergency services. It also identifies the significant progress made in corporate and clinical governance and on the reorganisation of services within the group. Among the many positive developments are the establishment of a new management structure, including the board of management, the CEO and management team and the clinical directorate; the reconfiguration of surgical, critical care and paediatric services; and the establishment of an infection prevention and control team. With regard to risks, the HSE has identified actions that have and will be taken to address the concerns raised and provide an improved and safer service for patients. The key risk area identified is unscheduled care. I fully acknowledge that there are ongoing pressures on the accident and emergency unit, which is why an extensive capital project is under way to build a new state-of-the-art unit. It will be difficult to cover the issues raised in the short time I have available. I want to respond to Deputy Kieran O'Donnell by saying there has not been a delay. The tendering has been undertaken in parallel. When he meets Ms Ann Doherty, he will be told very clearly that there is no second fix. A huge amount of work remains to be done before the fit-out is undertaken. The tender will be complete and there should be a seamless progression towards the fit-out. There should not be a delay. Since the report was published, a separate paediatric emergency area has been fully opened. It provides a separate, family-friendly area for children who require an emergency response. It clearly reduces overcrowding to some extent.  A 17 bed short stay unit opened on 25 April and is being managed by the acute medicine physicians. The unit admits short stay patients who can be discharged within 48 hours of admission.  A new €35 million critical care unit opened recently. This is a major step forward in the development of acute hospital services across the region.  The acute medical and surgical assessment units are open and accept direct referrals from GPs and the emergency unit. GPs can bypass the emergency unit. Further information campaigns will be undertaken locally to advise GPs and the public of the availability of three local injury units and medical assessment units in the region - in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals. These are very good model 2 hospitals with a critical role in supporting people in the area. In parallel with these measures, the special delivery unit will support the hospital and provide the expertise required to provide both interim and long-term sustainable solutions to deal with the issues of bed capacity, excessive trolley waits and overcrowding in the emergency unit. The establishment of the hospital groups has the potential to bring about significant improvements in the way we organise acute hospitals. In that regard, I am satisfied that group boards are capable of exercising authority assertively and constructively. Deputy Michael McNamara did not read further from the report which states: "Notwithstanding, the Authority welcomed the fact that the reporting relationship between the HSE’s National Director for Acute Hospitals and ULH was described as being both supportive and enabling, thereby allowing the Board of Directors, CEO and Executive Management Team flexibility in reorganising and restructuring their services as appropriate". The issue cannot be addressed until the legislation is enacted to create trusts. We made it clear that we would have a trial period for hospital groups to see how they worked and where there were deficits. Deputies referred to the absence of a model 3 hospital in the group.I believe this is something we need to examine closely. I want to assure people that we will continue to work to make this hospital as safe as possible. Other issues in the report that have not been raised by the Deputies here are of equal concern to me and must be addressed - in particular, the length of time people with a broken hip must wait on trolleys. This is a critical issue and I have asked for information on this to be sent to me. Four hours is the gold standard, but I want to know how many people wait longer than six hours. Surgery for a fractured hip should never be cancelled because of theatre lists. I understand from speaking to management that they have issues around the figure in regard to this. Sometimes the cancellations have not been due to lack of theatre time but for medical reasons, where the patient is not fit for surgery or has developed complications that must be sorted out.  This is not to ignore what HIQA is doing here. It provides a great service and I welcome the fact that it is there. I wish the CEO of HIQA, the chairman and all its staff the best. HIQA exists to help us see where there are problems so we can fix them. That is what we intend to do.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I welcome the Minister's comments, particularly his commitment to a special delivery unit that will liaise with the Limerick hospital groups to come up with both short-term and interim solutions to the bed capacity issue. I welcome his comments regarding the exploration of the establishment of a model 3 hospital within the hospital group also. I believe this report will help drive improvements at University Hospital Limerick, and I look forward to working closely with the Minister and the CEO of the hospital group to bring that about so that we will have a health service of which we can all be proud.

On the issue of the build, we need to know whether the accident and emergency unit will be completed by 2016. We represent the patients and constituents in Limerick and we know that the issue of overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick is not going to disappear unless the accident and emergency build and fit-out is fast-tracked. The shell of the building is complete and the main contractors are due to come off-site shortly. However, it seems the fit-out will not start until November. Why is it not happening sooner? We need this accident and emergency unit to open. The HSE is coming before the Committee of Public Accounts tomorrow and I have alerted it that I intend to raise this issue there. I represent the people of Limerick city and this issue is of huge significance for them. I will also raise the issue with those in the management of University Hospital Limerick when I meet them next Monday. We are all on the same page on this. It is about patient safety and looking after hospital staff. The biggest issue raised in the report was overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit. Therefore, we need to bring forward the new purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility as soon as possible. These are legitimate questions that I have been asked to ask on behalf of the people of Limerick and people who use the accident and emergency unit. Many of these people are elderly patients and they have been in touch with us regularly on the issue of overcrowding. Now is the time to act. We have the opportunity, so we should fast-track this project and work together.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	I want to focus on the issue of the absence of a model 3 hospital in the mid-western hospital group, which is a contributory factor in the overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick. I was delighted to hear the Minister's comments in regard to exploring the idea of a possible model 3 hospital in the region. Ennis is well placed to become a model 3 hospital and such a hospital would help resolve the issues around overcrowding. If we look at the size of County Clare and the distances people have to travel from Blackhead or Loop Head to University Hospital Limerick, we see good reason to place a model 3 hospital there. This could be done relatively cheaply. Doctors could be on a rotating roster between both hospitals and the infrastructure is already in place. All that is necessary is the will on the part of the HSE to put a model 3 hospital in place, similar to the models in place at Galway University Hospital and Cork University Hospital. I am glad to hear the Minister is exploring all options in this area and I thank him for his response. I hope we can work together on this to ensure we get the greatest benefits for the people of the mid-western region in the area of health services.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	The Minister spoke about patients with hip fractures waiting more than four hours. I could point the Minister to a patient in my constituency who waited four days. Each day she waited, this patient knew that her chance of a successful operation was diminishing, yet she waited day after day. Talk of a model 3 hospital is all well and good, but let us be realistic. Live horse, get grass. We cannot even open an emergency unit, much less a new level 3 hospital. The plan is for a level 3 hospital for 2020. That is great, but what about now? I join Deputy O'Donnell in asking when will the new emergency department be open and taking patients. This is not an unreasonable question. If, as the Minister pointed out, the problem is legislation, when will we have that legislation? If we can sit overnight to liquidate a bank, and if we can sit in July for emergency legislation, we can sit this coming July to deal with legislation, provided the problem is legislation and that this is not just an excuse the Minister can hide behind. A lot of politics is being played in this House and a lot of politics was played in advance of the last election in regard to health. It is interesting to hear that the lack of further expenditure on health is laid at the door of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by one Deputy and that the thanks for the expenditure there has been is laid at the door of the Minister for Finance by another. We are in Government and must front up and take responsibility. I would like the Minister here to take responsibility and tell me when the emergency department will open and when we will have legislation, if that is the problem.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	240	I will not take lectures from anybody. The question I asked related to the capacity that exists in the western region, the south east and the south, in places like Tralee, Mallow, Cork and Galway, particularly in regard to ambulance services. If these services come from peripheral areas, such as north Clare or west Limerick, could they use capacity in other areas? In other words, rather than sending an ambulance into Dooradoyle where the accident and emergency unit is already full, could capacity in Tralee, Mallow, Cork or Galway be used? The south east of Limerick, for example, is within striking distance of Clonmel. We have an immediate problem, but rather than looking at fixed geographical boundaries, we should consider looking at measures outside those boundaries. I welcome the commitment in regard to a model 3 hospital. The visit referred to in the report was an announced visit, but it needs to be followed up by a similar unannounced visit. We must ensure two things. We must ensure patients are safe, which is HIQA's remit, but we must also look after the staff who are looking after the patients in these hospitals. Their morale is on the floor.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. Deputy Carey mentioned the risk of cross-infection. I am happy to report that we have the lowest incidence of MRSA in our hospitals now since records began. I want to mention the model 2 hospitals. We need better use of these hospitals. This does not just mean using the beds in these hospitals, but that the staff working in these hospitals must co-operate and be part of the larger group and be prepared to work on different sites. We must not have a situation in which staff refuse to move from their own model 2 hospital. This is not acceptable.  I agree 100% with Deputy O'Donnell that we need to expedite the new accident and emergency unit and ensure it is opened as soon as possible. That is our goal.My understanding, having spoken to the manager, is that there is no delay. There will be a seamless passage through. That said, the Deputy will receive a more comprehensive answer from the HSE tomorrow and I utterly respect his right to seek such on behalf of the people of Limerick. If there is anything else we can do to accelerate this, we will do it.  Deputy Breen made reference to "all five of us" but I would say "all six of us". We are all here to improve the situation. There are issues around how things are managed but I wish to put it on the record of the House that we have a very good manager in Limerick University Hospital group and we will be sorry to see her go. Her departure will be Cork's gain, or more specifically, Cork City Council.  Deputy McNamara said earlier that in the past it was all about money and now it is all about management. It is not all about any one thing but about everything. Regarding the case he mentioned, can I presume the woman was not waiting on a trolley for four days with a fractured hip?

I am committing to exploring the lack of a model three hospital in the group.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	Sorry, but seeing as the Deputy has raised his voice in this debate, let us be clear about this. It was Deputy Kelleher's Government that reconfigured those hospitals and put the horse behind the cart instead of the other way around by closing facilities before new facilities were built. It left it to the next Government to clean up the mess. Deputy O'Donovan made reference to unannounced visits which is something that HIQA does already and will continue to do. It has done it with other hospitals and the Deputies will see the results of that in reports published today on other hospitals.  Change is always challenging and difficult and people feel threatened by it occasionally but I believe the changes we are introducing vis-à-vis the hospital group will devolve more authority and autonomy locally, giving local people a much greater say in how their service is configured and delivered. I believe that is important. I will finish by assuring Deputies that we will expedite all of those issues that can be expedited, some of which were not raised today but are contained in this report - particularly the issue of the use of the model 2 hospitals and their staff. The aim is to ensure that we have a safe service. In that context, the report does not say that this is unsafe service but rather that there are risks that must be addressed. We will do everything we can to address those risks as quickly as possible. I, as a doctor and Minister for Health, do not want to see patients suffering.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I came in here with the hope of learning something about the actions the Minister proposes to take to address some of the concerns highlighted in the HIQA report on the University Hospital in Limerick. The HIQA report, whether the Minister likes it or not, is damning, with its references to "persistent overcrowding" and its use of terms like "unacceptable" and "not fit for purpose". Page 74 of the report lists 11 risk issues requiring action, nine of which are deemed to be high risk. There are risks to patients and that has to be accepted. There is no point in pretending that this report is doing anything other than highlighting the deficiencies and inadequacies in the emergency department in Limerick. It is also highlighting deficiencies within the overall health system. The report makes reference to the absence of clear interim advice and direction from the Department of Health and the HSE with regard to integrated governance arrangements between voluntary and public services in the context of emerging hospital groups and single boards. That is a criticism of the Department and of the Minister. It is an observation that there is an absence of clear interim advice which is code for saying the Department and the Minister are not quite sure what they are doing. That is what this particular report states. The Minister has come in here and promised to look at model 3 hospitals in order to address some of the concerns in the midlands but I do not believe that will happen. The reason for my disbelief is clear to see. One only has to look to Roscommon or the north east and the promises that were made on a new hospital instead of the ones at Navan and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda. These commitments were made and they are far from being carried through. In fact, the reverse has been the case in Roscommon and in the north east. The bottom line is that there is a massive difficulty in emergency departments throughout the country. As recently as this morning Dr. Chris Luke, in an article in The Daily Mail, said that in the last week he has seen just one or two non-consultant hospital doctors trying to run the emergency department. He described this as stressful, not to mention difficult and dangerous. We have a deficiency of staff in our emergency departments and we are facing a turnover of non-consultant hospital doctors very soon. That will happen in July and I can guarantee it will create huge difficulties in our emergency departments this year. The lack of consultants will be compounded by the non-consultant hospital doctor changeover and the difficulties in recruiting doctors for the areas in which they are needed most. The Minister and I both know that this will happen. It is an ongoing problem.  The Minister has suggested that there are some issues in this report that we can address and that dealing with delays in emergency departments will address all of the concerns raised but that is not the case. There are many inherent problems in our emergency departments throughout the country. The trick has been to use the trolley count as a measure of success versus failure, with the Minister saying that there were 550 people on trolleys in 2011 but now the figure is 300, which indicates success and that we are going in the right direction. The problem is that we are not going in the right direction. We still have inherent problems in our emergency departments throughout the country. Deputy McNamara just raised the case of a woman with a broken hip waiting for treatment for four days. The Minister is right in saying that there may have been clinical reasons for the wait but I can give the Minister countless examples of people who have been waiting in emergency departments for hours on end. I will give the Minister a concrete example of some of the difficulties faced by people in our emergency departments when I respond to his reply.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	The way the Deputy spoke about it implied that she was. The Deputy chose to focus on my commitment to explore the lack of a model three hospital in this hospital group and ignored all of the other things that were said with regard to the opening of a paediatric area and an extra 17 beds, as well as our commitment to get the issues around the model 2 hospitals sorted to ensure that the beds, the urgent care centres and the services of the staff in those hospitals are used in an appropriate way. The House is very aware that I regard trolley waits and other delays in the treatment of patients in emergency departments to be unacceptable. However, it should be noted that Deputy Kelleher has just stood up in this Chamber and said that a reduction from 569 people on trolleys on a given day in January 2011, when his party was last in government, to under 300 people on all days since May is the wrong direction of travel. Is the Deputy suggesting that we should be travelling towards 600 or 700 patients on trolleys? We all know that there are lots of problems in our emergency departments but responsibility for delays does not solely rest with those departments. As John Donne wrote, "No man is an island, entire of itself" and so it is with the health service. We cannot fix the emergency departments unless we fix hospital wards and we cannot sort the wards out unless we have access to long-stay beds in the community, home help and home care packages. We also need a properly functioning primary care system that catches illnesses early and treats patients before they require hospital treatment, particularly those with chronic illnesses. All of the things to which I refer take time to achieve. We would love if they could be achieved more quickly but we are faced with the reality that the health service evolved chaotically over many decades. We are trying to bring order to the service for the benefit of patients. The special delivery unit, SDU, has had a great impact in supporting those on the front line by means of the establishment of clinical programmes. Provisional patient experience times for May 2014 show that 68% of patients attending emergency departments were discharged home or admitted within six hours and that 82% where discharged home or admitted within nine hours. I accept that this means that 18% were neither discharged home nor admitted. However, when Fianna Fáil was in government it was common for people to be obliged to lie on trolleys for three or four days. A number of my patients have had experience of this, but it no longer happens. I have emphasised that rather than considering just the number of people who are on trolleys each morning, we must take account of patient experience times. I am aware that there are some people who are still obliged to lie on trolleys for more than 24 hours, which is unacceptable. The 30-day moving average trolley count by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, remains below 300 patients per day. The figure as of 6 June last was just 227 patients, or more than 8% fewer than at the same point last year. To date this year, the system has reported 8.4% fewer patients on trolleys compared to the same period in 2013, which represents a reduction of 2,578 patients. Relative to the baseline year of 2011, the percentage reduction in the number of patients on trolleys is 31.9%. This is equivalent to a reduction of 13,224 patients. However, the task of further improvement continues. From the outset the aim has always been to provide the right care at the right time in the right place. One of the most essential actions to assist with this task is for patients to make use of the non-emergency facilities, such as urgent care and medical assessment units, in many of our smaller hospitals, which can cater for the majority of their injuries and episodes of acute illness. I urge people to make use of these facilities. I do not want my comments to be immediately interpreted as my saying that it is the people's fault. That is not the case. We must make people aware of the value of medical assessment units in particular. As we have seen, there is potential for delays in the transfer of patients from ambulances to emergency departments. In order to address this issue the national ambulance service has developed a hospital turnaround framework, which clarifies the process of clinical handover, establishing clear lines of responsibility and the standards expected. I could continue, but I will conclude by assuring the House that hospitals are working with the SDU to put in place all possible additional measures in order to support a safe and high-quality patient care service. I am a member of a Government that is committed to everything to which I refer. I do not set myself aside from the Government; I am an integral part of it. We are all striving to fix this problem.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	My difficulty is that those opposite have been in government for more than three years. Some of the promises they made prior to the most recent general election were quite outlandish. The Minister highlighted the provision of health care, which is essential for emergency departments to work, and he also referred to the home help service. In the context of the latter, the number of home help hours has been slashed by 1 million. Some of what he says just does not match up to reality. For example, he has prioritised the notion of people being cared for outside acute hospital settings and in primary care settings or at home, but this is simply not happening as a result of the fact that the requisite resources are not being provided. The National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, advocacy and patient groups and Deputies on all sides have all highlighted the fact that general practice is facing a crisis. However, the Minister is talking about having those with chronic illnesses cared for in general practices throughout the country. As he and I both know, that is not happening because those in general practice have not been given the resources necessary to keep people with chronic illnesses out of our acute hospitals. We were obliged to almost force the Government to fund home care packages. Such packages constitute a very proactive mechanism to ensure people can move, on a step-down basis, from acute hospital settings to their own homes, where they can then receive treatment and care. These packages are an integral part of the solution to the problem of taking people out of emergency departments and hospitals in general. The report in respect of University Hospital Limerick highlights the fact that there are huge deficiencies in the area of safety alone. What I find most amazing is that on the many occasions when Deputies on this side of the House and front-line medical professionals at the hospital have highlighted the fact that there is overcrowding at the emergency department in Limerick, that patients' safety is being put at risk and that the staff there are operating under huge pressure, the Minister has continually denied that this is the case. The HIQA report confirms everything that has been said, including by those on the front line, in respect of this matter. That report must be acted upon immediately. The difficulty is that I do not believe the Minister is capable of acting upon it.

I have not denied that there is overcrowding in our emergency departments and neither have I denied that a problem exists. I have set out to address that problem. The budget relating to home help hours was restored in 2013. In this year's budget, we have taken additional money out of the long-term care nursing home support scheme in order that we might provide more innovative ways to allow people to stay at home rather than going into long-term care before they need to do so. People do not want to enter such care any sooner than is necessary. Regardless of how nice nursing homes may be, I know of no one who wants to be in one unless it is really necessary. We do not often - the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government certainly never did - provide a range of alternatives in that regard. There is a need for a more tiered approach and we must explore the position which obtains at facilities such as the excellent one in Waterford operated by the Holy Ghost Fathers, which I visited. People use the latter as their home but they are not in a nursing home per se. At another facility in Carlow, people go out during the day before returning to stay at night while others stay during the day and go home at night. These individuals need a range of services which will help them maintain their independence and address the issues which arise for them as they get older. My commitment to addressing the health services issues in question remains unstinting. I am utterly determined that we will fix this problem. However, we have always stated that the introduction of universal health insurance would take two terms of Government.

All the actions we have taken to date are leading us along the path to that goal. As a doctor, I accept that we must care for those who are acutely ill today. It must not be a case of "Live horse, eat grass" and people being obliged to wait for treatment. Last year, for the first time, we counted the number of people on the outpatient waiting list, which was something Fianna Fáil refused to do for the 14 years it was in government.

When Fianna Fáil was in power, it had neither targets nor figures. It threw billions at the problem and quadrupled the health spend over a 12-year period. However, we still ended up with a dreadful crisis in the health service. In that context and as the Deputy alluded to, on a single day in January 2011 there were 569 people on trolleys in our hospitals.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	At present, there is a proposal to take vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, training places from Tallaght and give them to Balbriggan. As the Minister of State is aware, Tallaght has one of the highest rates of unemployment among those between the ages of 18 and 24 in the country. I am requesting that the decision to transfer the training places to which I refer to Balbriggan be put on hold. There is no logic to what is being done. The decision does not make sense, particularly from a financial point of view. Tallaght was more affected than any other area by the collapse in the building trade. The latter provided employment for many young people in Tallaght and these individuals require help in order that they might retrain and upskill.These vocational training opportunities scheme places are very important and are part of this upskilling and employment-finding process. Under these changes Balbriggan will now have two VTOS places for every 1,000 residents while Tallaght and Walkinstown will have less than one for every 1,000 residents. Where is the logic or fairness in that? Why does Balbriggan deserve more than Tallaght and Walkinstown? It is not a case of being against resources going to Balbriggan, but where is the logic in this process? Who has made this decision? It is an ill-thought-out decision and will have a very negative effect on Tallaght and Clondalkin. I hope the Minister of State will reconsider the decision, intervene personally and do the right thing. Why close the operation in St. Dominic's national school where, I understand, the rent is €11,000 per year and is negotiable with the school principal? Why send 20 VTOS places to Balbriggan with the added cost of premises, resources and teaching hours? It has been suggested to me by staff that those 20 VTOS places are equivalent to two classes at 15 teaching hours per week. If we multiply that by a 32 weeks, that is, the school year, and an average gross pay of €50 per hour it amounts to €48,500 to be paid to teachers. These are all extra costs for the education and training board because we already have teachers in the Tallaght setting. There does not appear to me to be any saving in Tallaght apart from the €11,000 in rent. In early March this year a third computer room was set up in St. Dominic's for VTOS along with electrical and data points. There will now be an extra cost for the computers, fitting out the rooms and the move to the enterprise centre in Cookstown along with data protection and so on. I have been informed by the Department how much all of this will cost but I have been quoted a figure of €10,000. Furthermore, the lease on the enterprise centre is up in two years. Again, everything will probably have to be moved. How much will that cost? What is the point in moving from St. Dominic's? The decision to close St. Dominic's and move the extra 20 Tallaght VTOS places elsewhere seems to have been made recently. Reference was made to putting in the electrical points in during March. Otherwise, why fund a third computer room in March this year? I understand from the Department that the decision has been made purely for financial reasons. However, what I have outlined to the Minister of State today is that this does not add up. Why are we doing this? I look forward to the reply from the Minister of State and I hope he has looked into the situation. I hope he has seen the common sense of my remarks on the matter. Tallaght cannot afford to lose any resources. It is not a case of taking them away from Balbriggan. The resources are based in the area at the moment and we cannot afford to lose them. Will the Minister of State reconsider this foolish decision?
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position in respect of the VTOS programme in St. Dominic's national school, Tallaght. The vocational training opportunities scheme is a second-chance education and training programme for unemployed adults in receipt of certain Department of Social Protection payments. The courses are full-time and can last up to two years. VTOS students can pursue subjects in the junior and leaving certificate examinations or modules certified by Quality and Qualifications Ireland at levels 3 to 6 under the national framework of qualifications. Learners participating on VTOS courses receive a training allowance along with meal and travel allowances and they may be entitled to child care support. Currently almost 6,000 people are availing of second-chance education under VTOS throughout the country and VTOS places are operated by the education and training boards from funding provided by SOLAS, the new further education and training authority. The main objective of SOLAS is to develop, fund and oversee an integrated further education and training sector. The former FÁS training centres and the 800 associated staff will transfer on a gradual basis to the recently formed education and training boards. These bodies will be responsible for the delivery of an integrated further education and training system. That transfer process commenced on 1 January this year and will be completed by the end of this year. One of the first major tasks carried out by SOLAS was the development of Ireland's first ever five-year strategy for further education and training, launched on 12 May. This has been developed following consultation with the key stakeholders and has set out a proposed roadmap for the further education and training sector in response to the needs and opportunities for the short, medium and longer term. It will seek to ensure the provision of high-quality further education and training programmes which are responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changed and changing economy. The Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board is a statutory body with significant autonomy with responsibility for education and training provision in the region. The ETB has 510 approved VTOS places and the allocation of these places to centres under its remit is a matter for the board. Following the amalgamation of the former Dublin and Dún Laoghaire vocational education committees, the establishment of the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board and the merger of the former FÁS services, the board carried out a review, as required, of the provision of all adult education services. In considering VTOS places the board concluded that some 80 places were available in Tallaght at adult education services and a further 40 places were available nearby in Greenhills College. By comparison, Balbriggan, one of the fastest-growing areas in western Europe, only had 20 places. The board then made the decision to increase the available places in Balbriggan by 20, up to 40 leaving 100 places available in the general Tallaght area. Education and training boards are expected to manage their resources to provide the best service for all areas under their remit and that ultimately will lead to changes in provision in particular areas from time to time.

The Minister of State said the ETB is an independent board and manages its own resources to provide the best service and so on. The Minister of State outlined that Tallaght and Walkinstown have certain positions. He also said that Balbriggan is a growing area and so on. I put it to the Minister of State that what the board is proposing, with the compliance of the Minister of State, allows for one place per 1,000 residents while Balbriggan gets double the amount that Tallaght gets. Does that make any sense? Reference was made to saving money. Where are the savings? Will the Minister of State let me know where the savings will come from? All the Minister of State is throwing at me is that there is an independent board which has made a decision. I want to know why the board has made the decision. There is no logic to what the Minister of State has said today. I cannot go back to the people of Tallaght and state that the ETB is an independent board and has made its decision. On what grounds did the board make the decision? I do not know because the Minister of State has not told me and I am unsure whether the Minister of State knows himself.

Young people who have no hope at the moment are living in the Tallaght and Walkinstown areas and this is one of the only chances they have for retraining and reskilling. I have put that to the Minister of State. Many of them come from the construction industry. The Minister of State must take on board some of these ideas. It is simply not good enough. Will the Minister of State listen, please? Will he please look at this again? There is no logic to what the board is doing. I accept that the board is independent and so on but the Minister of State has a role. The Minister of State should be championing these areas. If it is a case of a shortage of resources in Balbriggan then the Minister of State should pull them from some other area. He should not pull them out of this area. It is unfair on the people in that area.

I told Deputy Crowe that the reason was that the board is responsible for the allocation of resources within its region. That power has been conferred upon the board by legislation passed in this House. The board also has significant representation. Local authority representatives across the region have a serious role to play in determining the policy within the board in conjunction with the management of that board.

Removing 20 of 120 places and allocating them to an area with population that, in the ETB's opinion, is rapidly increasing is a reasonable decision. I stand over it on the basis of the expertise and wisdom to be found in the ETB which render it well able to make such decisions.

Many believe a ten day period is too short. In amendment No. 8 Deputy Dessie Ellis proposes a period of one month. My amendment aims to offer tenants, particularly those at risk of losing their homes under the section 2 process, more time to manage the issue. Most Deputies who have reflected on the Bill believe ten working days is too short. In terms of social protection, for example, we are used to a 21 day period for appeals. Section 12 relates to proceedings initiated by the housing authority to recover possession in circumstances where a household has breached a tenancy agreement. A tenant and family losing a home is a matter of such grave importance that an appropriate amount of time must be afforded to allow people to prepare for proceedings in the District Court. As the Minister of State knows, it is critical that fair procedures be guaranteed under all legislation. The principle of equality of arms in legal proceedings must also be respected in order that tenants have adequate opportunities to obtain legal advice and have representation. In Focus Ireland's submission on the general scheme of the Bill it highlighted the short timeframe of ten working days. That timeframe has not been changed. I understand Focus Ireland has called for at least 30 working days, which is longer than one month. I propose 21 working days which is in line with Deputy Dessie Ellis's proposal and would afford a person subject to proceedings under section 12, 13 or 17 approximately one month in which to prepare for them. Section 13 relates to the recovery of possession of dwellings that are unlawfully occupied. The minimum notice period to be afforded by the housing authority to the person or persons occupying the dwelling is ten working days. Section 17 relates to the recovery of possession of local authority dwellings in circumstances where the tenants have died and the properties are occupied by persons not entitled under the Bill to become tenants. The minimum notice period in this regard is also ten working days. This tiny period is particularly unfair, as the substantive provisions of section 17 could directly affect family members who have suffered a bereavement, a difficult time in their lives. The Northside Community Law Centre which provided me with a briefing on the Bill and its submission on the general scheme has rightly pointed out that there is a gap in the law, in that section 17 is silent on what should happen in circumstances where a person's application to succeed in a tenancy is, on the one hand, refused and, on the other, the District Court judge handling proceedings taken under section 17 refuses to grant an application by a housing authority to recover possession of the dwelling. There appears to be a lacuna in the law in circumstances where the local authority does not succeed in the District Court. The law centre has asked what are the obligations of the local authority in such cases. Perhaps the Minister of State might accept my amendment or introduce another to close this apparent gap. There is a strong feeling the ten day periods outlined in these sections are too short for justice to be done and proper preparations to be made for court cases. The Minister of State should reconsider them.

Tenants face all sorts of issues, for example, difficulties with language, literacy or addiction. Some will face the threat of eviction and homelessness. Given everything that this entails, I would opt for a period of 15 days.

I will be advising housing authorities that, generally speaking, they should give longer notice than the minimum period but occasionally there will be cases where the minimum notice only can be given because of the necessity for the housing authority to move quickly to repossess the dwelling. Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966, which is being replaced by sections 12, 13 and 17, does not specify any minimum notice period for the housing authority's warrant application. It is worth noting also that each of the possession proceedings covered by the amendment includes provision for the court to adjourn the proceedings as it thinks fit. The court can adjourn the proceedings if it believes more times is needed, with or without conditions, and it could use this power where a tenant claims that he or she was not given sufficient time to prepare for the hearing of the possession application. I refer to a Supreme Court case, Dublin City Council v. Fennell in 2005, in which there was an observation in the court that section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 had survived constitutional and judicial scrutiny up to that point not least because of the obvious needs of a housing authority to be able to manage effectively and control its housing stock without being unduly restricted or fettered while so doing. The same considerations apply to the possession proceeding now proposed, and that is why, in the case of a breach of a tenancy agreement such as anti-social behaviour that has serious detrimental effects on the quality of life of other people in the locality, section 12(3)(b) provides that a housing authority is required to give notice of a possession order application to the tenant concerned not later than the time it makes the application. I stress that this is a minimum, not a maximum, period and that there are some cases where the local authority needs to move quickly and that the court can, if it deems it appropriate, provide for more time for the tenant.

All of us would have concerns about this issue. One cannot represent people in respect of housing matters without quickly coming across the scourge of anti-social behaviour. The Minister mentioned the Supreme Court view on section 62, which as it turned out was a very important decision at the time. I still believe that, in justice, a longer minimum period would be better and for that reason I am pushing the amendment.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	I move amendment No. 8:In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:“(12) Where the grounds for a possession application are anti-social behaviour, and in the opinion of the local authority a successful application may increase the chances of a detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the locality of the dwelling to which the tenancy agreement relates in the intervening period between issue and repossession, the local authority concerned may petition the District Court to permit the local authority to act on the possession order no less than 1 month after the order is issued. The District Court will decide on this petition with due regard for ability of the tenant concerned to find alternative accommodation in this period and the potential detrimental effect on the household concerned.”.Where a person is facing eviction for anti-social behaviour I am proposing that the local authority may petition the District Court to permit it to act on the possession order no less than one month after the order is issued. The time factor is important because the chances of these people finding alternative accommodation are affected. They might have children or other factors to take into account including schools etc. Providing for a period of one month after an order is issued is a sensible way of proceeding. We have argued whether the period should be ten or 21 days but if local authorities are allowed any flexibility, they will take the minimum period in cases where they should not. The Minister made an argument earlier that ten working days was the minimum period and that the local authorities could allow a longer period but it is dangerous to allow that to happen. That is the reason for my amendment because not enough time is being allowed for these families to find alternative accommodation.

That is a good idea, but I am concerned about one aspect of the amendment which refers to the District Court being required to have due regard for the ability of the tenant concerned to find alternative accommodation. All of us can speak only from our own experiences. The move by a local authority or a voluntary housing association to seek repossession happens only in extremis, and this legislation reflects the reality that a series of warnings is given and when the situation becomes serious, they move to repossess. In cities and very large urban areas people have a degree of anonymity but in the towns and villages across rural Ireland, when it becomes inevitable that the local authority is seeking a repossession, that will become general knowledge in an area and the person being evicted will more than likely experience real difficulty in sourcing alternative accommodation because the alternative accommodation will be private rented accommodation, which is difficult to source in the first instance and will be inordinately more difficult to source when it is generally known to landlords that the person is being evicted because they have been involved in anti-social activity. The second and only other alternative is some type of hostel accommodation and I would be concerned that in putting that provision into the Bill we give the courts an opportunity to deprive local authorities of an activity of last resort where, in the public interest, somebody must be evicted. I fear we run the risk of somebody going into court and pleading their situation is so well known in the particular area that he or she will not be able to secure alternative accommodation. We have to think of the common good. We have to realise that where people are involved in the sale of drugs, for example, society has a right to say that there is a cost to be paid if, after repeated warnings, the tenant does not wise up and see the light. We have the right to defend the decent, honourable people who are living in these locations. My experience has been a sad one because very often, when faced with the plight of anti-social behaviour, it is the victims, the decent people living in the area, who are driven out and, ultimately, their place is taken by people who are stronger and have the capacity to withstand the pressures. The participants in the anti-social behaviour, however, remain and carry on.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	We are all trying to achieve a fair balance between giving people due warning while at the same time ensuring that where there are serious problems, the local authority has some powers to deal with them. In some ways this amendment is going in the opposite direction to the previous amendment in so far as the Bill states that the housing authority must give the household at least two months before requesting possession on foot of a court order whereas this amendment would allow them to move more quickly in cases of anti-social behaviour. It is a matter of judgment for all of us to decide the length of time that should be given to people in those circumstances. The previous amendment provided for more time to be given to them in the early stages of the process. In this amendment we are giving them less time after the possession order.I would contend that, as provided for in the Bill, two months in respect of a request for possession on foot of a court order is the minimum period required by a household to make arrangements for alternative accommodation. I do not think it is reasonable to provide for a shorter period, even in exceptional cases. Also, if the household refuses to give up possession voluntarily to the housing authority, the District Court must make an execution order whereby possession is effected by a sheriff, which is a process that inevitably takes time. I believe one month is a little short in that it could result in people, who would otherwise have had two months to make alternative arrangements, becoming homeless. Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.

I note Deputy Murphy has tabled a broader amendment on the same subject.  Existing law in regard to excluding orders in respect of tenants engaged in anti-social behaviour makes reference to the housing authority when preparing to make an application for an exclusion order consulting the health board. I am concerned that the Bill in relation to particular matters provides only for consultation with the Health Service Executive and not the Child and Family Agency.  Obviously, people engaged in anti-social behaviour if persistently causing havoc must be excluded from areas. I agree with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that the experience under existing law has been that very often it is the families who are well behaved citizens that end up leaving estates. Often the best of families have to flee having been subjected to grave anti-social behaviour. It is important to remember that under this Bill orders can be made against children aged over 12 years. The question that arises is what is to happen to those children? Obviously, that raises issues around child protection. It is necessary to include an expressed requirement that the housing authority notify the Child and Family Agency in circumstances where excluding orders are being made. Only recently Deputy Murphy made a powerful contribution during Leaders' Questions on the impact of the current housing crisis on children. We are currently, and rightly so, establishing an inquiry into the horrendous treatment of children in decades past in counties such as Galway and others throughout the country while currently before our eyes intelligent young children, whose families are facing eviction, are experiencing great fear and terror at the prospect of moving again or, perhaps, living in a hotel or guesthouse room. That is the current situation. The Government has a huge responsibility to the children of all of those families. In 30 or 40 years time Members of the then Dáil may be looking back and asking what we did about this matter. It is a serious issue.  Amendment No. 11 deals with the necessity for consultation with the Child and Family Agency. I know that like other Members the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, has vast experience in relation to this subject. I am sure she will agree that a multi-agency response to this issue is important. I note Deputy Murphy's amendment, of which I am supportive, goes a little further in this regard.  Amendment No. 13 seeks to amend 19(5)(a) which amends section 3A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, as amended. Section 3A relates to exclusion orders preventing people from entering sites provided by local authorities. I understand section 3A was inserted into the 1997 Act by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, as amended. I support amendment No. 12 and hope that the Minister will be able to accept it and my two modest amendments.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	This amendment was also tabled and discussed on Committee Stage, at which time the Minister said she did not want to direct the courts. I do not want matters to get to the point whereby the courts have to be directed. I think action has to happen at a much earlier stage. The lack of ability to manage local authority estates is part of the problem in that it is seen as exclusively a housing issue. The point I and others are trying to make is that it is more than a housing issue. Often the most vulnerable individuals in estates are being terrorised by a small number of minors. I know of people who have been forced out of estates because of anti-social behaviour. It is these families rather than those that are causing the problem who suffer the consequences. There is a difficulty with minors, particularly when a group of them come together. If there are not consequences for those involved the problem becomes difficult to manage. A particular criticism of the housing associations is that they engage in cherrypicking of tenants, which option is not available to the local authorities as they are required to broadly comply with a points system, even in respect of a family that is known to be a difficult family. What often happens is that an estate that previously was stable becomes intolerable to live in following the allocation in that estate of a house to a particular family. The Minister of State is well aware of this.  Today is a seminal moment in terms of housing policy. While in theory the housing assistance payment provision makes things much easier administratively from the point of view of the landlord and tenant, in the absence of supply housing associations are being turned into housing support agencies and the private sector is where people will in future live. Anti-social behaviour and how it is managed becomes a different issue when that is the case. It may well be that it will become an academic issue because there will not be local authority estates in the future to house the 90,000 plus families on the housing waiting lists.  As I said, the authorities need to get involved in the management of behaviour at a much earlier stage. Eviction of families who are causing problems is simply moving a problem from one place to another. What we really need to do is address the problem at a much earlier stage. There must be a range of consequences for bad behaviour. It is often impossible for families to continue to live beside people who are out of control. There is a need for a multi-agency approach to this issue. That multi-agency approach must include the Child and Family Agency and Garda junior liaison officer.It may well be that health service training programmes are required. I refer to tenant-management systems. It may well be that courses could be run for tenants in order that they gain an understanding of the problems visited on their neighbours. I would prefer intervention at a much earlier stage, rather than going to the courts.

It is relevant in this instance because an exclusion order is sometimes needed against just one individual, not an entire family. Some of the earlier discussion was on the support mechanisms that could be put in place, depending on the age of the individual, in order that the ultimate step of eviction would not be reached. It is a matter of positive engagement and not trying to prevent due process or justice. It is a question of using as many supports as possible in this regard.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	Let me explain exactly what an excluding order for a minor can and cannot do. Under an amendment to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, included in the Bill, an excluding order cannot exclude a minor from the family home. This is critical. What it can do is exclude a minor from being in another house or place such as a green area or set of local shops where anti-social behaviour is known to take place. As responsible, statutory social landlords, it is appropriate for the housing authorities to have power to exclude minors who have engaged in anti-social behaviour from where such behaviour tends to happen or where there is an opportunity to indulge in it. The provision in question is essentially an estate management tool that does not have the effect of removing the minor concerned from his home or locality. I am sorry for using the word "his" as I am sure minors are not all male. I recognise the point Deputies Catherine Murphy, Thomas P. Broughan and Maureen O'Sullivan are making, that is, that there are much wider issues than simply excluding a young person from a particular area. These issues need to be addressed holistically. We addressed this issue on Committee Stage, particularly in dealing with Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment. We are developing communication protocols with the relevant agencies in regard to the Children Act 2001. I agree that we need to do a lot more in this regard. With regard to regeneration, in particular, there is a much more holistic approach to the areas in question which, by and large, are local authority housing estates. There is a very strong social element to regeneration, in addition to the physical element. These are the models we must consider. We see them in RAPID areas and in other provisions. We need to see much more of the type of engagement described, but I am not accepting the amendments because they are specific to the tool of being able to exclude a young person from a specific area where there is trouble - not from their home or immediate community. I am suggesting this is a useful tool, but it involves striking a balance between the rights of the respondent and the rights of the local community. The adjudication on the balance to be struck in an individual case is most appropriately determined by the court which should not be influenced in striking that balance by a statutory provision giving the rights of one party priority over those of the other. I made this point and Deputy Catherine Murphy has referred to it. Unfortunately, therefore, I will not be accepting the amendments.

I cannot see why she cannot accept the amendments. Surely the child could be in danger and his or her behaviour could represent the outward manifestation of a very dysfunctional family that requires attention. We have all been impressed thus far by the prompt action of the Child and Family Agency on a number of matters. I cannot understand why it would be inappropriate to include what we propose, or a multi-agency approach, in the legislation. Surely it would be a safeguard for the child being excluded from a particular area. Is this something the Minister of State could reconsider? I am sorry I was not present on Committee Stage because I am not a member of the committee. I cannot see the harm in including what we propose to ensure, first and foremost, that the child receive whatever attention is necessary when there is an excluding order.

I am interested in learning what can be done practically. Perhaps the Minister of State might revert to us with an indication as to how her Department can be helpful in having a uniform approach nationally to changing the current circumstances. There are perfectly good estates which are getting a very bad name because of a very small number of people. The vast majority of residents are happy to live their lives without engaging in anti-social behaviour. We cannot let this go simply by saying one must up one's game at local authority level; more is needed. It is not just a question of communication but also of designing some consequences of bad behaviour.

I am thinking of my background in youth services. When I consider youth services in the north inner city, I note the excellent work they are doing with challenging youth through youth clubs, youth projects, Garda diversion projects and the JLO system. This is at the preventive stage and we are looking way down the line. Again, we do not pay enough heed to preventive measures. Some of the issues about which we are talking might not need to be talked about if more emphasis was placed on preventive measures. I hope Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, as Minister of State responsible for housing, can urge the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ensure no further cuts to the services that are preventing young people from engaging in anti-social behaviour or that catch youths at a stage when they can be drawn back.

I do not see any harm in it. We have all experienced cases in which people were excluded from certain areas, including parks. It is important that community projects, social workers and outreach workers be kept informed in this regard. There are existing rules for informing the relevant authorities. What is being proposed will reinforce the system. The authorities will be able to ensure the people in question, particularly the younger ones, will be directed in the right direction, not just excluded from an area. We have witnessed so many times that, regardless of whether we like it, they gravitate back towards the area. There should be an alternative place to go to. All one is doing is pushing people into breaking the order in the first place.

However, I am planning to meet the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on the risk of homelessness among young people. I am willing to talk to him about how we can engage on the issues of housing and the under-18s. I will revert to the Deputy in a different forum rather than under this legislation, if that is acceptable.

It proposes simply that every time a new relevant Bill is published, tenancy agreements have to be updated. The amendment allows only for what is revised in terms of repossessing in this Bill to be included in the reviews of tenancy agreements, and the tenant will then not be left with less favourable terms.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	The amendment relates to a new section 29A proposed to be inserted into the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 that empowers the Minister to prescribe amendments to terms of existing local authority tenancy agreements that are consequential to new or existing legislative provisions. It would not be appropriate to limit the application of this new section to procedures for repossessing dwellings only, as proposed by the amendment, as there is a range of terms of existing agreements that will need to be updated over time to reflect existing and future legislative changes. Without the proposed section included in the Bill, existing tenancy agreements needing updating to reflect legislative provisions would have to be terminated individually and the tenants offered a new tenancy agreement containing updated terms and conditions. I suggest this is a very cumbersome way of updating tenancy agreements and could cause unfounded worry for tenants. The section 29A approach is much preferable, involving the Minister prescribing the changes to be made to existing agreements arising from specific enactments, and housing authorities inserting the changes into the tenancy agreements and notifying the tenants accordingly. The second part of the amendment seeks to confine the operation of the new section 29A to changes that are more favourable for tenants than their existing terms. I cannot accept this restriction on the application of the new section because it would rule out using the procedure for estate management changes to existing agreements that might be less favourable for individual tenants but much more beneficial for the residents of an estate as a whole. An example of this would be changes to tenancy agreements for apartments where new conditions relating to household behaviour could improve the quality of life of everyone living in the apartment complex concerned. I hope that makes sense to the Deputy.

The local authority on successful repossession of a dwelling will as far as is practicable ensure that:(a) any refurbishment works required will be tendered for within 1 month of repossession date,(b) in the case where only minor refurbishment work is required the dwelling must be reallocated within 3 months of repossession date,(c) where substantial refurbishment is required the dwelling will be reallocated for habitation not more than 1 month from the completion of refurbishment works.”.Since 2008 onwards, a huge number of voids have been building up and, until recently, there were roughly 1,800 voids. I know the Minister of State is making moves to deal with that but, from here on, we need to be sure that when we repossess units, they will be tendered for within one month of repossession. The amendment also proposes that in cases where there is only minor refurbishment work, the dwelling must be reallocated within three months of the repossession date. Where substantial refurbishment is required, the dwelling must be reallocated for habitation not more than one month from the completion of refurbishment works. We need to have targets. The natural progression that happened over the years, when people either died, left tenancies or the tenancies were repossessed, went by the wayside due to lack of funding. This is why we have been left with a build-up of voids. In some local authority areas, voids have been sitting there for three to six months and longer, which is not acceptable given the current crisis. I am trying to put down a marker which the Minister of State and the local authorities can aim at and use as a guide.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	The amendment allows me to question the Minister of State in regard to the whole area of refurbishment of vacant units throughout the country. I note the Taoiseach spoke about this yesterday, in particular about his own worries and fears, despite being in office for the last three years, about the length of time it was taking for those houses to be made available by local authorities to suitable tenants, notwithstanding the spiralling housing waiting lists throughout the country. It is that area I want to address. I know the Minister of State has made funds available specifically to local authorities to address those issues and for a refurbishment programme of vacant units. However, until such time as individual local authorities notify me and others of the inroads, if any, that may be made into those distressing figures, by virtue of the funds that have been made available, I want to know what are the Government's plans other than that. Some local authorities, such as my own, always reallocated the funds garnered from tenant purchase schemes to the refurbishment of existing units. I have made proposals in recent times to the Minister of State where families of those on waiting lists, who might be allocated such a unit, would have the availability of expertise within their own families to refurbish these units. Perhaps the tenancy agreement could reflect this and the rent could obviously reflect the works carried out. Is it not something like that, something outside the box, that needs to be done by the Minister of State and her Department in an effort to address this grave problem that exists in the absence of adequate funding to make them suitable for families? Is the Minister of State aware at this stage, having made the allocation to the local authorities, of the inroads that will be made? Is she aware of the continued absence of funding? Is she aware how many units specifically within each local authority area will not be dealt with because of the lack of available funding? That being the case, what proposals has she, if any, to address this issue in a more meaningful manner in the future? While this does not fall within the remit of the Bill before the House, given this is such a serious debate and given the huge crisis in the provision of housing for those on waiting lists throughout the country, she might be able to indicate she is considering such schemes, options or initiatives which might better address the problem, rather than the age-old action of throwing money at it, especially in the absence of adequate funding to address that very issue.

If anything, he has been generous in the timescales he is allowing. I want to ask a very specific question. Is it the case that the Department is currently or was previously operating a scheme whereby local authorities could apply for funding to the Department for a house, provided it was vacant for six months? Was it the case that this scheme encouraged local authorities to leave the houses empty for that period of time in order to avail of funding from the Department, as distinct from having to spend their own resources, if they had any, on particular housing programmes?
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment because if the Government and the local authorities are not able to deal with this issue, then they do not have a hope of dealing with the housing crisis, given we are talking about houses that are existing, vacant and in public ownership. In the case of every single person on the housing list, the first thing they raise with any councillor or Deputy is the number of boarded up houses they see. It is a huge source of anger for people on waiting lists. As a public representative over a period of time, I know there are sometimes complex reasons that these houses cannot be acquired and turned over, and we all know there may be legal issues and so on.However, the reality is that the inability of the State to deal with these houses that have been boarded up over long periods of time is a real reflection of its lack of urgency in respect of the housing crisis. The councils' insistence on gutting the houses is a real problem. It is well reported by many housing tenants that kitchens, presses and units are taken out by local authorities when they do not need to be taken out. This policy must be reviewed, given the current crisis. Sometimes it is done for safety reasons. We are told it is not possible to leave particular lino or tiles behind. It was raised again with me last night at a public meeting in Blanchardstown by people on the housing list. They asked me why this is continuing. They know the council is wasting time carrying out all these renovations when a person would happily move into the house and make whatever adjustments are required themselves. Cuts in funding are the real reason these houses are lying vacant over long periods of time. It relates to cuts in staff, which means that tradesmen and tradeswomen are not available, and cuts in funding for necessary works. If the Government is serious about doing anything about the housing crisis, one would expect that the first thing it would do is to provide the money and staffing to get these houses turned over very quickly. One would expect an announcement to be made, so I imagine that the Minister of State will agree to this amendment.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	I have spoken to the Minister of State about the procurement process, which has been part of the delay. Some of that may have been overcome at this stage because there are now lists of contractors who can be called upon. I heard about it from staff within the local authority in Kildare. They were tearing their hair out over the delay. They wanted to get work done on the 49 vacant houses in Kildare. One could have put tenants in every one of them ten times over and one would still not have dealt with all the people who are in an urgent situation. Could the Minister of State tell us something about that procurement process? Am I correct in saying there has been some improvement? I do not doubt that anyone would make the same point as I am making, but when houses are vacant they often suffer further damage. Putting in shutters is very expensive. I remember hearing that it cost a couple of hundred euro per month. If one replicates this around the country, it represents a very large cost which must be added to the cost of rent assistance. It makes economic and social sense to turn these houses over quickly. Deputy Coppinger referred to the point of view of homeless people who see shuttered houses when they say they will take anything in any condition - even something smaller than their family would need. It causes offence to people in need of housing. I would be interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say about the procurement process.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	332	I warmly support the amendment in the name of Deputy Ellis. It is extremely frustrating for communities, particularly people on housing lists, and public representatives to see homes being boarded up month after month. Questions arose in the Dublin City Council administrative area about the efficiency of the maintenance departments in councils and the effectiveness of their estate management, because some boarded-up houses would have been houses that families subjected to terrible antisocial behaviour had had to flee - for example, corner houses in badly designed estates, particularly those designed in the 1970s and 1980s. There are many issues around this but most people would feel that targets for local authorities should be enshrined in a housing Bill. The Minister of State told me yesterday that there are 3,016 vacant properties across the 31 new city and county councils. She told me she had allocated €15 million in April 2014 to refurbish 952, or approximately one-third, of those properties. I note that she allocated €3.3 million to Dublin City Council for 135 units and €1.26 million to Fingal County Council for 95 properties. I note that the new chief executive of Fingal County Council, Paul Reid, told me that the council is hoping to refurbish 120 vacant properties. I also note that 49 refurbishments are planned in County Kildare, at a cost of €700,000, and 12 refurbishments are planned in County Offaly, at a cost of €250,000. However one does the sums, the bottom line is that it is not enough money. The Minister of State said yesterday that she would provide a further €20 million for vacant units, but this still means that up to one-third of the units will still lie vacant for a lengthy period. As many Deputies have said, we have heard the refrain "Let me into that house and we will refurbish it," for years and years. People talk about how they have carpenters, brickies or plasterers in the family. We have heard that plaintive plea for a home down through the years. I strongly support the amendment.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	I welcome Deputy Coppinger. On Second Stage, when she was not a Member of the House, we had many contributions relating to people's absolute frustration at seeing houses they could be living in lying empty for years and seeing kitchens being thrown out when they were on the housing waiting list. It is something that everybody in this House feels very strongly about, regardless of our political persuasions. I allocated that funding, which will bring over 1,700 vacant units back into use. As Deputy Broughan noted, the first tranche was for 952 units. There is a further €20 million. We have specifically allocated the first tranche and we know exactly how many units it is to cover in each local authority estate. They must report back to me when they have done it. It is for individual houses and apartments. It is not just a lump of money that they can do whatever they like with. It is for specific houses and we must see that it is done within a specific timeframe. The second tranche has not yet been allocated because we want another report from the councils telling us exactly what units they will refurbish with this money so that we can track it and make sure it is properly spent. There was a problem identified by Deputy Ó Fearghaíl relating to the previous scheme, which finished at the end of 2012. In 2013, the money for retrofitting was for occupied houses, but up to then, the houses had to be vacant for six months before they got the funding. Local authorities were leaving houses empty for six months so that they would get the funding. We are trying to be as clever as we can be in ensuring that the money is actually spent on bringing units back into use and then allocating them.  I understand where Deputy Ellis is coming from in terms of the amendments. One of the reasons I cannot accept them relates to the point raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy about tendering. This amendment states that any refurbishment works required will be tendered for within one month of the repossession date. What is happening with regard to procurement is that most local authorities have a framework in place so they do not have to go through the normal tendering process. There are still some local authorities that do not have this framework in place. I can probably find out which ones do not have it, but most of them do have it, so they can move relatively quickly with the companies they have on their books to carry out, for example, small retrofitting jobs. In this way, they do not have to go through the normal tendering process and can move more quickly.Most of them are using this process under the retrofitting and vacant properties schemes. The amendment is prescriptive in defining timelines for housing authorities in respect of a number of actions, with some of which it might be impossible for them to comply. The extent of refurbishment works required to a property should be the measure that determines the timeline as to when it might be available for reallocation to a new tenant and while this is reflected somewhat in the Deputy's text, it does not account for the availability or lack thereof of resources to finance the works involved. In some cases, where the works are extensive, funding may be required from my Department. An example is the funding I announced recently. It is more difficult to be as prescriptive as the Deputy, but I understand from where he is coming and I am determined to speed up the process. We are examining whether we can adopt a mandatory process as part of a carrot and stick approach. We may need a stick, given that the funding we have allocated is the carrot. I have also sought legal advice on the issues raised by local authorities. They state, for example, that they cannot let the house if the previous tenant has installed a particular appliance, cupboard and so on in case somebody is hurt by them. They are worried about the legal implications in this regard; therefore, I am seeking advice to ensure I can be specific about what they can and cannot do in the context of their legal obligations.

It is my experience as someone directly involved in voluntary housing provision that we do not have to turn to the Department or the local authority to seek funds to refurbish our houses when tenancies are being renewed. The fact that the Minister of State is doing what she is doing indicates that local authorities are not prudently and effectively managing their stock in so far as they have to turn to her to seek funding. If they filled the vacancies expeditiously and did not have houses lying idle, leading to a scenario in which they are vandalised, and if there was effective on the ground management, with prudent management of stock maintenance and the funds generated from rents, surely this operation would be self-financing. I am aware of many houses being refurbished and because there was a delay in their reallocation, they were vandalised again.

They also have had delegated sanction to use their internal capital receipts for housing purposes since 1 January 2007, subject to terms and conditions. They are, therefore, supposed to use their income from tenant purchases and rents to maintain housing stock. Other parties have many more councillors than my party since the local elections.

Even in the past few years, there have been cutbacks. While a stimulus package was announced, the budget was reduced by €60 million this year. The Minister of State has announced measures that will ameliorate this to some extent. She is addressing a number of voids across the country and trying to sort them out, but we need to adopt measures for the future to make sure this does not happen again. That requires resources. The amendment would set down rules for the future. I have outlined a number of areas in which they could be applied. I am aware of houses being boarded up for one year, with neighbours going made because of the anti-social behaviour and other problems this generates. That is unacceptable. The problems vary across local authorities. Some are worse than others in this regard. What I have outlined in my amendment is conservative, as even Fianna Fáil has acknowledged, which must be a compliment. We need to provide resources and prescribe the timeframes I have provided for in the amendment because there is such a crisis that we cannot afford to fail to do so. When a local authority is short of money, these targets are needed in the context of repossessions and so on.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I move amendment No. 16:In page 37, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “(4) A housing authority shall ensure that, unless otherwise directed by resolution of the elected members of the local authority to which the housing authority is subject, 100 per cent of the proceeds garnered from the sale of a house under this Part shall be retained by the local authority for the specific purpose of providing further accommodation.”.I realise that local authorities are empowered to retain the funds in their areas but, and I asked this question on Committee Stage and I am not convinced I received an answer, do the balances of the local authorities contribute towards the general Government deficit? This amendment deals with a key issue. If we are to maintain the extent of the housing stock, it is essential that this money is re-used to provide replacement housing, whether that comes in the form of a new house or through refurbishing other houses. The quantity of housing is the issue. I read the executive summary of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report that was produced yesterday. It states that the fund for social housing provision on the necessary scale will require the creation of public housing institutions capable of attracting finance without adding to the national debt, and that such housing providers would require an adequate rental income stream. Essentially, it is referring to a mixture of people who are at work and people who are not at work and who would be unable to pay significant rents. This legislation is being presented in the absence of us knowing what the future holds in terms of the prospects for the more than 90,000 on the housing lists, with another more than 10,000 people likely to be added to the lists with the number of repossessions coming down the tracks. If it is the case that we will not see large-scale social housing being provided, are we seeing here an attempt to gather an income? How will that income be spent? In future, will social housing provision be exclusively the preserve of private entities, with the market the main provider of social housing? If that is to be the case and unless there are caps on the amount of rent that can be sought, there will be a serious problem with people having to source that accommodation themselves and the issue of how that housing is managed. It also has consequences down the line for children. The number of houses that can be provided from ring-fencing this fund will be a small contribution. The Minister said she will introduce a scheme that will be related to people's income. When does she think that scheme might be introduced and how does she envisage it being introduced?
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I will speak to amendment No. 17, which relates to section 23. I have always believed that if we sell local authority housing to tenants, the purchase money should be ring-fenced for housing. We should not deplete our housing stock. There should be a means of ring-fencing the money for that and for the maintenance of existing local authority housing stock. The money should be targeted on those two areas. For too long local authorities have been incrementally getting rid of and depleting their housing stock. That is an awful shame. Housing provision is being pushed to voluntary housing. The lead in delivering housing should be taken by the local authority, but the road we are taking is driving us more towards voluntary housing. In amendment No. 17 I am asking that we ring-fence this money, which is something on which we should all agree, and in certain cases it could be used for maintenance. That is crucial.

In amendment No. 18 I am saying to the Minister that by not including voluntary housing in the Bill she is missing a golden opportunity to recognise that an injustice is being perpetrated on the tenants of voluntary housing associations. If their houses were built after 2010, they cannot buy their properties. The 2009 Act made provision for an incremental purchase scheme for local authority houses and for identified voluntary housing units. I do not know if any voluntary housing units were built after 2009. There were not many local authority units built. When I asked my local authority this morning how many houses had been sold in County Kildare under the incremental purchase scheme I was told "none". We welcome the concept of a purchase scheme in principle. I was a great advocate of the old traditional tenant purchase scheme which had an element of discount and which people understood and used to great effect throughout the country. People got a local authority house, their circumstances improved, they bought the house, built onto it, raised their family and everybody was happy. However, I believe approximately 20,000 units across the country were delivered by voluntary housing associations under the capital loan and subsidy scheme, CLSS. I am not referring to the capital assistance scheme, CAS, units and the specialised units that were built for people with disabilities, elderly people and so forth. There is a need to retain the ownership of those units with the voluntary bodies that built them. However, where the other voluntary housing associations are concerned, the people who were housed in those units had no other choice. In many instances they were recommended to the voluntary housing association by the local authority. They saw themselves as getting a house but they did not know at the time they were getting it that they were condemning themselves to an indefinite period of renting. In Kildare we developed the voluntary sector as a self-help initiative. In some places in County Kildare there are locally based voluntary housing associations where the people came together to form the association. The association then went on to build houses on an agency basis for the county council. In the same estate there is a level of integration, where there are voluntary units and the units built for the county council on an agency basis. People can buy the county council houses but the people in the voluntary units who came from the same housing list and benefited from the same source of funding, which was 100% grant aid from the Department, cannot buy their houses. One of the Minister's predecessors, former Deputy Michael Finneran, introduced the incremental purchase scheme.Mrs. Thatcher, of whom I am no great admirer, delivered social housing in Britain by way of the voluntary housing associations, which is why Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct to say we must be careful to avoid a situation where the local authorities cease to be the housing agencies and we offload the entire responsibility onto voluntary housing associations. It may in some respects be a misnomer to describe them as voluntary given that they are large commercial enterprises in respect of which there has been a degree of empire building. These very large bodies which are themselves opposed to a tenant purchase scheme should not be allowed to deprive people of an opportunity to purchase their properties. Amendment No. 18 asks that common sense prevail. It seeks to put in place a tenant purchase scheme to allow people to buy homes out in the same way as people who avail of local authority housing can do and to ring-fence the funding so that it all goes back in to provide further social housing locally or, in exceptional cases, to refurbish houses, should that be necessary.

It relates to the fact that the core problem in providing the social housing desperately needed by 100,000 families is finance. It is all about finance. If one looks at the medium-term review, which the outgoing Secretary General at the Department of Finance keeps telling us to read, one can see that it is planned that there will be very little money. It looks as though the Government that is elected in 2016 will have a much easier time in terms of managing fiscal targets to 2020, according to this medium-term review. Even at that, very little money is available for social housing. I note that the issue was addressed today in the report by the National Economic and Social Council entitled "Social Housing at the Crossroads: Possibilities for Investment, Provision and Cost Rental". That body is right to draw attention to the fact that because social housing is included in the general Government deficit, it is virtually impossible for people who accepted the blanket bank guarantee and the remit of the troika to raise funds for social housing. If one looks at our EU partner countries such as Sweden and France, one will see that in those countries local authorities and public corporations can access funding to provide social housing outside the general governmental deficit and funding structures. One of the issues mentioned in the NESC report is the necessity for a new public corporation to dramatically transform NAMA into an organisation which seriously begins to address the housing crisis. Certainly, it has access to the kind of funding that is necessary. I remember, as will the Acting Chairman, that in the late 1980s, the then Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government abandoned the provision of large-scale social housing. It simply walked away from it. I remember, as the leader of the local authority, leading a walk-out of councillors from an address being given by the then Minister responsible for the environment portfolio, Mr. Michael Smith. He was totally abandoning the process whereby over a number of decades, local authorities - and his own party in the 1930s - were able to provide in one of the poorest countries in Europe a significant tranche of social housing across cities, towns and rural areas. That was abandoned by Fianna Fáil's Haughey-MacSharry Government in the late 1980s as well as by subsequent Governments. The Acting Chairman knows well that we laboured here for 14 long, bitter years even though the country was building 100,000 units per year in a mad, frantic alliance of Government, developers and banks which brought us to an incredible tragedy in 2008. Social housing provision was minuscule and families who were waiting were dealt with in an unregulated and contemptuous manner. The lists built up and up, and we have seen the results in the last six years. This is a very significant amendment which addresses the core of the problem. We must put significant finance into this. The Minister of State has spoken about providing 4,000 units, rising to 6,000, but we need much more. We need to declare a housing emergency and to place a cap on rents in the private sector. We need strong action by a vigorous Government. Unfortunately, the Government, which seems to be outgoing in terms of its personnel, did not deliver, as was the case with its predecessor, which left us with the terrible tragedy we are experiencing. The amendment is well timed.

It is a limited amount of money and not the kind of funding needed to address the entire social housing need. Nevertheless, a general discussion has arisen in this context. Deputies Catherine Murphy and Tommy Broughan raised the issue of the NESC report. It is not my report but that body's, and it was submitted for consideration. We need to consider all of the various possibilities and options, and NESC is a recognised body which has representations across a variety of sectors. The fact that it has published a report does not mean I will implement all of it, however. It includes ideas on social renting, etc., that are new to Ireland, and we must at least look at them. However, I would much prefer to be building local authority houses through the local authority and not-for-profit sectors. I am not particularly enthusiastic about private entities becoming involved at all. This is for discussion, and I am delighted that so many people here have actually read it. There are other documents coming down the line, including from the Housing Agency, which is doing work on the lower end of the rental market. Other documents will be feeding into the public debate, which is a necessary one. I will not go back into attacking Fianna Fáil about the bank guarantee, but Deputy Broughan made the point that the general Government deficit includes provision of direct funding for housing. Unfortunately, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I must live with that. We have targets to reach. I do not want to waste too much time on this, but I note that I have simply not had the funding to deliver a large-scale social housing programme.

With regard to the specific amendments, there are some different points in the third of the three amendments. With regard to the first two, I said on Committee Stage that they duplicate an existing enactment in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Section 13 of the Act provides that capital moneys accruing to the housing authority from a number of sources, including the sale of a dwelling under the old tenant purchase schemes provided by the 1966 Act or the two incremental purchase schemes provided for in the 2009 Act, will be ring-fenced in a separate account and, subject to the Minister's prior approval, used for the provision of housing or for the refurbishment or maintenance of existing houses or related purposes. Such provisions refer to the local authorities' internal capital receipts. Furthermore, section 32(a) amends section 13 of the 2009 Act to provide that moneys accruing from the sale of the dwelling under Part 3 of the Bill will be subject to the provisions of section 13. It is there already. Since 2007, local authorities have had delegated sanction to use their internal capital receipts for housing purposes, subject to certain terms and conditions. Under these procedures, authorities are required to submit an annual programme of works to be funded by the internal capital receipts, primarily consisting of planned maintenance and improvement of their existing housing stock, for approval by my Department. It has also been agreed that local authorities can use their internal receipts to augment the funding used to finance the authorities' funding from its own resources of the suite of grants for older persons and people with disabilities. Regarding amendment No. 18 and approved housing bodies, I take the points being made but, whether we like it or not, approved housing bodies are the approved de facto owners of the properties and they are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement. My Department cannot unilaterally make legal provision for their sale to tenants. Any such decision must involve the approved housing body and have regard to the mortgage on the property. I cannot do it legally because the State does not own the property; it is owned by the approved housing body. Whether that can be examined in the future, in terms of money being allocated, is another point, but under the current circumstances I cannot do it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy asked me about the new tenant purchase scheme and what is likely to be in it. In order to qualify for purchase under the scheme, a tenant must be in receipt of social housing support for a minimum prescribed period of not less than one year and have a prescribed minimum gross annual income. The purchase price of the house will be based on its market value and its existing condition and state of repair, although it will be subject to a minimum price that takes account of the cost to the housing authority of replacing the house being sold. The detail will be by way of regulation and I have not yet taken a final decision on it. The likely model will be the existing incremental purchase schemes, which provide for discounts of 60%, 50% or 40% of the purchase price depending on tenant income. That is the current state of play.

Therefore, it is possible. I take the point made by the Minister of State that we cannot force the voluntary housing associations that own the housing units to sell the units to their tenants. However, at present, if such voluntary housing associations want to sell units to the tenants, they cannot do so because the legislation prohibits them from doing so. All I am asking of the Minister of State is to include a provision in the Bill, as drafted in these amendments, to allow the sale of houses where the voluntary housing association and the local authority are of the opinion that it is beneficial to the tenants and the overall welfare of the local community that the sale take place. The differentiation we make is not that the Minister of State forces voluntary housing associations to sell units but that the Minister of State enacts legislation to allow voluntary associations, where there is agreement with the local authority, to sell units. A predecessor of the Minister of State, Deputy Emmet Stagg, who may have been the first Minister of State with responsibility for housing, promised faithfully to do something about this. The reality is that powerful voluntary housing lobbies have been used to prevent the introduction of such a scheme. Natural justice and the interest of the communities involved should outweigh the desire on the part of any voluntary body to build an empire. Having come off the same lists and having availed of the same taxpayers' money, people should have the same opportunity to purchase.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I agree with the amendments. The following point arises from a suggestion made to me by someone on the list in my area. In expanding tenant purchase, we could provide for people on the list to have the possibility of getting a loan from the local authority to build a house. It is something to examine. As well as being able to purchase a local authority house, we should consider the category of people on the list who are working and qualify for the list and who, if they were given cheap finance and land by the local authority, could come off the list and build their houses. This would relieve some of the pressure on housing lists, free up spaces on the list and provide housing for people who need housing but cannot afford it on the open market. I ask the Minister of State to think about that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I take the point made by Deputy Sean Ó Fearghaíl about the difference between amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 and the point about people being offered accommodation through the housing associations. This results in a dramatic change in respect of their opportunity to purchase in the future. I have heard that point several times. I refer to the point made by the Minister of State in respect of social renting. A third option is needed. I do not dispute some of the points made by the NESC report, which are valid and represent a good contribution. The local authority will continue and should continue to have a function and it should be a function where there is a large-scale option. I do not agree with the notion that all Irish people want to own their homes. Most people want to have security of tenure and, if they are renting, they want to rent a home, particularly if there are children involved, where there is stability and where they can set down roots. Most people, particularly when children are involved, do not want to rent someone else's property when the latter has almost all of the control in respect of security of tenure. We must have a different debate about a third option.It is probably good there will be a mixture of people renting within that kind of environment. However, where people have been allocated a house within a housing or voluntary association, the expectation had been there that if they wanted to, they could purchase that house at some point in the future. They did not have to take up that option, but it was available. If it is necessary to go back and talk to the larger housing associations to provide for this, which it appears it is, that should be done. 
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	Deputy Ó Fearghaíl spoke on amendment No. 18, but I wish to comment on the Minister's response on amendments Nos. 16 and 17, which we support. The Minister of State said that under legislation, the Minister has authority to give consent to the local authority to retain the funds or proceeds from tenant purchase schemes for dispersal within the housing section of that local authority. I respect this, but notwithstanding the provision, does the Minister not believe that the authority of the Minister may be somewhat undermined by virtue of the powers that exist for the Economic Management Council, EMC, at this time? That being the case, the direction of that body might be that all Ministers return funds from any such schemes for dispersal by central Government. It is against this background we disagree with the Minister of State's response on the proposed amendment. Is she not of the same opinion as us, that the real power within Cabinet is that of the Economic Management Council, as we saw to our cost in regard to the process of the setting up of Irish Water? We saw the underhand manner in which the EMC withheld information from the rest of Cabinet in regard to the way in which funds were drawn down from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and saw the lack of accountability to this House regarding funds derived from that body and the manner in which it was done. This left the public at large without recourse to adequate responses in regard to that whole process. It is against this background that I urge caution on the part of the Minister of State in this instance to feel she can hide behind the existing legislation which states it is at the discretion of the Minister to allow those funds be retained. I fear that power may be usurped by the authority of the EMC.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	I see no reason for amendments Nos. 16 and 17 not to be accepted. I do not accept what the Minister of State has said, that this is already provided for in legislation. We all know that any income that comes in to a local authority is taken into account when it comes to local government funding. Often this money is put on the central books and we end up with less money for local government funding. There is an issue also in regard to Dublin City Council flats. No progress has been made in terms of selling these flats. The last thing I want to see is social housing coming off the lists, but any money received in regard to such housing sales must be ringfenced. There is nothing wrong with seeking ringfencing of this money and if there is no demand for further social housing, the money could be used for the maintenance of existing local housing stock. This must be stated specifically in the Bill. The previous Act mentions money may be used for "related purposes or otherwise", which leaves a way for the money to be used elsewhere. This is unacceptable, because we must replace stock. The situation is so urgent we must do that.

Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned loans to build. Rural Deputies have suggested this, particularly where people have land on which they wish to build. In regard to the issue raised by Deputy Ellis, on Committee Stage I undertook to come back on the issue of the sale of maisonettes. Part IV of the 2009 Act included provision for a scheme for the tenant purchase of apartments in a designated local authority complex, provided the sale comprised at least five apartments. The reason for the minimum complex size is that the apartment sale scheme involves the establishment of a management company, which the Law Reform Commission indicated in 2008 is not the appropriate owner and management mechanism for smaller residential complexes with limited shared areas and services. The effect of this is that while larger maisonette type developments may be eligible for designation under the apartment sale scheme, small developments will not qualify. I realise this is not the issue the Deputy just raised, but it was raised on Committee Stage by Deputy Boyd Barrett.

I do not know whether we can look to see if there is a way around this. It has to do with common areas and the need for estate management, in compliance with the judgment of the Law Reform Commission. Perhaps we can come back to that later. I am satisfied that the issues raised in amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are dealt with already in legislation. In regard to the approved housing bodies, I am advised they legally retain the right not to sell, because they are the owners of the properties, irrespective of how they were funded. I accept the point that in some cases these bodies were 100% funded. These bodies are the owners of the properties and that is the reason we will not accept the amendment.

What we are saying is that the legislation, as it is structured, prevents them from selling, even if they want to sell, but let the Minister of State correct me if I am wrong. Will she change the legislation so that if they are willing to sell and if the local authority in the area is of the view they should sell, this will be possible? We want her to enable this to happen, not to continue to prohibit the sale of such housing. We want her to reflect the provisions that were made in the incremental purchase scheme that was introduced in the 2009 Act. I made reference earlier to Margaret Thatcher, God between us and all harm. When she introduced this system of voluntary housing development, initially there was a ban on the sale of these houses, but when John Major became Prime Minister of Britain, the situation changed and the people who occupied the houses were given the opportunity to purchase them. We ask the Minister of State to be as inspired as John Major was and to take steps to do something about this now.

The greatest example of how information was withheld from the rest of the Cabinet came at a time when the EMC saw fit to take funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in the matter of the setting up of Irish Water.That meant that no Member of this House could ask questions pertaining to how those funds had been spent because of the legislation governing the taking of funds from the NPRF. Had they been taken from elsewhere, we would have been able to ask questions and received answers much earlier than was ultimately the case.

While we support many aspects of the Bill and love the Minister of State for introducing them, I am appalled to find a provision that effectively excludes people who are in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, from local authority housing waiting lists. The HAP is a positive development and the Minister of State is to be commended for integrating responsibility for the totality of housing provision in local authorities. It makes sense to give them responsibility for dealing with the old rent subsidy and the change in title to "HAP" is understandable, but the Minister of State will need to engage forcefully with county and city managers to ensure they invest the necessary resources in housing departments to operate this system. In the past two decades, in particular, housing provision at local authority level was not given the priority it deserved or warranted. When substantial funding was available for construction programmes, sufficient personnel were not allocated to housing departments to allow them to deliver on these programmes. The HAP is a good idea and the Minister of State is moving in the right direction, but she needs to engage with county and city managers to ensure they provide the necessary personnel to allow the system to work effectively. It is incomprehensible that, under this section of the Bill, receipt of the HAP means someone has had his or her housing needs met. A couple of times my local authority has received a message from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the effect that, when someone receives a rental accommodation scheme, RAS, payment, enters temporary RAS accommodation or avails of a long-term leasing arrangement through a voluntary housing association, his or her housing need should be deemed to have been met and, consequently, he or she should be removed from its waiting list. The Department has also told my local authority that, after responsibility for the HAP has transferred to it and the scheme has become operational, those in receipt of it should be deemed to have had their housing needs met. There are 90,000 plus people on waiting lists, but the number could be as high as 100,000. Of these, 77,000 are in receipt of rent allowance. As the HAP system is developed and rolled out across the country, they will be moved to it from the rent subsidy scheme.I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but they will then be deemed to have had their housing need met. That is appalling beyond belief. The Minister is setting about "disappearing" 70,000 people into the ether. As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, she will get great plaudits for having reduced the housing list - she will virtually wipe it out - but people's need will continue. I am very concerned that people will be condemned to an indefinite period of living in temporary accommodation where the fulfilment of their needs is at the whim of private landlords who can decide to increase the rent, move them out if they will not pay the increased rent, sell the property or whatever. That was never the tradition in this country. Even in the worst of times we allocated money for the construction of local authority housing. We introduced purchase schemes which allowed people to build. We introduced the rent subsidy scheme, which is costing approximately €500 million, effectively as an interim measure between homelessness and local authority housing. The Taoiseach referred to the NESC report in the House during the week. He said we would no longer have the opportunity or be in a position to provide the sort of funding for social housing that we have provided in the past and that we need to have a conversation about what we are going to do. This Fine Gael-led Government is more right wing than we have seen in many years, but the last thing the Irish people would have expected is that the Labour Party would be complicit in bringing forward a proposal that effectively seeks to deprive people of the opportunity to continue to be on a local authority housing waiting list. I believe the Minister of State said in committee and elsewhere that it is her intention that people should be able to move from the RAS, long-term leasing or the HAP, but if there is no longer a list, and the local authorities operate a scheme of letting priorities which is based primarily on the length of time one has spent on the waiting list, the people who avail, through necessity, of these temporary measures - RAS, which is five years, long-term leasing, which is ten or more years, or the HAP, which inevitably will be short-term - are depriving themselves of the opportunity of a long-term solution into the future.  This legislation makes no sense. It is not good legislation and it will be enormously detrimental to Irish society, condemning many people to remain in a situation in which they are living in uncertainty and their ability to avail of educational, employment and other opportunities is greatly reduced. This legislation, more than any other legislation that I have seen in my period in this House, effectively widens the gap between rich and poor and creates a situation in which the poor will be made much poorer.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	I am sorry about that. I do not know whether we are learning lessons. There are approximately 70,000 people on rent supplement and just under 30,000 on the RAS. We have seen what has happened with rent supplement in terms of the number of people now reporting as homeless and the number being put off the housing list and having to seek rent supplement. We learned today that rent supplement will be increased. Obviously, we will now see private landlords further increase prices, but excluding people who take up the housing assistance payment from the housing list does not make sense. That is what we did when the rent supplement scheme was introduced. We said the person would get another RAS property or a house from the local authority, but that has not happened, and even people on the RAS have ended up homeless. That is the reality on the ground. In terms of what will happen with the HAP, we will reduce the numbers on the waiting lists, but the HAP is not long-term housing. Landlords can decide at some stage to pull the plug, so to speak, whether under the HAP or under the rent supplement scheme. We are dealing now with the HAP, which will go to the local authorities. While there are some merits in the HAP going to the local authorities - because people will be allowed to work, which is a positive move - something similar happened under the RAS in that people were allowed to work but some still became homeless and others were put out of their homes. We are spending approximately €300 million on rent supplement. We will be doing the same in terms of private landlords, and it will be paid by the local authorities. We should be investing in social housing. We have a crisis which will become worse, with more people coming onto the housing waiting lists. It appears this measure will massage the figures because many people will be taken off the housing waiting list, which is almost 90,000. How many people will come off that list as a result of this measure? It is wrong. It is not permanent housing. It is not giving people the stability they need. People have to live locally and get to schools. It is wrong that we are allowing this to happen. My fear is that it will not change the situation in terms of the way landlords have behaved simply because it will go to the local authorities. In many ways it appears to be a good way forward, but I cannot agree with taking people off the housing list.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	442	I strongly support my colleague, Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, in recommending this amendment. As he has said, this is nothing but a sleight of hand. It is a gross misrepresentation of the facts, and that is what will ensue. There are almost 100,000 people on housing waiting lists throughout the country and they are entitled to, and would expect, a permanent solution to their problems. This measure offers a temporary solution. Why then should it be represented as a permanent solution when plainly it is not? That is not to detract or deflect from what the Minister of State has proposed regarding the HAP. It is a temporary solution. It is a stepping stone to a more permanent solution, and if that is the thrust of what the Minister of State is proposing, why has she not included in the Bill wording to the effect that nobody who avails of the HAP system can be taken off the list? Is it such that anybody who refuses to accept a proposal such as this will be penalised or will lose points within the existing local authority system for not accepting a solution to their housing need? This solution is temporary but there is no sleight of hand or misrepresentation of the facts on the existing list, which numbers almost 100,000.It is our obligation to provide for their needs in a way that amounts to a permanent solution to the unfortunate predicament in which they find themselves. For the Minister of State to stand over removing people who avail of the housing assistance payment from the housing waiting lists is, to say the least, unbelievable. I expected that, as this was raised on Committee Stage, the Minister of State and her officials would have availed of the opportunity to amend the Bill in this regard. In the absence of that, will she now accept this amendment and right what will be a wrong in the sense that the public may believe that a permanent solution has been found for up to 70,000 people when in fact nothing could be further from the truth?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	Section 37 is nothing less than a counter-revolution in the provision of social housing. It is the most retrograde and backward step imaginable in that it attempts to turn what it is a temporary necessity owing to the failure of Governments, including the previous one, to provide council housing into a permanent measure and to institutionalise the outsourcing and privatisation of social housing to the private sector. That is appalling. Everything else that the Government says or claims it proposes to do to try to address the current crisis is undermined and undone by this measure. This takes us to a place that the late Margaret Thatcher could only have dreamed of in terms of wholesale, full-scale privatisation of social housing. This section, combined with the Minister of State's earlier resistance to giving a firm commitment to reinvest all of the proceeds from tenant purchases back into the provision of social housing and the Government's cries that it does not have the money to engage in large-scale direct provision of council housing, which is necessary - and is what the Minister of State has said she would favour in an ideal world but says we cannot afford - is a recipe for full-scale privatisation of housing. The effective privatisation of the housing market by Fianna Fáil, although not set down in legal statute, is what created the ingredients for the current crisis, the property bubble and the crash that almost destroyed our economy, for which we are now paying a terrible price. Fianna Fáil did it effectively and this Government is now institutionalising what it did effectively and making it law. Accommodation owned by a private landlord and subject to a housing assistance payment arrangement with the council is not social housing. Apart from the utterly retrograde, privatising thrust of this section, it is not going to work. It indicates a failure to grasp what is currently going on. I am sure the Minister of State is in contact with the local authorities on this issue, which makes it more difficult to understand the reason she would put this in legislation. Everybody knows and is finally acknowledging that private landlords are walking away. All of the evidence suggests that even those who have not walked away could walk at any time because they can command higher rents elsewhere. How can the Minister of State possibly say that an arrangement between a private landlord and a local authority, from which arrangement a landlord can walk at any time if it is possible for him or her to make more money elsewhere, represents a permanent solution to people's housing need? It does not, yet this Bill says it does. The Bill states that the provision of social housing assistance under the relevant Part shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of social housing support. It is not. I do not know how the Minister of State can claim it is when she has acknowledged that these types of arrangement are temporary. In response to questions during the past year on the need to raise the rent caps, the Minister, Deputy Burton, rightly said, although somewhat disingenuously, that we cannot do that because we do not want to continue to pour money into the pockets of private landlords. We agree. The only way to avoid doing that is to provide social housing, but what the Minister of State is proposing to do is to institutionalise the arrangement through which we pour money into the pockets of private landlords and call that permanent social housing provision. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that this is a recipe for a return to slum landlordism. While some of the landlords engaged in RAS arrangements are good, reasonable and so on, others are not. Some of the accommodation is sub-standard and there are huge problems in terms of who is directly in charge of ensuring that accommodation is up to standard. While tenants can call in the environmental health officer or local authority in respect of housing that is unsuitable, many are afraid to do so because if they do their landlord will pull out of the RAS arrangement, leaving them homeless. The council would then have a housing obligation to those people which it could not fulfil, because it currently cannot fulfil it for anybody, even those in the most dire of circumstances. One of the justifications for the housing assistance payment is to ensure that people in receipt of rent allowance are not disincentivised from working, which is positive. Last Thursday, along with dozens of families who are either homeless, threatened with homelessness or on the housing list for up to 16 years, I slept in a sleeping bag outside Dún Loaghaire-Rathdown County Council. At 7 a.m. the following morning, approximately half of the people there left to go to work. Some of these people are homeless but they work. The homeless are the people who are working. They are not just people who are dependant on social welfare; some are on low incomes, in part-time jobs and so on.  This provision will not address the crisis. In fact, it is institutionalising the problem that produced the crisis in the first instance - namely, dependance on the private sector. All that is required is that one word be changed to acknowledge that this is a temporary measure, so that anybody who is forced into an arrangement which is temporary and is not appropriate or suitable has the comfort of knowing that while housing is currently not available, they are entitled to a council house and the authority is moving to provide them with those houses. That is what we need. This has to be changed; otherwise, the Bill cannot be supported. If it is not changed, everything else in the Bill becomes decorative and what we will actually have is a counter-revolution in social housing of which the late Margaret Thatcher would be proud.

I cannot believe what is being provided for in this Bill, particularly in this provision. My experience of the RAS in South Tipperary County Council has been good. The officials there do a very good job. What is being proposed is a trick of the loop. The Minister of State could be a magician rather than the Minister of State with responsibility for housing. The Minister of State has made a number of announcements on radio and television about additional moneys she has acquired for the construction of houses so as to make some kind of dent in the housing list. We are all aware of the seriousness of the situation. What is proposed is a real trick of the loop. If the Minister of State manages to have thousands banished form the housing list she will be a wonder woman, thereby taking that title from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. It would be unbelievable.I do not believe the Labour Party Deputies will troop in here tonight and vote for this. I come from Clonmel, a very proud town where the Labour Party originated. Someone suggested the members of the Labour Party will be coming back here in a minibus after the next election but I believe they will be coming back on a tandem bicycle. None of them will be coming back. The Labour Party had such a proud record of service, especially on housing and such issues. I do not know how Labour Ministers could introduce this kind of legislation. I do know who is in charge in the Department. Is it the towering Minister, Deputy Hogan, affectionately known as Big Phil, who is leaving these shores? The Minister of State will not have any place to go and will have to remain in Limerick.

I am just saying I cannot believe a Labour Minister of State would introduce such a trick of the loop - one could not call it anything else - just to banish 70,000 people from the housing list. During the election campaign, the party stated on a poster that it created 70,000 jobs but someone wrote “in Canada” on one of them. This Bill represents another "to hell or to Connacht" policy by the Labour Party. I am totally appalled by it and abhor it. I will certainly be voting against it and making my views known. I do not know whether the officials are pushing this or whether the Labour Party is not keeping an eye on them. I do not want to blame the officials unduly but the policy is coming from somewhere. I cannot believe it had its origins among any Labour Ministers.

I have been dealing with people in RAS tenancies for eight or nine years. They would have been on the housing list for 12 or 14 years. The Minister of State knows well that the RAS has completely collapsed in Dublin and does not really exist anymore. Nobody is opting for it and no landlord is interested in it. Tenants are very wary of it. The reason they are wary is that they have no security of tenure. Even after seven, eight or nine years in a district, and with children going to a particular school and with family arrangements being made on the basis of a long-term tenancy, people still expect to be allocated a local authority home, be it in the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council or, in my case, Fingal County Council. That is what tenants are aiming for. It would be very retrograde step if, at the wave of a wand, the 78,000 people passing from rent supplement to HAP were now deemed to be housed. Our experience as representatives is directly the opposite because of the insecurity and uncertainty that arise. As I stated earlier, children and parents both endure unacceptable stress and tension. On Committee Stage, colleagues raised this matter extensively. I urge the Minister of State to simply accept the amendment and proceed on that basis. We are still thinking of the raft of reports we have had. We should have been doing what I suggest three to six years ago in regard to social housing. People are still thinking about a way forward to allow us to meet the urgent needs of the 90,000 families on the social housing list. However, this sleight of hand, as a colleague called it, is not a solution.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	I very strongly support this amendment. It is really beyond belief that the Minister of State would seek to make this legislative provision. It is extraordinary that she would seek to absolve the State of responsibility for providing public housing. It brings to mind what the Government is doing in the health area, where the thrust of policy is now to privatise our public health service and for the State to wash its hands of responsibility for the provision of public health services. In effect, this is what the provision in the Bill is doing. It is allowing the Government to walk away and say the provision of a public housing programme is no longer the responsibility of the State. I was not aware that the Labour Party, in particular, favoured small government and the wholesale privatisation of public services, but it seems that is actually what is happening here. As other speakers have said, and as we were constantly reminded by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the current Minister responsible for housing, rent supplement was a temporary measure that was never intended as a substitute for a proper public housing programme. For the Minister to walk away from that responsibility and hand it over to the private sector is shocking. I agree with others who have said that, on the basis of this provision alone, this Bill deserves to be voted down. I do not know why the Minister has not taken the time to rethink this after the strong arguments that were made on Committee Stage. It is really regrettable that, by all indications, there is no budge all. The Minister has not taken on board the points that were made very strongly by the several members at meetings of the committee. It would be entirely different if we had a tightly regulated housing market here, with the State taking responsibility for the public good, as in the provision of an adequate number of houses, and regulating the market. Such a model operates in some parts of Europe. In those regions, large numbers of people live their entire lives in rented accommodation but do so in a market that is very tightly regulated by their state. They have security of tenure and are free to live for 30, 40 or 50 years in accommodation with security underpinned by law. Moreover, there are strict rent controls. However, we do not have such conditions in Ireland. Rather, we have a very lightly regulated housing market. For that reason, it makes it all the more shocking that the Government is seeking to hand over responsibility for what should be a key public service to the private sector. The state of so much of the private rental accommodation is absolutely appalling. It is disgraceful that the State is paying money into the pockets of landlords who keep their accommodation in such disgraceful conditions. The State has a hands-off approach to this. While we know there are standards set down in theory, we know there is little or no adherence to those standards in practice. For example, there is but one environmental health officer responsible for ensuring standards are met on the north side of Dublin. If tenants are prepared to take the risk of reporting unsuitable accommodation - very few are because it is so extraordinarily difficult to come across a landlord who is prepared to make accommodation available to somebody on rent supplement - they must wait weeks or, in some cases, months for any kind of response from the local authority, again because of the lack of prioritisation in this area, the arm's-length approach to ensuring the maintenance of proper standards by the Government, and the restriction of funding for the environmental health service. I am shocked that the Minister of State is proposing to walk away from responsibilities. One of the key responsibilities of any socially minded, concerned Government is to ensure the existence of adequate public services, particularly in the area of housing, which is so central to all our lives.It is a disgrace that the Government would seek to do this. I would appeal to the Minister of State very strongly to pull back from this, not to be led by the nose by her Fine Gael colleagues in this regard, to stand up to them and to reject this.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	451	Section 37 goes to the heart of this. It was said by Deputy Cowen that this needs to be revised because it is a mistake. The problem is it is not a mistake. The Minister of State is here doing the bidding of Fine Gael and it is leaving her here. It is not a mistake. It is a very deliberate political action that is going to fundamentally change the landscape of social housing now and into the future. It is appalling because what the Government is doing is abandoning people on housing waiting lists to the markets. It is abandoning them to their own devices to find accommodation, to plead with landlords and for those landlords to then engage with the local authorities. If people would not do this for the higher amounts that were allowed under RAS, for the life of me, I cannot figure out what landlords are going to suddenly appear who will present themselves to the local authorities around the country and offer themselves for hundreds of euro less a month than they can get in market rents, particularly in the large urban areas. We are going to leave people very vulnerable. I handed the Taoiseach a list yesterday of a dozen people in my area as case studies of the kind of issues people face every day. One woman has a new baby and she was actually out looking for accommodation while she was in labour. She still has not been housed and she cannot register her baby because she is of no fixed abode. She is just a normal person, trying to live. She has been renting for several years and has been on the housing list for six or seven years. Every one of these people suffers because the rents in the area are hundreds of euro above the rent caps. Yet, these people are being told to go and find accommodation that simply is not there. When this section is read side-by-side with what is intended in regard to the amount of money that is going to be provided, it is clear people are going to have to scrap for substandard accommodation because there simply will not be anything available, certainly in the short term. This is not just a policy about people finding temporary accommodation. This is about the social conditions under which children in this country are going to be reared into the future, when there will be no certainty. We will not even be able to plan school accommodation because people will have to keep on moving as the landlords decide they want their houses back, for whatever reason. This is a social disaster that the Minister of State is proposing and I do not believe it is an accident. I said yesterday that housing authorities will now become housing support agencies but that would be in a very minimalist way. The person will have to go and find the accommodation themselves. It will no longer be a situation where somebody on a housing waiting list will ever aspire to having a home. They may well get temporary rented accommodation but it will not be a home. That has profound consequences. I believe this is a seminal moment. This is a day we will look back to and say it was the day the mistake was made, and this Minister of State will be the one who is referred to. She must go back and revisit this. It is absolutely unacceptable. One of the bright things that happened in the last year and a half was when President Michael D. Higgins went to the European Parliament and set out a vision for the kind of social Europe we should have. We are included in that Europe. It was a day when we should all have been very proud. He referred widely to Jürgen Habermas, the German philosopher who had talked about how the German Government was insisting that the priority was about stabilising budgets but doing so at individual state level, where it was going to be at the expense of social security systems, public services and collective goods. That is exactly what has been happening. It is so much Frankfurt's way, and this is so much about the markets and a market-driven response to something that has serious social consequences. If the Minister of State subscribes to the principles the Labour Party was set up under, she cannot allow this situation to arise where people, including very vulnerable people, are being effectively abandoned to the markets.

I did not say it was a mistake. I said it must be a mistake because I could not understand, as I and others have alluded to, that no reference or message has been received by the Labour Party from the electorate in regard to the recent election result. One of its core social requirements in the provision of housing is to be abandoned with the proposals contained in this legislation. In this amendment, where we are asking for one word to be changed, that one word means a lot. Obviously, it does not mean much to the proposers of the legislation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	453	I am absolutely appalled there is nobody from the media here. This is an incredibly important social issue and I hope it does not go unreported this evening. I am also appalled there is nobody here from Labour or Fine Gael to even stand over such a policy. Has the Labour Party learned nothing from the electoral hiding it got two weeks ago? It will go into extinction if it tries to carry through this sort of a policy. Housing emerged as one of the biggest issues on the doorsteps, as all of the Deputies here will know. I have sat here all day, following this Bill and intervening in the debate. What we have in front of us is a housing Bill with no houses. Now, the latest thing the Government has put in front of us is that it is going to massage the waiting lists out of existence and massage the figures. As it did with JobBridge and with the unemployment figures, it is now going to put people into a category which suggests they are adequately housed. I would correct one thing. It is not a counterrevolution; it is just a continuation of what I have seen on the councils for the past 11 years, where housing has been slowly but surely privatised. Dublin City Council built 29 houses last year. This is not new; rather, it is a continuation. Fianna Fáil started it and, now, Fine Gael and Labour are continuing it. Fingal County Council, in my own area, is going to build 25 houses this year when we have up to 10,000 on the housing list. The only thing that comforts me is that it is not going to work. Where is the Minister of State going to find these private landlords who want to take families? Has she not copped on to the problem that has been going on here for the last few years? There is a rent bubble out there and there is no way that landlords want to take in families when they can get money in the private sector at a much higher rate. How dare the Government say to the taxpayers that it will shovel all of their money into housing people at inordinate cost with private landlords who have been getting some €400 million from this scheme every year, and it used to be €500 million until the Government implemented its cuts. How dare it continue that policy. The average rent in Dublin 15, as elsewhere, is approximately €1,300 for a family-type house, and €1,400 for anything bigger. The Government would be putting €1,000 a month into housing families in such situations, money it could be using to build homes and then get rent back.How anyone could say this makes economic sense is beyond me. The only thing that makes sense is that it constitutes further capitulation to landlords who have close connections with Fine Gael and now it seems the Labour Party. The Minister for Social Protection today announced rent payments would be increased on a case by case basis; therefore, people will still have to go begging to their local community welfare officer without rent controls being introduced at the same time. The Government seems to be happy to keep shovelling money in the direction of private landlords that could be used to build homes. I have seen it all. Nobody from the Labour Party will be sitting on the other side after the next general election. The difference between now and previous times when the Labour Party could exit the coalition for a while, lick its wounds and then slither back in is that there is now competition from others on the left. It appears to have learned nothing from the message delivered by the electorate.

I would not use such language if I was her. Let me read the amendment because there has been a total over-reaction to what the legislation contains. What Deputies Barry Cowen, Seán Ó Fearghaíl and Dessie Ellis are seeking to do is change the wording as follows. Section 35 states "the provision of housing assistance under this Part shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of social housing support for a household that is determined by a housing authority under the said section 20 to be qualified for such support". What the Deputies are seeking to do is to say it would not be an appropriate form of social housing support. I am not saying this is a permanent solution to people's housing issues, but let us not put in the legislation something that is not in it. I am not saying that under the Bill we will suddenly build a pile of houses because we are not going to do so. There is an issue with supply, as I have acknowledged, and I have spoken in various debates about how we might address it. The Bill is not the answer to all housing issues.  The cases described by many Deputies arise under the current rent supplement scheme. They involve people who are at risk of being kicked out of their houses because of the current rent supplement scheme which has developed, as many Deputies rightly said, into a so-called long-term solution to their problems. There will still be under the Department of Social Protection a short-term rent supplement scheme which is what it should be about for those who find themselves urgently in need of housing. What the Bill is attempting to do is to give some security to those in so-called short-term rent supplement schemes and allow them, for example, to go back to work. We had a reasonable discussion on the purpose of the legislation on Second Stage, but it is not meant to provide the only long-term solution to anybody's housing problems. In fact, the word "permanent" is not used anywhere in the legislation.  Of course, we have issues of supply and there are financial constraints which were also faced by the previous Government in the last couple of years of its life, regardless of who was at fault, but we will move away from them as quickly as we can and we will do so by trying to fix the economy. We cannot pay for social housing to the extent that it is required from current capital budgets. As that is the reality, we must find ways of addressing the issue of supply.  Deputy Ruth Coppinger talked about the Labour Party's way, but if she looks at other countries, including the Nordic countries which have had social democratic governments and systems in place for years, she will see that they have operated systems which involve a mix, with some housing being directly funded by the state through local authorities, some provided through a very large voluntary housing sector and some by private owners. I take the point that we need much greater security of tenure for people who find themselves in that position and we need to learn from neighbouring countries in that regard. That is why we are amending the Residential Tenancies Act and I am willing to look at the issue of rent controls and have asked the Housing Agency to carry out a short review which will be ready for us in about one month. I am not saying we do not need to regulate the private sector. Of course, we need to regulate it. I am certainly not happy with the fact that more and more money has been poured into the pockets of private landlords without proper controls. At least with this Bill the local authorities will have some control over what happens. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett spoke about slum landlordism, while Deputy Róisín Shortall spoke about the bad conditions in which people were living. That is why we are dealing with the issue of regulation and amending the Residential Tenancies Act. I heard people say recently on "Liveline" with Joe Duffy that we should row back on standards and allow for bedsits that did not have sanitary facilities. I am not giving into this. I am not giving into the landlord class that is suggesting I should do so.

This will enable the State to provide a more integrated and streamlined service for households seeking support to meet their housing needs. I have said they will be eligible for transfer to a local authority house.

She says the proposed amendment and the subsequent explanation given by me and others misrepresent the facts as she understands them. She has seen fit to quote section 35 in respect of the proposal to insert the word "not" in place of the word "shall". Section 35 states:Subject to regulations made for the purposes of subsection (4)(f) of section 20 of the Act of 2009, the provision of housing assistance under this Part shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of social housing support for a household that is determined by a housing authority under the said section 20 to be qualified for such support.A housing support is the same as a housing need or a housing requirement. Those on a local authority housing list have a housing need. Along with the Minister of State, we have a responsibility in so far as we can to offer appropriate funding and supports to local authorities to meet the requirements of those on the lists. As we all know from regular interaction with our constituents, this is one of the greatest needs and demands of society, in addition to the problems people face on foot of Government decisions regarding a property tax and water charges and the costs associated with same, which are far in excess of what the supposed average was to be-----

The only intention is that the housing requirements will be adhered to by virtue of this scheme, which is to be commended, but it is not a permanent solution. One cannot solve a permanent problem with a temporary solution and, therefore, the public should be well aware that those who remain with a housing need will continue to have a permanent requirement and the Minister of State has been charged with the responsibility to offer solutions in this regard. Unfortunately, this provision does not provide a solution. I remain committed to the amendment and ask Members to support it.

She may believe the word "appropriate" is enough but this will come down to the interpretation of local authority managers and not hers. Managers will see this as a giving them a green light to say this is appropriate accommodation and once that happens, applicants will be removed from the housing waiting lists. Lo and behold, the numbers will be massaged and the almost 90,000 on the lists currently will suddenly reduce to so many thousand. The same happened with RAS. Local authority managers interpreted the implementation of the scheme their own way. I recall this argument. When people went on to the RAS, they were told they would be given another RAS property at the end of their lease and they would never be evicted. They were told they would be given local authority housing if none was available but now they are homeless. From 2011 onwards, RAS recipients were removed from the housing list. The issue is not the Minister of State's interpretation but that of managers in housing departments. They will determine where people will end up and that is the problem.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	Despite the Minister of State's assurances, this is a counter revolution. I made the point strongly that the effective privatisation of housing started under Fianna Fáil, as she acknowledged, but that the change wrought by this provision is that what was held to be a temporary measure will become a permanent measure. If Members listen carefully to what the Minister of State said, it will not just be down to the interpretation of county managers. She let the cat out of the bag because she said this will be deemed to be social housing and then people can apply for a transfer - that is, once a client is in one of these arrangements, he or she is off the housing waiting list. I am certain that is what she just said. One can apply for a transfer but one will be off the list and that is the counter revolution because that means privatised, outsourced social housing to landlords and the market will be deemed to be the same as being in a council house. However, it is not. This legislation suggests that it is and it is the legal underpinning for the wholesale outsourcing and privatisation of social housing because privatised social housing will be deemed to be the same as a council house. The counter revolution is in that sleight of hand. There is further reason to believe this will be the case. When RAS was set up, applicants were told they would be on the scheme for four years and at the end of that time, they would get a council house. Then a directive issued as a result of a policy document produced by the Government in 2012, which said if one was on the RAS, one was deemed to be housed. There was murder. The clients were put on a fixed transfer list but everybody will be taken off the list at the end of four years. That is what this does. The reason I did not table an amendment to the section is I was sleeping outside the council offices, which we all end up having to do, if we do not do something about this on Thursday and Friday. If what we are alleging is not true, the Minister of State should insert the word "temporary" in the Seanad and give us an assurance that this provision will be temporary and that people who take up the HAP arrangement will not be taken off the waiting lists. If she does that, our concern will be addressed.

Most of us interpret this as providing that once people are in receipt of HAP, their need for housing will be deemed to have been met and, therefore, they will come off the housing list. Is that the case? The key issue is whether a person retains an entitlement to local authority housing. Does he or she come off the list once he or she in receipt of HAP? If so, this is a major departure from what we all understand to be social housing and the State's responsibility to those who are not in a position to provide housing for themselves.

Will people remain on the housing waiting lists if they are in receipt of HAP? That is a clear and simple question to answer. If so, we would not raise this issue. As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the council interpreted RAS as meaning recipients were adequately housed and they were removed from the housing waiting lists. Now we are witnessing all the problems that has created. I cannot understand why this is being put forward because no private housing is available. RAS is defunct and, as previous speakers said, landlords do not want to participate, which has led to people becoming homeless. I know council tenants who are paying under the table to remain in RAS. The entire system is corrupt. If the Minister of State clarifies this, we will all be happy.

Amendments Nos. 20 and 21, 23 to 26, inclusive, and 29 to 32, inclusive, form a composite proposal and may be discussed together.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	512	I move amendment No. 20: In page 49, to delete lines 32 and 33 and substitute the following:“(a) the housing authority concerned shall source dwellings in respect of which they will seek to place people under the housing assistance scheme,”.I am aware that we have issues over HAP and we have just had arguments on the previous grouping. However, I do not understand why, with the introduction of HAP, we did not go the full hog and give local authorities the ability to source accommodation for tenants or would-be tenants. Over the past while, I have seen people travelling around, some of them with children and some of them pregnant, seeking places to rent. Some of these people are living in cars while they try to source a place. That is the situation. The gist of most of these amendments is that the local authorities should take a lead role in sourcing accommodation. They should use the resources available to them to do this. They have the computers, skills and means to do it. Many of the people we are talking about do not have these means, but they are being forced to travel all over the city looking for accommodation. I believe local authorities are better placed to source landlords and maintain a list of accommodation that might be available over a period. The local authorities are best placed to build up this intelligence in terms of landlords and properties. People should not be forced to source it themselves. Local authorities deal with the situation of the homeless in general. Up to recently, we had in the order of 200 people a day in hotels sourced by the local authority, but even officials in the homeless sections of the local authorities are having problems sourcing these places. We can imagine the cost of this. If 200 families require accommodation on a given night at a cost of approximately €80 per room, this means €16,000 a day is being spent on this accommodation. This is a problem. Trying to find this accommodation is a major issue and that is the problem these amendments try to resolve.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	513	The decision to push through the section we have just dealt with will cause blue murder. When word filters out that people who have been on lists for ten or 12 years are no longer on a list, there will be uproar. That said, the Government seems hell bent on moving in this direction. Perhaps, if word gets out, there is some chance it will reconsider this before the Bill goes to the Seanad. Otherwise, the anger that will be directed at the Government for what has just been done will be extraordinary. If the Government is hell bent on this path, the least it can do is prove its proposals can work. To be honest, if it was to ring local government officials tomorrow, they would tell it the proposals will not work. However, it could try to prove they could work by requiring local authorities and their officials, when they decide people must find private rental accommodation at the level of HAP set, to go and source the accommodation themselves. If the local authorities went to source it, they would find that it would cost hundreds of euro more than the current rent caps, that is if any accommodation could be found. In most cases, accommodation will not be available. No matter how sophisticated, well trained and well intentioned and resourced housing departments are, they will not be able to find accommodation. This is the challenge for the Minister of State. I suggest the Minister of State should contact her local authority in Limerick to find out what is going on. I can tell her that my clinic is like an extension of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's housing department. Such is the level of interaction between us that the director of housing asked me the other day whether we were taking over his department. This is the level of interaction on crisis situations at this time. This all comes down to the fact that accommodation cannot be found. It is not available. However, people in desperate situations, with families and illness and so on, are told to go and find private rental accommodation for the HAP.  I could cite a litany of examples, but will only cite the latest. A man came to me yesterday having just got out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, after having two heart attacks. He can barely talk or walk and is in a situation where he needs support. What family he has is too old and disabled itself to provide him with accommodation or the support he needs. He has been told to go and find private rented accommodation to fit the caps. This is not a joke. This situation is too serious to joke about. It is obscene and absurd that this man, in the state of health he is in, would be asked to go and find rented accommodation at the caps or for the HAP. Fantasy is not the word for what is happening. This proposal is a disaster waiting to happen. The proposal put forward by Deputy Ellis is a minimal measure. At least it would ensure we test the water by requiring officials to go out and find this accommodation. They will not find it, but at least if they try to find it, there will be no dispute about the situation. As things stand, there is dispute. People are told to go out and find accommodation, but when they come back having been unable to find it, they are told they have not tried hard enough and should go out and try harder. If the Minister of State and the Government believe this is workable - I tell them it is not - they should agree to this amendment so that the State will be required to do what it is asking tenants to do. If it did that, then it would find out how utterly unworkable this is. Then at least we could sit down together with the people on the housing list and come up with a plan that actually works.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	514	Deputy Ellis spoke earlier about hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people and the costs of same. That is an approach that some local authorities take. However, others do not take that approach to homelessness but leave it up to people to find accommodation themselves, to find a couch somewhere or, in some cases, to sleep in a car. They might not say "Sleep in your car," but that is the only option available to some people. I have certainly come across people who have been sleeping in cars. I spoke to a woman who was sleeping in her car who told me that she could see no way out. She was very depressed about it, understandably. She was concerned about where to park in order to be safe, she had nowhere to wash or get fresh clothes and nowhere to charge her phone. That has been the experience of some people; they have not been in a hotel. I do not dispute the very valid point that Deputy Ellis made about the stupidity of the costs associated with accommodating people in hotels, but this is Ireland in 2014. A number of county managers, from Roscommon, Dún Laoghaire and Limerick, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht recently. Each of them said that they always had to go above the rent caps to get RAS houses. They would not get such houses otherwise. Roscommon is not the worst case, as it is one of the local authority areas that is under the least pressure, but that was the uniform experience. With the RAS the criterion is 92% of the market rent, but what we are looking at here is hundreds of euro per month below that in most cases.  Often we are asking very vulnerable people to go looking for accommodation. I referred earlier to a woman who had just had a baby - how was she supposed to find accommodation? As I said before, women are not allowed out of hospital with their babies if they do not have a child seat in their car, yet they might have no home to go to. It is extraordinary. Some of the local authorities have actually become homeless agencies, because that is their main function. All day long they are dealing with people who are turning up in crisis.  I ask that a member of the Government or someone in the Department go out and look at a typical unit to let in Dublin city or county or in the counties surrounding it and speak to the people who turn up. Such people are taking the letting agents to one side and begging them to accept rent assistance payments. They are not just asking, but are begging and are promising to top them up. That is the experience, and if the Minister of State rings auctioneers they will tell her that. The houses are simply not available within the current limits. Essentially, we are asking people to go out and find such houses to give the impression that something is being done. Deputy Ellis was absolutely correct when he said that if housing officials were sent out to try to source accommodation, the Minister of State would soon get the true story back in a very direct way. That story is not being transmitted to her at the moment.  This is the number one issue for me and takes up almost all of the time in my constituency office. I can completely relate to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said in that regard. It is a human tragedy. This amendment, at least, seeks to place the obligation to find accommodation on the local authorities rather than on the individuals.

This is the biggest issue taking up my time as a public representative and it is sapping the energy of all of us. The heartbreak that we are dealing with on a daily basis is appalling. Some of our staff need counselling and cannot do this job for a long period of time, and I would say that is an issue across the board.

We might as well make life somewhat easier for them. There should be one place for them to go, and if they are to be shoved into private accommodation, the council should have the responsibility of at least sourcing it for them. I will give one example to illustrate why I think this is necessary. Deputies may remember the case of the Connell family, whose picture my party shared on Facebook. They were made homeless because of a rent increase of 42%, and the family was separated, with members living in three or four different locations. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, who represents the area, claimed that there were properties available in Dublin 15 and argued that the family just had to look a little bit harder. That was such an insult to that family, who were spending all day, every day looking for accommodation over a three- or four-month period. Following a meeting with the Minister, the family was given the number of a landlord in the Dublin West area who did accept rent allowance, but the family had been in contact with him already and he had no properties available to rent. Nothing was produced by the Minister or her staff. The family got accommodation in the end by going public in a campaigning way. Another family took pity on them and leased an apartment to them, which is overcrowded, but better than nothing. If the Minister for Social Protection could not find private accommodation within the rent allowance limit, how the hell can we expect anybody else to be able to do it? It is time we declared a housing emergency. If people could see the attendance at this debate tonight, they would be horrified at the lack of interest. They would also be horrified at what is being put on the table. People are now being told that they will get housing assistance payments but they will no longer be on any list for permanent accommodation. I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's earlier point about telling that to the dozens of people with whom we deal on a weekly basis. Perhaps this is the straw that we need to break the camel's back and get people mobilised, through a national demonstration or something of that ilk.

The housing lists were building up even during the Celtic tiger era.

That is why we introduced the preventative measure which I mentioned a number of times in this House and which was made public over the airwaves last night and today.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	522	-----with the assistance of Threshold. It is a response to what has been described to us as an urgent issue. People were losing their homes because rents were being increased and they were no longer meeting the cap requirements. The measure is being put in place to deal with that issue. In terms of the specific amendments, under the rent supplement scheme people source their own accommodation, and the intention is that this would continue under the HAP system. However, that does not stop local authorities from assisting. I know that in some cases the homeless officers, in particular, have phone numbers of landlords and information on accommodation possibilities.Organisations in the voluntary sector - Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, etc. - also help people to source accommodation. There is a proposal in respect of the Dublin area that a group of those organisations will come together with the specific aim of sourcing accommodation in the private rented sector. There is already a similar scheme in place in Cork. I am not opposed to the provision of assistance. If we included in the legislation an obligation for local authorities to source accommodation, that would allow local authority officials to discover how difficult it is to do so, but I do not believe it would speed up the process. I am of the view that it would actually slow matters down when people are seeking to access accommodation under the HAP process. It is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure that the housing chosen by recipients under the scheme meets the relevant accommodation standard and that the landlords of these properties are tax-compliant. I do not know if it will prove to be of any assistance in the context of the debate that previously took place, but I wish to point out that if a household has qualified for social housing support but cannot source appropriate accommodation in the private rented sector under HAP, the relevant housing authority - within current supply constraints - retains a general level of responsibility in terms of providing an appropriate form of housing support for the household. On one hand, Deputy Ellis is stating that he is concerned about access to local authority housing for people in receipt of the HAP, while on the other he is stating that it is going to be impossible to source accommodation for those in receipt of the payment. I assure him that where it is not possible to source accommodation, local authorities retain a general level of responsibility to provide people with an appropriate form of social housing. This will ensure that people's rights will be upheld. I am not minimising the problems that exist and I am aware of their serious nature. The entire purpose of the HAP is not to make matters worse but rather to facilitate people in getting out of poverty traps, etc. The alternative is to retain the system that is already in place, with people receiving rent supplement for years. It must be remembered that rent supplement was designed as a short-term measure and that people lose it if they obtain employment. We are trying to reform the system but I accept that there are huge supply issues. I also accept that there is need for reform in other areas, particularly with regard to the rights of tenants in the private rented sector. We are working on a number of things in this regard. Describing the problem will not solve it. We must try to find various measures that will address the problem.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	523	If local authorities were given responsibility for sourcing properties, we would really see the scale of the emergency we face. There is absolutely no doubt that many people are topping up their payments and have been doing so for some time. Increasing rent supplement without putting rent controls in place will not change that. There is still going to be a creeping effect in respect of rents. As a result, we need some form of rent control. Local authorities must be encouraged to take on a bigger role in sourcing accommodation. There is no point in their merely advising people to go here or there in search of it. If local authorities were given this responsibility, the truth about what has been happening would emerge and it would become apparent that this emergency is of a scale never before seen. The scale of what has been taking place is the very reason people are struggling to obtain rent supplement and why landlords are saying - and this type of behaviour should be outlawed - that they will not accept it. Will they now state that they will not accept the HAP? Landlords must be informed that they cannot discriminate against residents who are in receipt of rent supplement or HAP. Up to now they have been refusing to accept rent supplement. I am of the view that we are heading into troubled waters. People have been trying to source accommodation for themselves and they have become frustrated. I know no one wants to say it but there are those who have killed themselves as a result of the pressure they have been under.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	524	The fact that local authorities have an obligation does not solve anything. They have an obligation but they do not have the houses or the resources necessary to meet people's needs. As a result, they are informing individuals that they have nothing for them. I must stress that local authority officials, and not just public representatives, are overrun in respect of this matter. My heart goes out to housing department officials who are absolutely overrun and do not know where to turn. The Minister of State said it was not sufficient merely to describe the problem. That is true, but we have to begin by actually trying to define it. The difficulty is that the scheme she is establishing to solve the problem will not work because the private sector will not provide for the people we are discussing. Karl Deeter is a landlord who represents other landlords and he has publicly stated that they are not going to accept what is involved here. The Government is living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes landlords are going to do what is required. There is a sector of Irish society whose members, historically, were provided with council housing. Approximately 20% to 30% of the houses built in any one year in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s were built by the State. The figure in this regard has fallen to 1% or 2%, and that is the problem. If we do not fill the gap, there will be an emergency. That is the point at which we find ourselves. We must provide council houses rather than outsource the problem to the private sector because - apart from the enormous amount of money involved - that is just not going to work. If the Minister of State is seeking an answer on a short-term basis, I will outline one that could be adopted in my area and, I am sure, in most others. What should be done is that all available buildings in a particular area should be identified. In my area, there is a gigantic seven-block development at Merrion Gates in Sandymount which was built by Bernard McNamara and which is currently in NAMA. Half of the accommodation in this development is empty, and because it is in public ownership, it should be used to house people on a temporary basis. There is another big Celtic tiger development, The Grange on the Stillorgan Road, which people were enticed to consider as a place to live by the phrase "Welcome to the spirit of gracious living". The empty properties in that development should also be taken over by the State. There are empty council-owned buildings in my area which need to be refurbished and in which 40 to 50 families could be accommodated on a temporary basis. This could be done throughout the country. The Minister of State needs to sit down with everyone who has a stake in this matter and ask where can people be accommodated and what resources will be needed in order to ensure that this will happen.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	525	The Minister of State said that she does not minimise the problem. I wonder whether the Government is minimising it. All we can do is try to describe what we see every day of the week. We are here as representatives of our areas and this matter is dominating our work. I am not sure the Government acknowledges the extent of the problem. The lack of supply of accommodation is bad for the economy. I accept that one of the positive aspects of the legislation is that the HAP, like the RAS, will in theory provide for people to return to work. However, the Bill deals with many other matters as well. I am of the view that the lack of supply to which I refer is going to damage the economy. People who are at work, like those who are unemployed, are not able to afford accommodation. This will begin life as the HAP legislation but it will very quickly become the HAP-less legislation. Landlords are not going to queue up to accept from those in receipt of the HAP hundreds of euro per month less than they could get from others. A reality check is required. The Minister of State said we were describing the problem but she has certainly not presented any solutions. This is not just a problem; it is a crisis. Kildare was excluded from the initiative - albeit a very short-term one - that was taken and to which the Minister of State referred. Anything that can relieve the pressure that exists is welcome, but let us not over-hype initiatives of this nature as being more than they are. The initiative in question does not even extend to the areas that are affected. The situation in Cork city is every bit as bad, if not worse, than that which obtains in Dublin. The situation in Kildare is certainly as bad as in any of the Dublin local authority areas. However, Kildare has been left out of the equation. That is just not good enough. The money that was made available in the mid-Leinster region for the homeless was exhausted by March. There might be a general obligation on local authorities but this has not been backed up with the resources necessary to provide alternative accommodation, even on a temporary basis.

I feel sorry for the Minister of State and I empathise with her entirely because she has inherited an impossible situation. I am not making a political point - it is simply a fact of life - but this problem had its origins approximately 12 years ago when a decision was taken not to replace the housing stock at local authority level and to do everything possible to shift from the local authority for reasons that I cannot understand. The private sector and Part V regulations and so on were supposed to resolve the housing problem, but they did not work. In fact, it failed miserably. Prior to that in Kildare, for example, approximately 300 houses per annum were being built and a further 400 local authority loans were offered to people who were in the income bracket between qualifying for a local authority house and the next level up. This amounted to effectively 1,000 houses per annum in the county. There are 8,500 people on the local authority housing list at the moment and it is rising all the time. I read a commentary that included a suggestion from some economist that people would not go back to work because they would lose rent supplement. The reality is that the rent supplement is no good to people either at work or out of work. It makes no difference because the supplement is in lieu of local authority housing. Local authority housing was the bedrock on which a large sector of our population had depended in the past. Such people could aspire to owning an affordable house. Then affordable housing went out the window and everything went over to the investment sector. Unfortunately, that sector now controls the entire market. Deputy Ellis and others spoke earlier while I was in the Chair and I could not comment at that stage. However, the fact is that this is correct. It is not the problem of the Minister of State. She did not create the problem, she inherited it. Whether there is a will to resolve it will remain to be seen but I believe the Minister of State has the will to resolve the problem and she understands it. It is at least three years since I visited the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government first, along with others, to focus on this particular issue. The point about housing is that we should plan at least six or seven years ahead and if we do not, then we have the kind of crisis that we have now. I see the measures taken already as being helpful but they are only stopgap measures and will not resolve the problem. We need a major focus on a local authority or public sector house-building programme, a restoration of the local authority loans fund that was available previously to people to house themselves and the provision of local authority sites, as in the past. All these combined are likely to have a far more serious impact on the issue than anything that has been done so far. Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a particular point on the economy. Up to 20,000 jobs per annum can accrue from a reinvigorated local authority house-building programme. The question is how to do it. How can this be done without upsetting the Government's balance sheet and keeping in line with what has been done to date? We cannot simply walk into the NAMA houses and declare that we own them and that we are going to take them back. That is like a shopkeeper going through his own till and deciding to pay himself out of it. It does not work that way. We need to find a means or formula to get past that and we should do so soon.

However, we have the difficulty of the Government balance sheet and that obstacle is being examined. Reference was made to the general supply issue. The Government's construction strategy is designed to increase both public and private supply and I understand there are over 70 action points in that, some 30 of which are within my area of housing and planning. That is the issue of supply. Reference was made to a prevention strategy, in particular the strategy being rolled out in the Dublin area. I am keen to see that extended to the rest of the country and I hope we can do that as quickly as possible. However, that will involve the co-operation of the local authorities, the Department of Social Protection and voluntary organisations such as Threshold. We need such voluntary involvement to provide the telephone lines, interact with tenants and ensure that people know the measures available and can be assured that they do not have to leave if a landlord tells them they should leave. Deputy Ellis and others made the point that perhaps local authorities were unaware and that the amendment would make local authorities more aware of how difficult it is to source accommodation at the caps. The housing assistance payment will do precisely that because the local authority will be paying the money to the landlord. The tenant portion will be collected and the local authority will transfer that in addition to the State portion to the landlord in regular payments. Therefore, they will know and will be aware if properties are unaffordable and if top-ups are what is keeping them going. That awareness will come. I have made the argument previously that the security of payment may well mean that some landlords will see it as attractive, although they may be getting less money, because under the other scheme they were reliant on the tenant passing on the rent supplement. Many have said they were not getting their money. At least under this scheme there will be security for landlords in that sense. While I admit that they are probably getting less money, at least they will have the security of knowing that they will get it.

There are solutions to everything but we have put forward proposals with regard to solutions. I realise they would take some time but they could work if they were enacted quickly, worked on and if the Cabinet would agree it. We know from all the parliamentary questions we have put that there is at least €1 billion in the strategic fund that could be used. That would deliver almost 8,000 units. This would have all the pluses in terms of getting people back to work, local authorities getting rent from the properties and taking many people off the rent supplement and rental accommodation schemes etc. These are all pluses. Let us consider the mathematics. It is not as though we will add to our national debt in any way or that we will have to argue with the troika over it. There is money available but we need to see the will to do it. This needs to be taken to Cabinet. It needs to be put to those in Cabinet that this is an absolute crisis. There are 5,000 people homeless and 40 new families per month are reporting homelessness. People are in mortgage distress and tens of thousands of people are in danger of being made homeless. We are going to see more people losing out as a result of the introduction of the housing assistance payment because landlords are not accepting rent supplement, they are not going to accept the housing assistance payment or be tied in to a local authority. That will be the next step from them. We need to take action quickly. There are solutions to this.

I speak as someone who was born and bred in Tuam, County Galway. As a young child I remember these children in my class but I also remember the terrible way they were treated, especially by the broader society, and the blatant discrimination that went on at the time. There can be no running away from this issue. These were terrible times, and everybody has a responsibility to deal with this issue, particularly those in leadership and authority roles. The oppression of women, the high mortality rates in these mother and baby homes, the vaccine trials, and the secret and illegal adoptions were all part of our dark history, and we need to deal with the facts. We need the truth but, above all, we need to ensure that this never happens again in our country. Thirty-five thousand women spent time in these homes. Seven hundred and ninety six babies died in the Tuam home, and the remains of 3,200 children are in the Castlepollard home. There was also the Bethany Home. Three thousand children in these institutions had to endure vaccine trials. We need the truth and the facts. We need a proper inquiry, and in that regard I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister. I want to highlight what is happening in Ireland in 2014. The hypocrisy being engaged in, particularly by some politicians, gets up my nose, particularly when 375,000 children are experiencing deprivation in our country today. We have 1,791 children seeking asylum housed in 30 direct provision centres, some of whom have been in those centres for more than seven years. In 2012, the special rapporteur highlighted the real risk of those children suffering abuse. Almost 3,000 children and adolescents are on waiting lists for mental health services. Eighty two per cent of carers are being affected by the cuts in care packages, and 77% of families have been affected by the cuts in respite care. If the Government really cares about these issues and these children, it must also do something about what is happening to children today.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	534	I agree with Susan Lohan of the Adoption Rights Alliance who said we should have examined these issues years ago but instead, a collective head in the sand attitude was taken. It often takes a major event for us to realise that something has to be done. As somebody else said, this was hidden in plain view. This inquiry has to put an end to the issue, and it must be comprehensive. We are debating the Private Members' motion but the announcement has been made by the Minister. Last week I asked for the Tuam location to be declared a crime scene because there was something very unusual about the burial location. That is the reason it got so much attention around the world. An inquiry must not exclude the Garda, the State pathologist and forensic anthropologists. That must happen. When I met the Minister yesterday I raised with him the need to include foster care and boarding out as issues that need to be addressed in addition to adoption and the drug trials. There must be an understanding of the social conditions at the time that led to what happened.  We are all affected by the people who are contacting us to tell us their stories. They want to tell their stories, and when we hear over the coming months about the impact this has had on their lives we will have a fuller understanding of the long-term consequences of the way we treated people in this country. There are contemporary comparisons, and it would be wrong of us not to point to them. One of these is direct provision.Children raised for extensive periods in these environments can be badly damaged. We have a responsibility to do something about this also.

These homes were registered, regulated and inspected by the State under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934. They were State services. They were registered, regulated and inspected officially by the State and run by religious orders. During this time the State was run by a coalition of the Government, State, legal and medical professionals and property owners. The entire Irish establishment went along with this disgraceful situation. The damning revelations we have heard in the past week to ten days are not new; Official Ireland knew all about them. It knew what went on in these homes, including forced and illegal adoptions, the disgraceful burials and so on. The Irish establishment had full knowledge of and consented to this awful situation. State inspection reports described children as being fragile, pot-bellied and emaciated. Cause of death was regularly recorded as starvation.  The reaction of shock and horror in the past ten days by the State, members of the church and professionals is disingenuous and dishonest. I welcome the establishment of a commission of inquiry but withhold final judgment on it until I have had sight of its terms of reference. I want all homes to be investigated as part of the inquiry. Issues such as the role of the State, the church, State agencies and Departments, local authorities and inspectors; the profile and social status of the women in these homes; the mistreatment of mothers and babies; the burial procedures; forced and illegal adoptions; vaccine trials and so on must be examined. The issue of the Magdalen laundries and the question of redress must also be addressed by the inquiry. It must be timely and commence immediately.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	536	I commend the Government on its acceptance of the motion. I also commend Sinn Féin on tabling it. However, those whom I commend most are the people in the Visitors Gallery, including those who were here earlier when we were dealing with a modern example of the neglect of women and children in the provision of housing. It is a terrible stain not alone on our past but also on our present that the victims of these crimes, in the main, poor women and children, have had to fight to finally get an acknowledgement that a crime was committed against them. The historians and others who have trawled up the truth about what went on deserve great credit. As in the case of the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries and Bethany Home, it should not have taken that long, bitter struggle for people to get an acknowledgement of the crimes committed against them by the church and the State. It is not an exaggeration to say some of the things about which we have heard in Tuam and 800 skeletons being found in septic tanks are what one associates with the horrors of Nazi Germany in the Second World War, the greatest horror in human history. While what happened here is not quite on a par with it, there are elements that echo it. To think this happened in the early history of the State and continued into the 1970s is appalling.  I was born in a mother and baby home, from where I was adopted. I am a product of this system. I was one of the lucky ones who escaped, but others suffered a terrible faith. Children died of starvation or were used as guinea pigs, while families were ripped apart. It is an appalling stain on our history. It must be said the political establishment of the time colluded in a marriage of convenience with the Catholic Church to do this in order that it could selfishly control and keep down women, children and the poor in the most horrendous of circumstances. The people in the Visitors Gallery and others who are the products of this system deserve full accountability for everything done to them. Most importantly, we must ensure the mistreatment, abuse and neglect of women, children and the poor which continues to the present day is addressed.

I welcome the announcement made in recent days by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan. As this is the first occasion since his appointment on which I have spoken on an issue relating to children, I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and, in particular, the calm and constructive manner with which he has responded to this issue, despite hardly having his legs under the table. We can all argue that it should have been addressed a long time ago, but it is being addressed now. I welcome the structured manner in which the Minister is approaching the issue in terms of the establishment of an interdepartmental group to gather and collate all of the relevant documentation, which work, when completed at the end of this month, will feed into the commission of investigation which will have statutory powers to investigate the mother and baby homes. I cannot over-emphasise the fact that it is important that this matter be progressed in a methodical manner, with the pieces of the jigsaw being brought together and the real facts in relation to what happened in Tuam and elsewhere established. This needs to be done right. It would not be helpful - in fact, it could cause further hurt to those already suffering in silence - if the sensationalism we have witnessed in the media in recent days was to continue. I cannot see how it contributes in any way to addressing the issue. As we have seen in recent months, it takes time - in some cases, it has taken too long - to establish a commission of inquiry, but that has not happened in this case. It behoves all of us to hold our nerve and allow the interdepartmental group and the commission of investigation to get on with their work, establish the facts and reach their conclusions. What we need during this time is sensitivity rather than the sensationalism we have witnessed. I welcome the statements yesterday by the Taoiseach and the Minister that everybody who wishes to contribute will have an opportunity to do so. This is not and should not be about squabbling across the floor. It is about reaching conclusions, with an input from everybody on what the terms of reference should be. There is a need for a timeframe and a conclusion of this matter as quickly as possible. The terms of reference should not be so wide that everything that happened to children in this country since the Famine is investigated. It is important to get the balance right and that we are inclusive in how we go about setting the terms of reference for the inquiry. In the meantime, we should be more sensitive than sensational. Obviously, fingers will be pointed as a result of the commission's report on the appalling treatment of the mothers and babies, but let that be done by its authors. Let us not all start doing so from today. I agree with some of the Opposition's comments on the treatment of children in direct provision. We do not want a Dáil in 50 years to be inquiring into the appalling nature of direct provision. This needs to be dealt with, separately or otherwise. If there is some shadow here, light should be shone on it also.

I can sincerely say I am deeply saddened to learn of the extremely distressing treatment of babies and infants in the mother and baby home in Tuam. Unfortunately, this mother and baby home was not unique. It has become clear to me that such homes were like the moral dustbins for society at the time in question. They swept out of sight that which did not fit into the straitjacketed, warped view of how society should be, the then-Vatican's view of the world to the effect that every child should be born into a traditional family, of a married couple, and into a world with no contraceptives. This thinking regarded women as unclean and children as being born with mortal sin, and people who did not conform were locked in mental institutions. Anything that happened outside what was regarded as the sacred family structure was to be hidden and got rid of. As a society, we were complicit in this. It is too simplistic to lay the blame totally on the shoulders of the Bon Secours nuns. I must state categorically that there were no immaculate conceptions in the west of Ireland. Women and children were treated disgracefully, and the men, the fathers who impregnated the girls, seem to have walked away scot free. Were these girls who had babies victims of paedophilia, incest and feckless men? Irish society was an accomplice in this issue of the fallen woman. Families sent their daughters to these places. Families abandoned their own daughters and grandchildren. Many people knew what was happening and chose to ignore it and cover it up. This is an uncomfortable truth. I welcome the Minister's announcement to establish a commission of investigation. It is the first step towards establishing the full truth about this dark period. We must now coolly and calmly establish, with a strong degree of sensitivity, what exactly went on in the homes. The Minister has indicated the main questions that the commission will consider, namely, how the babies died and why the death rate in the homes was over three times the national average at the time. The poor, innocent children seem never to have stood a real chance at life. There is little evidence of them living and little evidence of them dying. Their existence was hidden away, and that was the wish of society at the time, not just that of the religious hierarchy. The commission must therefore question not only the role of the church but also that of the State and society as a whole. I am glad to hear the Irish Catholic bishops want the truth to emerge and that they have called for an independent commission of investigation with judicial powers. I hope the religious orders will co-operate. However, while misguided moral suppression of society at the time did warp people's views of what was right and wrong, the church alone cannot be a scapegoat for this. We must bear in mind the role of society at the time and the fact that many people knew what was happening and went along with it. We must look into our own hearts to determine what sort of society we had and have today. How do we treat our children today? How do we treat our children with disabilities, autism and Down's syndrome? How do we treat our women today? Yesterday, the National Women's Council of Ireland published a report showing that women are 30% more likely to be beaten in circumstances of domestic violence when they are pregnant. Today's business brings us back to the disturbing question of clinical trials in the homes in question. I refer to children being used as guinea pigs. Such trials were carried out in children's homes in my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. Medical professionals who oversaw the trials have insisted that the vaccines did no harm and were administered in the children's best interest. This is not acceptable today and was not acceptable in the past. It seems that the doctors effectively granted one another permission to proceed. The commission of investigation must investigate these drug trials.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	540	Irrespective of how far back we look into our history, we will realise it is one of abuse. Politically, socially and religiously, we have only known abuse. This nation was born of a refusal to be abused by the colonial powers. The struggle for a free Ireland was a struggle against abuse and was for and by both men and women. It is not unfair to say this struggle continues even today. Equality in our nation is still a dream for many marginalised individuals and groups. The legacy of abuse takes its toll personally and collectively. As the late author Paulo Freire said in his book Pedagogy of the Oppressed, “Looking at the past must only be a means of understanding more clearly what and who they [the oppressed] are so that they can more wisely build the future." However, before we can talk about forgiveness, we must be true and open about why and who carried out the abuse. It is essential that we as a people never shy away from the past. When one notes the rawness of the hurt of mothers and children from the homes, as described by some of them in the media recently, one realises the past we now talk about is not long ago at all. Therefore, I welcome the Government's decision to set up expeditiously a commission of investigation with statutory powers. Not all in the church abused and not all in the church were aware of the abuse taking place, yet the church as a hierarchy must own its sin, as it were. Where the State has colluded, it must take its share of the blame. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, dealt with this issue very well in his statement yesterday. The endeavour now is to address what happened in the context of the past before Ireland became what it is today. It is essential that what happened be seen in the light of what the Irish nation was at the time, with the church and State intertwined with the will of the people. The freedom of this nation came about only by expelling the colonial masters. For too long we operated under religious doctrines and allowed religious institutions to be answerable only to the religious hierarchy whose doctrines concerning unmarried mothers and their children were unchristian. Changes to our laws separating church and State, like the mandatory reporting of child abuse, go towards ensuring the past will not continue to rule our present and future. While the abuse and inhumanity perpetrated in secret and suffered by mothers and children in the homes has passed, we know the pain of the trauma still manifests itself because healing is required. The State can provide the vehicle for truth and justice that is required for the victims. Let me quote the spiritual teacher Iyanla Vanzant: "When you stand and share your story in an empowering way, your story will heal you and your story will heal somebody else." As we, as a nation, once again face dark revelations about our past, we do so with sadness. This is something we need to mourn. It is natural to blame and point a finger but, as a nation, we need to do more. We need to find our way past this and find forgiveness and healing. As we hear the stories of the many victims of the homes, we will allow the process of healing, not just for them but for ourselves as a nation.

It is not possible for the inquiry to examine mother and baby homes in isolation.These institutions were but pieces in the large jigsaw puzzle known as "religious Ireland". I wrote an article last year about a Scottish man who, in 1955, talked his way into the Tuam mother and baby home and the Magdalen laundry in Galway. The man was an author, researching a book about Ireland. His name was Dr. Halliday Sutherland and his experience of both visits is related in a chapter of his book, Irish Journey. It is important to say at the outset that Dr. Sutherland was obliged to receive permission for these visits from two bishops, Dr. Walsh, the Archbishop of Tuam, and Dr. Browne, the Bishop of Galway. The evidence is that the Catholic hierarchy was exercising clear control over the two orders of nuns in question. It should also be said that by instruction of the Bishop of Galway, Dr. Sutherland only received permission to visit the Magdalen laundry on agreement that he would submit his written manuscript to the mother superior of the Sisters of Mercy. It seems quite clear from this experience that the institutions were not autonomous entities and were, in fact, regulated by the religious orders whose names they carried, under the direction of a church hierarchy. This point carries much significance when considered in light of the repeated refusals by church authorities to pay redress moneys owed to victims and survivors of church abuse. When Dr. Sutherland visited the Tuam mother and baby home, he took note of the partnership-type arrangement that existed between the State and the Bon Secours Sisters in the operation of the home. Each unmarried mother worked at the Tuam home for one year without payment and, in addition, the institution received a grant of £1 per woman or child from Galway County Council every week. Any child not adopted by the age of seven was sent to an industrial school. If a woman was unfortunate enough to have two illegitimate pregnancies, then she was sent to the Magdalen laundry in Galway to work for the Sisters of Mercy. From just this one independent eyewitness account in 1955, we can identify a maze of interconnecting pieces of this jigsaw. The church hierarchy, the Bon Secours order, adoption societies, Galway County Council, the Galway Magdalen laundry, the Sisters of Mercy order, the industrial schools and the religious orders running the industrial schools were all linked directly to the Tuam mother and baby home. It is impossible, therefore, to inquire into the operation of a mother and baby home or, indeed, all mother and baby homes without considering all the pieces of the full jigsaw puzzle. For this reason, I look forward to further debate in this House on the terms of reference of this inquiry, which needs to be broad and carefully designed. The Minister's idea to scope promptly and carefully the inquiry prior to its establishment is a good one. Because Dr. Sutherland's 1955 account of his visit to the Tuam mother and baby home and the Galway Magdalen laundry was subject to the prior editorial approval of the mother superior of the Mercy order in Galway, I first wondered, when reading his book, how much the record had been sanitised for public consumption. I no longer have to wonder. Dr. Sutherland's grandson has provided me with a copy of his grandfather's original 21-page manuscript, edited by hand, with a sharp blue-inked fountain pen, by the then mother superior of the Mercy nuns in Galway, Sister Fidelma. The marked manuscript, which has been kept faithfully by the Sutherland family for nigh on 60 years, was attached to a covering letter signed by Sister Fidelma and stamped with her convent seal. The original script, together with Sister Fidelma's edits, tells a shocking story of punishment beatings, food deprivation and attempted escapes from the Magdalen laundry - one with devastating consequences. My intention, with the permission of Dr. Sutherland's grandson, is to hand this document over to the commission of inquiry. Given the clear links between the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes, in my view, it is simply not possible to contemplate an inquiry into one type of institution without also inquiring into the other type. I look forward to engaging further on the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. The scoping phase must consider the need to investigate the Magdalen laundries, the church hierarchy and all adoptions that occurred where the natural mothers were not independently legally advised, which really means all adoptions carried out under these circumstances. This may be under one inquiry or, perhaps more effectively, under a number of parallel but connected commissions of investigation. The important point is that all of these various aspects of Ireland's social and religious history are, in fact, closely connected and must be openly and thoroughly investigated together.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	542	From listening to the debate both inside and outside the House, it is very clear anger is growing in the country, not just about this but about the terrible things that have happened to women and children down through the ages. Tonight, we are particularly looking at the revelations and news we have heard in regard to mother and baby homes. Young women were forcibly separated first from their communities, then from any sense of pride or self worth and then from their babies. Their babies were neglected and starved, with illnesses untreated. They were seen as worthless and buried, ultimately, in unmarked graves, left in the end without even an identity. We know that this happened as a manifestation of official policy. Young women were separated and confined in what can only be described as prisons in order to enforce a stigma of shame. They were declared to be unequal and treated accordingly. We hope we have changed - of course, we do. However, what of the children's referendum that was passed almost two years ago and is still not signed into law? If it was a fiscal referendum, would we still be waiting for it to be signed into law? What of the children in direct provision? Are they to be the next scandal visited upon us? What of the child death inquiries of the children in care, where over 230 children died in State care? Alcohol was seen as one of the top risk factors in all of those cases, yet we fail to regulate and examine the problem this country has with alcohol. This commission must be the one that puts an end to commissions of inquiry which solely examine, let us be honest, why women were treated as second class citizens because of their biology. By that, I mean the women in the Magdalen laundries, the women who suffered symphysiotomy, the hepatitis C women, Savita and the women in the mother and baby homes. It is shameful that this country has sought, and to this day seeks, to treat women as second class citizens. This commission must be the one to end inquiries into our shameful past. I hope we will be able, in the lifetime of this Government, to shine a light on those very dark and shameful episodes that have happened in the past but also in our very recent past. We must act to protect women and children. I hope those who have records will come forward and that we will not have people who will withhold evidence. We must have co-operation from all of those engaged in this horrific part of our history. What we are talking about here are very young, poor women and sometimes girls who were treated as unequal, as second class citizens and as prisoners because of their biology. We must make sure this commission seeks not just to investigate the mother and baby homes but also the tangled web this State, the church and society pushed women and children through because they did not want to see what was going on in front of them. The word "outcast" derives from medieval times. When young girls and women became pregnant and were unmarried, they were asked to leave the village and live outside it because they were a burden and could not be fed or looked after. They often died in the woods because of malnutrition and exposure. That was in medieval times and "outcast" was a medieval term, yet in modern times and in modern terms, women, because of their biology, are treated as second class citizens. I commend the first steps we have taken as a Government in regard to the establishment of the commission but we must get this right. We must make sure this commission is the commission to end inquiries into why we treat women and have treated women in this country as second class citizens because of their biology.

We cannot fail to acknowledge all these facets of what happened. We cannot deny that all of us contributed to it, whether it was by making a bar-room joke that led to the prejudice that led to the ignorant reaction, or by any other means. There was mass buy-in, to use an awful contemporary phrase. There was mass acceptance of it. Evil does not occur without a culture and atmosphere to facilitate it. There was prejudice, ignorance and a horrific attitude to the women and babies that gained expression. No element of society can escape it. The State and the people who ran the homes bore responsibility. Every facet of society bore responsibility. It was a dark period in our history. One cannot dress it up or romanticise it. This must be the kernel of anything we say.  A point that has been made that merits being made again is that the privacy of those who lived in the homes and who do not wish to be part of the public debate or media coverage should be respected. Obviously, the commission, whose establishment I welcome, should look at infant mortality, burial arrangements, vaccine trials and practices around adoption. There should be no element of this extraordinarily dark period in our history - this harrowing and very difficult time - that escapes the scrutiny of the commission and is swept under the carpet.  The commission will be able to compel witnesses, to provide for costs where people are not co-operating and to obtain access to all of the information, so it will have strong powers. It is important that this is accepted. It is an efficient and comprehensive way of dealing with what happened. It is the most sensible immediate response. There can be no hiding from any element of this. The interdepartmental work that has been done by way of background will help set the terms of reference and provide a context. It is not inappropriate. It is very appropriate for us to say that every agency in the State, all archives and all the machinery of the State must be opened up and made available to the commission of inquiry.  In that context, we must welcome the statements from the bishops that they will ensure complete co-operation. It should be no other way, but it merits acknowledgement. Obviously, the commission's work will not be confined to Tuam, and I commend the Minister on that, because it must embrace the entire country. There is not much more we can say other than to support the establishment of the commission, acknowledge our collective guilt and ensure that the women, babies and families receive a sensitive response. There must be a holistic response. I support the adoption campaign which said this morning that counselling should be introduced immediately. I believe that should be the case. Of course, a formal State apology should be given. We should do everything that will in any way ameliorate the situation. We are coming into the decade of commemoration, but while we commemorate other aspects of our history, we cannot deny this as a very real part of our history. We must confront it and accept its reality. It has to guide us to deal with the victims but must also guide future policy so that we develop a sensitive, humane policy that will never allow a recurrence of what happened.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	545	It is appropriate to begin my remarks by applauding the women and men who have campaigned for many long years to achieve recognition of what happened in institutions across this country - recognition of the abusive and degrading treatment suffered by women and their children in mother and baby homes, county homes, children's homes, orphanages, Magdalen laundries and beyond. The idea of punishing a woman for her pregnancy is frankly abhorrent. Yet that is what happened in our country. Generations of unmarried pregnant women faced not only isolation, stigmatisation and cruelty but also the ultimate inhumane sanction of having their babies taken from them. It is hard to fathom all of this. I struggle to understand or grasp such an intensely vindictive act as to take a child from its frightened, vulnerable mother. Yet that is what happened in thousands of cases. Many women who lived through this trauma are still around to tell the tale. Some of them have done so very bravely and publicly. A woman spoke at a gathering in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in County Tipperary about two weeks ago. I had the honour of being in that gathering. She had her baby in that institution. She left without her baby. She suspects her baby is buried somewhere under the ground where we stood, but she cannot be sure. Her story is sadly echoed in cases the length and breadth of this country. Now is the moment when we face up to that. It was Catherine Corless who painstakingly and faithfully discovered the names of the almost 800 infants and children who died at the Bon Secours institution in Tuam. Catherine Corless, Teresa Killeen-Kelly and their mother and babies committee deserve much credit, as do those campaigners who have worked and fought for recognition. It has been a long road and I want to welcome many of them to the public gallery this evening. Tuam was not an isolated case. Our motion this evening makes clear that the investigation into events at the Bon Secours institution must be replicated in mother and baby homes and other institutions. It is essential that this commission is not selective in its approach. It would be a glaring contradiction and a profound injustice to include some survivors and exclude others. It would be a farce to pretend that any investigation of women and children in mother and baby institutions could be carried out without including the Magdalen laundries. The McAleese report did not and could not establish the full story of women and children's experiences in the laundries. It could not and did not establish the relationship, the traffic and the interplay between the laundries and the mother and baby homes. It is impossible to get to the bottom of the mother and baby home story without understanding and finally and fully confronting what happened in the laundries. It is therefore essential that the scope of the inquiry includes the Magdalen laundries. I would like the Minister and Government to commit to their inclusion this evening.  It is also essential that institutions that have been ignored or set aside are included. Many of these were Protestant in ethos, such as the Ovoca Manor and Westbank orphanages located in County Wicklow, and the Church of Ireland Magdalen home based in Dublin. I welcome the fact that finally the Government has recognised the survivors of the Bethany Home. Their inclusion is long overdue. The role of sadness and death in that home in Rathgar is engraved on a memorial stone in Mount Jerome cemetery where just last April the forgotten, lost children of the home were given the dignity of their names at their final resting place. That dignity of recognition and identity and of being named must be afforded to every infant and child that lies in an unmarked plot or grave. Survivors at this stage have made it abundantly clear that they desire memorial stones for all these infants and children and their wish should be respected and accommodated at the earliest opportunity. Despite protestations to the contrary, this abuse happened in clear view of society. We, undoubtedly, as a society have questions to answer and lessons to learn from our negligence and cruelty, our fear of authority and our compliance with things that, on reflection, none of us would stand over. That such organised systematic abuse happened with the active involvement of the religious and churches is an utter perversion of anything that anyone might reasonably call Christian. Church leaders and religious orders must step forward and measure up to their responsibility, co-operate, apologise and make reparations. The State alibi until recently has been that these awful abusive events happened in private institutions and somehow, therefore, it was not, and is not, accountable or liable for the violations of women's and children's rights. I am sure the Minister will agree this is patent nonsense. This abuse happened with the clear sanction and connivance of the State and this is the most devastating reality of all. It is important that we establish the full facts of what happened behind institutional walls and gates and of what happened to women and children in these institutions and beyond. We demand an explanation for the infant and child mortality rates and the vaccine trials and we want answers around the forced illegal adoptions from these institutions. In other words, we want the terms of reference of this inquiry to be comprehensive and we expect Government to honour its commitment to consult the Opposition parties and, above all, the survivors and their advocates. We will not accept from Government any attempt to cherry-pick institutions to be included with others excluded. Victims and survivors, mothers and their babies were grievously wronged by society, the churches and the State. They were deserving of, and entitled to, their human rights and dignity. There are no excuses or alibis and there is nowhere for anyone to hide. They deserve, and they must receive, a full and wholesome apology. None of them was ever, to use the awful phrase, "illegitimate". The State, the churches and society acted illegitimately and broke every rule and boundary of decency, morality and the rule of the law. The Government has an opportunity because of the courage and perseverance of survivors and campaigners to put things right. The Minister should not throw this opportunity away. The challenge is for Government to match the fierce dignity and courage of those who have stepped forward to demand justice for mothers and their babies. The motion is about the past but, in a profound way, all this is about the here and now. It is about us asserting the kind of Ireland in which we live, the manner in which we value our women and children and the extent to which we are prepared to recognise wrongs and to apologise and own up to them. Time is of the essence. Survivors and victims need recognition, support and redress now. I would like to quote the words of a survivor. He said:It would be best to come clean now. This problem is partly due to governments in the past selecting who gets justice and who in their eyes does not deserve the truth. The abuse continues until all the homes are included. The issue is not going to go away because the brave souls who survived to testify their experience aren't going away.A wise Minister and a wise Government would heed these words.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	546	I welcome the fact that the Government seems to have accepted the spirit of the motion and the need to move as quickly as possible to investigate all aspects of the horrific stories, which have emerged not just recently but over the past decade and a half. The inquiry needs to extend to all cases highlighted in the past and to all cases into which full inquires have not been conducted, despite the appeals of former residents. The inquiry must include the Bethany Home and the disturbing practices that took place there, which were similar to what happened in the Tuam mother and baby home, where a large number of children were buried in unmarked graves. The death rate in these homes is striking. When one takes into account the death certificates that have been found, the number of children who died in all these homes, including the Bethany Home, is high. At the time the mortality rate for children in the State was high because of disease and various other reasons but mortality rates in the homes were excessive and extraordinary by any standard and this must be examined. The children in these homes died at a much higher rate than those living with their families. It is a scandal that this happened and this must be fully investigated. The Sean Ross Abbey home in County Tipperary is on the border of my constituency. The home operated under the Sacred Heart Sisters for 40 years until 1970 and it was the subject of the film "Philomena", which focused on forced adoptions from it. The home has a large burial plot, which contains numerous bodies of babies. We do not know how many are in it and it could be hundreds. Yesterday, I was contacted by a constituent who only discovered the other day that he was born in Sean Ross Abbey. He is aged 51 and he is one of the lucky ones who survived. He wants answers. He wants to know why his mother was committed to the home and whether he was the subject of an adoption or whether he was boarded out. He wants a copy of his medical records. He has many questions but there are no answers for him at the moment. We need to know what went on in homes such as Sean Ross Abbey. Adoption is a particularly sensitive issue, given the comments of mothers who claim they were forced to give up their children for adoption. Many of the children were adopted overseas and this presents a massive legacy issue, which needs to be handled sensitively in order that separated families can find out what happened during the adoption process and in order that they can be reunited. We must also examine the use of children as guinea pigs in vaccine trials, which were not approved. It is a scandal that this happened. How many children died as a result of the trials? Who authorised and monitored them? Who benefited from them? There has rightly been a significant focus on the religious orders who ran the homes and there is a major responsibility on the surviving members of those orders who have information to come forward. In doing so, however, we must also look at the State's role over a 50 to 60 year period.The people who have the power, the Ministers in the Cabinet, must do everything they can to try to get answers, particularly for the survivors, many of whom are elderly. Those people and their children are entitled to answers as to what happened. Hopefully the inquiry will focus on these matters and get answers, so we will be able to shed more light on what was a very dark period in our history. We have a responsibility to those people to expose this and ensure they get redress.

We cannot underestimate the enormity of the challenge of this investigation, but in equal measure we cannot overstate the importance of the truth to the tens of thousands of women who bore and lost their children in these institutions in such cruel circumstances. A total of 796 children died in the Bon Secours home in Tuam between 1925 and 1961. I commend the work of all the individuals who have shed light into these dark corners of our history and who have given these forgotten mothers and babies a voice. We must also remember the 219 Bethany Home children who, until recently, lay in an unmarked grave in Dublin. Despite the wealth of evidence detailing State involvement and oversight in the homes and the barbaric neglect of babies and young children, the Government has yet fully to acknowledge wrongdoing. Derek Leinster, chairperson of the Bethany Survivors Group described the horrific neglect he experienced following his birth in the institution:At seven and a half months old I was nursed out to Mrs. Shirley, my head was a mass of puss, blood and scabs. I looked like a ghost. They nursed me back to normal health. I was then taken back to Bethany when I was two and a half years old, to be permanently adopted by another family - that did not happen. There were many children in the Bethany Home who suffered from rickets. I then became very ill and was lucky that they had left enough time to give Cork Street isolation hospital a chance to save my life. I had bronchial pneumonia, diphtheria, pertussis and gastroenteritis.This is from just one of the individuals from that home who was lucky enough to survive. There must be no distinction between Catholic, Protestant or State homes in the commission of inquiry. All mother and baby homes must be included, as well as the Magdalen laundries. This commission of investigation is an opportunity, which should be grabbed with both hands, to include all those who have been gravely wronged by institutions of any kind. Tens of thousands of women across the decades lost their children in these homes. They lived in a society in which they had a deeply ingrained stigma that is nearly impossible for us to understand today. In short, they were outlawed by many of our grandparents, and the religious orders were employed to oversee their punishment. It is of pivotal importance that we investigate the heartbreaking wrongs for a number of reasons, but primarily to bring belated justice to the women and babies involved. There is also a need to get to the truth. In recent weeks there has been a swirl of media reports, most of it shockingly true but some of it wide of the mark. There must also be an investigation to ensure that we learn from our past. Shockingly this State still mistreats mothers and children. I refer in particular to direct provision. Nutrition there is an ongoing issue, particularly for children. The Irish Refugee Council has reported cases of the HSE offering to take children into care, or partial care, in cases of severe malnourishment instead of simply ensuring that parents have enough to feed their children properly. Residents are literally imprisoned in direct provision for years. I have met adults who have spent their formative years in direct provision and on completion of their leaving certificate are prevented from working, attending college and much else. They are unable to escape. In this decade, one child in the HSE system dies every fortnight, 513 children went missing while in State care between 2000 and 2010 and the whereabouts of 440 children are unknown. Only recently we saw the disgraceful debacle of the Government, in practical terms, taking medical care from children with life-long illnesses or disabilities through the medical card review. We owe it to the families who are torn apart by the mother and child homes to uncover the wrongs, and we owe it to the mothers and children of this generation not to repeat them.

Bhí cruinniú mór daoine lasmuigh agus iad ag abair amhrán agus ag tabhairt saghas solidarity dár gcairde. Sinn Féin welcomes the Government's decision to establish a commission of investigation and its commitment to engage with the Opposition. We will hold the Government to this commitment. I do not say this from any sense of moral superiority. This is our responsibility. We also believe that survivors should be consulted on the terms of reference. Given the age of the survivors, many of whom are infirm, counselling and redress schemes should be put in place as quickly as possible. We believe the terms of reference must cover the effective imprisonment of pregnant women in mother and baby homes; the taking of babies from their mothers against their will; the cause of the shocking infant mortality rates at mother and baby homes; the circumstances surrounding the burial of children and babies who died at these homes; the routine illegal adoption and trafficking to the USA and elsewhere of an unknown number of children; and the subjection of children to medical trials without the consent of their mothers. We believe the commission should be established before the summer recess. We welcome the commitment yesterday that Bethany Home is belatedly included in the commission of investigation. However, other institutions, such as the Magdalen laundries, should also be included. I commend the efforts of Catherine Corless, the Adoption Rights Alliance, other activists and especially the survivors who have worked to expose the injustice of these homes. We would not be having this debate and there would be no commission of investigation if it were not for the work of the survivors and their friends. Women were denied their rights as citizens and they were treated as slaves. Children who did not die were left scarred for the rest of their lives. Some were treated as guinea pigs in vaccine experiments. Who gave permission for these actions to be carried out? Who authorised the use of Irish children for vaccine trials? Who was paid? How much did successive Governments know? When did this Government know of this dreadful scandal? For many citizens there is genuine bewilderment at the scale of the abuse, the numbers who died and their treatment after death. For some commentators, the responsibility and blame for this is being laid at the door of society. I have been trying to understand this. In this version of events everybody is to blame and everybody is at fault. However, everybody is not to blame. The victims are not to blame. It is as if the virtual imprisonment of unmarried girls and women and the theft of their children were a natural outworking of Irish society in that period of our history. However, that is too simplistic a picture. It seeks benignly or inadvertently to excuse the decisions that were taken by the elites in the State and church. As Deputy Ó Caoláin told the Dáil yesterday, this can be too easily twisted into a view that since everyone was to blame, nobody was to blame. That is not good enough. It is a fact that after Partition a conservative, mean spirited, narrow-minded political and business elite in this State, in alliance with the Catholic Church hierarchy, put in place laws, institutions and censorship restrictions which were anti-women, chauvinistic, cruel, prejudiced, intolerant and anti-working class. The thousands of women who endured unbelievable hardship were denied everything by the State. The agencies and institutions of the State are to blame.These unmarried women broke no laws and the commission of investigation must reveal the truth of that experience and those responsible for it. The victims of this abuse should feel no shame. I make the point again, "You did no wrong." At a vigil outside Leinster House there was a celebration in solidarity of song, music and poetry. One speaker said, "The victims need validation." That is the very least we can give them, with our love, respect and thanks for their strength and courage.

It is difficult to read and even harder to understand. Can we truly say what happened is surprising? In 2002, when I came into the Dáil, there had been calls to investigate the horrific crimes committed in residential institutions. The focus was narrow. We had a partial apology from the Taoiseach at the time and established the redress board, the structures of which compounded the hurt, according to many of the victims. The State apologised to a certain section, but many groups were left out. From the first investigations and State apologies which cruelly left out the likes of the Magdalen laundries to the imperfect and selective McAleese inquiry which left out the likes of Bethany Home and others, we have seen the State continue to fail the tragic victims and survivors of various institutions. We failed them collectively once by leaving them out and we have continued to fail them to this day by denying them justice. These appalling events did not happen in the dark distant past. Pregnant women were still being sent to the Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes right up to the 1980s. Westbank in Greystones only closed in 2002. It is clear that gender, class and power were all at play. If a citizen was female, poor, lacked an education or had the audacity to challenge the religious ethos of the time which dominated the health and education systems, she was isolated and marginalised. Some were locked up, treated and used as prisoners and economic slaves. Women citizens were treated as a subspecies which was impure, tainted and even dangerous. The men who got many of these women pregnant did not lose their positions or standing in Irish society. Women's children were starved and disease, including TB, was rampant. The child mortality rate was massively higher in these institutions than among the general public and the State allowed this to go on. Many babies born in these institutions were immediately taken from their mothers and put up for forced and illegal adoption as quickly as possible. Many of the survivors do not know what homes they were in. Can we apologise to them, even though they do not know from which institutions they came? Will we look at the possibility of including them? There are people who have a difficulty in obtaining passports and realise they were living under the wrong name through no fault of their own. We heard that children were treated as guinea pigs and used without consent in vaccine trials. Women and their children were ignored, abused and shunned in life and hidden away in death. We must deal with this dark and difficult issue once and for all. No home or group should be left out of any inquiry and full powers must be provided for investigating authorities to ensure justice is done. We must learn from the past. With all of these inquiries and investigations, can we learn and improve? Can we do things differently? Can we be more inclusive? Will we continue to prolong the hurt experienced by the people concerned? We have a chance to be inclusive or exclusive. We have been exclusive in the past. Surely, it is time to include all homes in this process and that is what I urge the Government to do. The motion suggests the way forward. Surely, we can all work together to make this better. Perhaps, we might try to do things differently in the future. We have certainly done things in the wrong way in the past. There is an opportunity for us to do things differently collectively. I urge the Government to look clearly at what we are suggesting. Those who were hurt are the heroes. No one is here to sensationalise or make insensitive remarks, but it will be insensitive and wrong if we fail to include people who have been hurt.

The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and I appreciate the co-operation that has been given by the House on this very sensitive matter. These sensitivities are foremost in the minds of Members who are deeply aware that there are people in Ireland who continue to live with the reality of the issues discussed. There is a need to be mindful of their circumstances and ensure public commentary does not add to any distress they might feel. We have noted the contributions of all Deputies and the issues they have highlighted which have been brought into the public domain by the events in Tuam. I am sure that all in the House will agree that the many issues raised are problematic and deeply troubling. I emphasise the Government's commitment to getting this right. Deputy Robert Troy stated last night that there was never a right time to do the wrong thing. The Government is convinced that this is the time to do the right thing by the women and children whose lives were shaped by the events that took place in the last century in Ireland's mother and baby homes. However, we must be realistic in our approach. There is a need to establish the facts. It must be borne in mind that they may be hard to unearth and deeply unpalatable for many. I am pleased that the debate of the last two days in the Chamber has shed light on the level of complicity of all strands of Irish life in what was happening in mother and baby homes and the degree to which society turned a blind eye and allowed others to deal with issues it had simply decided to ignore. I ask those who have survived time in these institutions to be aware of the national contact preference register operated by the Adoption Authority. There, in the strictest confidence and with the utmost sympathy, efforts can be made to address the issue of giving an identity to the many children affected by their births in mother and baby homes. As he stated last night, the Minister intends to drive this process forward and ensure the commission of investigation will get under way in a timely manner. The appropriate terms of reference and a suitable expert membership will be developed for the commission of investigation. In developing the terms of reference consideration will be given by the interdepartmental group, in the first instance, to all of the matters to which Deputies have referred, including the institutions to be included in the review, infant mortality rates, the links between mother and baby homes and other institutions, adoptions from these facilities, illegal registrations, informal care arrangements such as boarding out, vaccines and medical issues, forced labour, institutional abuse, children being sent to the United States of America, the need for the living history of those affected by this issue to be acknowledged and recorded and the need for a proper resting place and memorial for those children who died in mother and baby homes. The group will consider all of these issues when making recommendations to the Government. I again thank all Deputies who have approached the matter with the utmost sensitivity and understanding and look forward to continuing engagement across the House in finalising arrangements for the commission of investigation.This Government is doing the right thing in trying to establish the truth of a dark chapter in our history and, in doing so, honouring the memory of those who are no longer with us and offering solace and support to those who are.

God knows but we have many reasons to come up wanting in that judgment, not just in the past but today, when sick people have to fight, beg and shout to get help. There is a lot of talk about the times that were in it then, when women who were pregnant outside the strict rules of Irish society were treated as outcasts, often rejected by their families and hidden away like some dirty secret. It is this aspect of this sorry episode of our history that I wish to address - the secrets that are kept in archives, files and records all over the State. There is a need for a full inquiry into what happened. We might hope in our hearts that there are no more horrors to be revealed and that a proper inquiry will stop the drip feed of suffering and pain that has poured out of our history of the treatment of women and children in Ireland. Let us start any inquiry with the records that exist. They must be released by all and every organisation, State body or religious order that holds them. If they are not already under the auspices of the National Archives of Ireland and if there is legislation, regulation, by-law or whatever is needed, then let us do it without delay. Catriona Crowe, head of special projects at the National Archives of Ireland, is on record as saying that she knows that the files of the biggest mother and baby home in the country, St. Patrick's on the Navan Road in Dublin, are in the possession of the HSE. That could mean that old health board files all over the State contain the records of these mother and baby homes. Two religious orders ran these homes, as far as I am aware - the Sisters of Bon Secours and the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. They must have records, not only of the admissions, births and deaths that happened under their supervision. Did they hand their records over to the health boards, or have they still got them in their possession? If they have them, what do they record about the women and babies who were in their institutions? Do they need work to get them into chronological order and what details do they contain? There must also be record of the administrative relationship between these orders of nuns and the State. There must be financial accounts. Did the religious orders get paid by the State for running these places? Are there records of payments from the pharmaceutical companies who carried out medical trials on children in these homes? Have the companies got the results of their medical trials recorded? What of the dioceses in which these homes existed? Are there records of the orders' relationships with their religious mentors and bishops? The General Register Office, GRO, should hold all the records of births and deaths. This is where Catherine Corless, to whom this State owes a debt for her work to date, found the death certificates of the Tuam babies. She paid for them out of her pocket and should be congratulated for her dedication and commitment to the work she has revealed to us. The GRO should be asked to hand over what it has, without waiting for an inquiry to ask for it and every Catholic and Protestant diocese in Ireland should be asked to do the same. If what we already know is anything to go by, we will be horrified all over again by what these records reveal but I ask for the files to be opened and to let it all come out now, once and for all, because that is the only way to deal with the tragedy that it is. That said, I am aware of the living women who were victims of such a system and who were wrongly terrified into silence for years. Women out there are still not able to tell their loved ones about lost babies, dead babies or babies sold off to adoption boards. They are victims of the society that made them feel that a normal, healthy sex life was a crime and one so serious that they deserved any pain and suffering that came after. The pain they felt most was the taking of their babies but, for some of them, that pain continues because the lie was told so long ago and the secret kept for so long that to reveal them now would damage precious relationships made after the birth and loss of their first babies. These women should be reassured at the setting up of any inquiry that they will not be exposed against their will and that discretion and their right to confidentiality will be maintained. Hopefully, for some of them, that secret can at last be revealed and they will get the help they need to talk about their experiences in a way that will bring healing and not further suffering to their lives. This motion is tabled in the knowledge that this country needs to deal with the past. We cannot move forward unless we do. I urge all Members to support the motion. I hope that what has been exposed over the past weeks and years will purify a rotten system that existed between the leadership of the church and the State in this country. It destroyed the lives of many.

Ta súil agam go dtiocfaidh toradh maith as, ach go háirithe dóibh siúd a d'fhulaing sna hinstitiúdí thar blianta fada. I thank all the Deputies who participated in this debate. It was essential that we address these matters promptly and fully in the Dáil and that is why Sinn Féin used its Private Members' time to have the motion debated. I join colleagues in welcoming our special guests in the Visitors Gallery. They are very welcome. Yesterday, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, announced that the Cabinet had agreed to the establishment of a commission of investigation. We welcome that. It is regrettable that the Minister was not able to stay to the end of the debate and I hope he will return. It is essential now that we set the proper and appropriate terms of reference for the commission of investigation. Its scope needs to be wide enough to cover all the key issues in the scandal of mother and baby homes. At the same time, the terms of reference need to be clear and comprehensive, while making possible a timely conclusion to the work of the investigation. The commission of investigation must not focus only on the Bon Secours institution in Tuam but on all such mother and baby homes and similar institutions that existed in the State in that era. It is essential there is a full examination of the regimes in those institutions and I will not, from this point forward, refer to them as homes. This must include the manner in which the women were treated - their accommodation, their food, their medical care or lack of it, and the work the women were required to do. It must include also the manner in which the children were treated. It must find out why the infant and child mortality rates were so high in these institutions, because they were extraordinarily high at a time of high, but gradually falling, infant mortality rates in Irish society generally. The commission of investigation must investigate the extent of neglect of the children, especially in terms of malnourishment for which there are many indications. It must address the appalling practice of experimentation with vaccines on these children. To what extent were the children used as guinea pigs and to what extent were pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals involved? A key question is the relationship between these institutions and the relevant State authorities of the time. What was the financial relationship and to what extent do records of this relationship still exist? Did religious orders continue to receive payments from the State for deceased children? What of institutions directly under the aegis of the State, through the health boards or their predecessors? It is important that the Bethany Home is included in this investigation. We addressed that scandal by way of Dáil debate previously and the survivors still do not have the means of finding out the full truth, which they are seeking.Adoption practices were central to the operation of these places. It is impossible to envisage any comprehensive investigation which does not thoroughly investigate the issue of adoptions - forced, unauthorised and illegal. Much of the great reservoir of hurt that still remains is among those surviving mothers whose babies were taken from them against their will and without their consent. None of us can imagine the lifelong grief of a woman whose child has been taken from her so cruelly and who has lived with the knowledge that the child is probably alive, but separated from her by an impenetrable wall. Or, just as cruelly, that the child may have died without ever knowing his or her birth mother. There is the great hurt also of surviving children who have been denied information about their parents, siblings and wider family. The burial practices in these institutions obviously must be central to the work of the commission of investigation. How many children were buried without coffins in unmarked graves? Can all these graves, or most of them, be located and marked? Can the identities of those children be established and their families traced and informed? There is also the scandal of the use of the bodies of dead children from mother and baby institutions for medical research, again, without the consent of their mothers. This too must be examined in the course of the investigation. In setting the terms of reference, there must be full and honest consultation with all views in this House, with the representative groups and the individuals directly concerned, and above all with the surviving mothers from these institutions and the children born in or adopted from them. I want to pay special tribute to them for speaking out and seeking the truth and I want to assure them that we all want to see them vindicated. There needs to be a timetable for the commission of investigation and the possible reporting on the different issues on a phased but time-limited basis merits consideration. Above all there should be no ambiguity about the type of commission of investigation being set up. It must be a statutory commission of investigation, under the Commission of Investigations Act 2004, with the power to compel witnesses to give evidence and to compel the production of documents. Nothing else will do.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	554	I will come to that in a moment. Bear with me. One thing is for sure, the Minister has not been listening to me, because he left the Chamber before I got up to speak. While such a commission was signalled in the Minister's statement yesterday, we are concerned that his amendment to our motion does not state this in explicit terms. As he knows well, I have tried repeatedly over the past 36 hours to reach an agreement with him on the wording of the motion or counter motion that will be put before the Members this evening. The Minister's counter motion or amendment is flawed. It does not deliver the certainty the victims of these institutions deserve. It does not reflect the commitments he gave in his oral contribution yesterday or to which he referred in the past few moments. That is a concern for me and for others listening to this debate. That said, as I have indicated to the Minister repeatedly, we do not want to divide the Dáil on this issue this evening. Therefore, on behalf of Sinn Féin, I am indicating to the Minister, in the spirit I believe is required as we go forward with these matters, that we will not oppose the Government amendment. Instead, we will work on the basis of trust, not only in what the Minister has committed to, but more especially in what the Taoiseach committed to here yesterday and what other voices, including the Minister's colleague tonight, committed to in the course of this debate. We believe that is the way to proceed. That said, let it be noted clearly and carefully that we and all who truly want truth and justice for the victims and survivors of these hellish institutions will be watching and waiting and holding the Minister and the Government to their commitment to act as they have stated here repeatedly over the two days of these statements and debate. I believe we have collectively made progress this week towards finding the truth and I hope I will have no reason to revisit that view in the future. The former residents of these horrendous institutions, those still living and those who died in them or after leaving them deserve nothing less. Let us all ensure they are let down no more.
