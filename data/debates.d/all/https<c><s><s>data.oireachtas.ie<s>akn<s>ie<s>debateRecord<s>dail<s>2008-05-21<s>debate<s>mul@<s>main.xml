          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Since his appointment as leader of his party and his election to his new office, the Taoiseach has made several notable contributions with which I agree in respect of the delivery of outcomes and value for taxpayers' money.  Nobody could disagree with those sentiments.  However, what concerns me is the translation of that into effect.  Before the Government arrives at a position where money is allocated, situations are assessed, reports are commissioned, objectives are set out and money is then allocated to achieve those targets and objectives.  That is the normal procedure, going through the Department of Finance via the line Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">However, I will point to two examples where this process has slipped seriously.  In 2006 and 2007, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, the Government allocated €18 million and approved 130 posts in the area of palliative care services.  Everybody in this House understands what palliative care means for elderly people who have a range of complex illnesses and may not have a good quality of life.  Under the palliative care service proposals, the intention was that home care packages would be provided so that comfort, social contact, physiotherapy, chiropractory and other services would be available to older people in their own homes.  Elderly people want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.  This point of contact with their home place is important for their comfort and mental well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">However, by May of this year, less than half the approved posts had been filled and only one in three in the three least developed regions.  I see the Tánaiste is offering the Taoiseach some advice.  I hope she is better informed of the figures in this instance than she was when she made her comments yesterday on the European Commission.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Millions of euro which were allocated by the Government for legitimate objectives and targets in the palliative care area have disappeared.  In other words, the money is not being spent for the purpose for which it was allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">That is not the only area in which this has happened.  The provision of mental health services is an issue that has been raised by Deputy Neville on many occasions.  Between 2006 and 2007, €50 million was allocated by the Government for the implementation of its mental health policy, A Vision for Change, but that money has not been spent accordingly.  The losers in this case are persons suffering from mental illness throughout the State who are desperately trying to access psychiatric services.  We are all aware of tragic cases which occurred in the last 12 to 15 months where people were unable to access psychiatric services, with tragic consequences either for themselves or others.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In the case of both palliative care and mental health services, money allocated for legitimate objectives by the Government was not spent for that purpose.  The Taoiseach allocated that money and somebody took it away.  The Minister for Health and Children has said on more than one occasion that it is wrong to spend money if we do not know where it is going.  Why is it that in these two cases, money allocated was not spent for the purpose for which it was intended?  Why was it diverted and on whose authority was that done?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_8">One of the main issues we face in trying to reform the health service is ensuring that resources are not continually put into acute services but that we provide more for community services and improve the frontline services in communities.  In regard to mental health care, change has been ongoing for more than two decades in terms of providing community based facilities and trying to end inappropriate placements for people in mental hospitals who, under modern psychiatric circumstances, could be far better treated in the community.  This initially met with some community resistance because of people's lack of knowledge that such care settings could be established within residential areas.  They have since proved to be a great success because of the support of community organisations which have helped people understand that persons in that situation are capable of having a more fulfilling life in the community than in institutional settings.  That has been going on for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">A problem with our health system has been the level of resources taken up in the provision of acute services.  Some 70% of the total budget is expended for this purpose.  It is true that the full allocation was not expended in the areas of mental health and palliative care last year.  In regard to palliative care, direction has been given to the management of the health service this year to ensure the allocation is expended in this financial year.  This has meant an increased provision of service and a much increased allocation to the voluntary hospice movement which does——</p>

          <p eId="para_14">There are budgetary pressures every year in regard to the health budget and managers have to manage the situation as they see it.  In some cases, this has meant that some new development areas have not seen the level of expenditure in a given financial year as was originally envisaged.  Working within budget allocations is a particularly difficult task, especially in the health service, but it is one that must be respected if we are to have sustainable improvements in the future.  In the case of both mental health and palliative care, I expect the allocated moneys will be expended this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">Were the bonuses for HSE management paid?  That is the question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_20">That does not answer the question.  The Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance who made these allocations, and rightly so.  Since his election as leader of his party and Taoiseach, he has pointed out that his priorities are health, delivery and outcomes.  How can we have a situation whereby Ministers are allocated money by the Minister for Finance for specific targets and objectives which is not spent in those areas?  That is the problem.  As Deputy McCormack pointed out, the bonuses were not cut for managers and front line staff are not being recruited, with the result that on 13 May 2008 the Joint Committee on Health and Children heard evidence in respect of palliative care, which as Deputy Reilly regularly points out deals with people suffering terminal illnesses, the average waiting time for a hospice is eight days.  The longest wait is 20 days but many of the people concerned do not have 20 days.  The bonuses for managers are not cut, yet all the money allocated by the Taoiseach is unaccounted for and has disappeared.  The Minister for Health and Children has said there is no point in spending money if one does not know where it is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I have had some difficulties with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, who is not in the House this morning, but I give him credit for saying on "Prime Time" that he was shocked at what was happening and the volume of money which was not being spent where it was allocated.  He called a special meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children at which presentations were made by those involved in caring for the elderly and the hospice movement.  He stated: "We do not have the authority to raise funds within this committee but we can ensure that funding allocated within the budget is spent within guidelines and headings."  He went on to give this commitment:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_22">...that funding allocated in 2006, 2007 and 2008 will be spent specifically in the appropriate areas.  Even though the two previous years have now passed, the funding that was not used then can be front-loaded for 2008 and 2009.  That is what we are about.  If we as a committee cannot deliver upon that we should not come back to this room for further meetings.  We are putting it as starkly as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The Minister of State is the Taoiseach's constituency colleague.  Can I take it that he has the Taoiseach's imprimatur, that the moneys which were not spent despite being allocated by the Taoiseach as Minister for Finance in 2006, 2007 and to date in 2008 will now be front loaded and that the Minister of State's comments as chairman of the joint committee will stand up so that front line staff in palliative care and mental health can receive the moneys allocated for a legitimate purpose which is of importance and great sensitivity to many families?  Nothing is as frustrating as seeing Ministers announce money for a certain purpose only to find it has disappeared into a black hole somewhere within the HSE.  Can I get a commitment from the Taoiseach that the words of the former chairman of the joint committee will be implemented to ensure these front line staff provide the service to which they legitimately aspire?</p>

          <p eId="para_108">Given the Taoiseach's increasingly busy schedule, he probably does not get much time for pushing shopping trolleys around the supermarkets in Tullamore, but I want to raise with him the problem of rising prices. I will focus on two aspects in particular, the first of which is the rip-off of Irish consumers by British retailers with shops located in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Last weekend, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> carried a survey — one of a series published in recent times — which shows that the prices charged in the Irish branches of British retail outlets are up to 50% higher than those charged in their UK shops.  The survey provided details in respect of a number of British retailers — Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer, Argos, Laura Ashley etc. — that have branches in Ireland.  These higher prices are being charged despite the fact that the euro has strengthened against sterling.  The euro is now worth 80p sterling.  At one stage, it was valued below 60p sterling.  In such circumstances, one would have expected that the prices charged in the Irish branches of British retail outlets would have fallen.  Instead, they are much higher than those charged in the UK.  For example, a leading brand of detergent costs the equivalent of €12.50 in a British branch of Tesco while it costs €18.89 in an Irish branch.  In the case of Marks &amp; Spencer, a pair of shoes priced at the equivalent of €44 at a British branch costs €55 euro at its Irish branches.  The prices charged by Argos at its Irish branches in respect of electrical items are 20% higher than those it charges in the UK.  What is happening in respect of this aspect of pricing is inexplicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The second matter to which I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention — the position in this regard is also inexplicable — is the price of diesel.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">Diesel used to cost less than petrol.  However, the price of diesel is increasing each day.  On my way to the Dáil, I noticed one petrol station at which diesel is priced at €1.39 per litre.  No one can explain why the price of diesel has shot ahead of that of petrol or why it is continuing to rise.  The only explanation appears to be that the oil companies, anticipating a shift by motorists to diesel cars and other diesel-powered vehicles as a result of environmental concerns, etc., are taking the opportunity to hike up the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Difficulties relating to pricing affect people on a daily basis.  The National Consumer Agency was established a couple of years ago but it does not appear to be doing anything about these difficulties.  What action does the Government intend to take to address the rise in prices, which is inexplicable and for which there is no justification?  What does the Taoiseach intend to do to encourage the National Consumer Agency, which was established by the Oireachtas, to act more effectively in the interests of consumers?</p>

          <p eId="para_118">It is intended to discuss these matters with the chief executive of the National Consumer Agency.  The question of profiteering in respect of imports as a result of the difference in the currency exchange rate is a matter for the National Consumer Agency, the Competition Authority and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I am glad the rate of inflation decreased in the past month.  However, it still stands at 4.3%.  The basket of food items is an important factor in the computation of the consumer price index.  I acknowledge that there has been an increase in food prices as a result of a number of international factors which are indicative of a change in the food security situation worldwide.  Deputy Sherlock stated last week that the latter is an issue for consideration for debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">I take the point that the National Consumer Agency highlighted these matters in the first instance.  It is the responsibility of the agency to protect consumer interests.  The Tánaiste will pursue with the agency's chief executive the further policy issues that can be articulated or implemented to assist in resolving this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_121">That will not provide much comfort to the people obliged to pay these prices.  I refer, in particular, to those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, who are being affected by rising food prices.  The price of a loaf of bread is 20% higher than it was at this time last year and the price of a litre of milk increased by 30% in the same period.  Action is required in respect of this matter.  It is not good enough to state that a discussion will take place between the Tánaiste and the chief executive of the National Consumer Agency in which they will bemoan what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">In the past couple of years, the Government stood down the groceries order and stated that increased competition would lead to a reduction in prices.  However, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the abolition of the groceries order, Tesco — the chief executive of which pays himself £10 million sterling per annum — is charging up to 50% more for goods in Ireland than it does at its UK branches.  The National Consumer Agency may, as the Taoiseach stated, have highlighted some of what is happening.  However, it does not appear to have taken direct action to protect consumers from the rip-off prices being charged by some retail outlets.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">If the rip offs being visited upon consumers are not curtailed by the retailers responsible for them, the Government will be obliged to take action to remedy the situation.  In light of the fact that the euro is strengthening against sterling, prices here should be falling and people should be reaping the benefits.  Irish businesses that export their products are feeling the squeeze as a result of the change in the relationship between the euro and sterling.  However, consumers are not enjoying the benefits of that change.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">In certain shops, one can find items which are priced in sterling — I understand this practice is not legal — but the retailer will not allow one to purchase them in that currency.  I met a shopper this morning who informed me that she requested to pay the sterling exchange rate for a particular item.  However, the retailer insisted on charging her the higher euro price.  This type of behaviour cannot be allowed to stand and people cannot continue to be ripped off in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">In his earlier reply, the Taoiseach failed to address my point in respect of the price of diesel.  Why are motorists and hauliers obliged to pay so much more for diesel than used to be the case?  What is happening in this regard?  It appears the oil companies are engaged in some kind of cartel activity in order to hike up the price of diesel and rip off motorists and hauliers.  The latter will have consequences down the line for jobs and businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">The price of oil and diesel is a matter that must be addressed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the relevant agencies.  There is a need to ensure that there is transparency as regards pricing arrangements.  Oil prices have doubled in the past 12 months, from $62 to $126 per barrel.  That sort of variation depends on the availability of oil and the stocks that are already in place.  Without prior notice, I do not have details of the latter to hand this morning.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">The code of conduct for office holders was drawn up by the Government pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, and it was published in July 2003.  Deputies will be aware that the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 provides for changes to the ethics framework.  A review of the code will be carried out in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission after that Bill has been enacted.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_116">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_139">That is virtually the same answer given by the Taoiseach's predecessor last October.  The Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill has still not been dealt with in this House and the Bill, in any event, deals with somewhat different matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">I will ask the Taoiseach about three particular aspects of this issue.  In the programme for Government, there is a commitment that an "acceptable buffer period" will be put in place before civil servants or local government officials can take up employment in related areas of the private sector.  What will be done about that commitment in the programme for Government?  If that buffer period is to be put in place in respect of civil servants and local government officials, will the same apply to office holders?  I am conscious, for example, that a former Minister of State, who served in the last Administration, went directly from a Department in which he had responsibility for property and construction matters to a lobby organisation representing the construction industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">In respect of appointments to State bodies, in the existing code there is a commitment that appointments made by Government to State bodies would be based on merit, taking into account the skills, qualifications and experience of the person to be appointed.  I ask the Taoiseach how that sits with his predecessor's acknowledgement that some appointments made to State bodies by his Administration were made on the basis that they were friends?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_117">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_142">On the latter matter, the then Taoiseach was making the point that whereas these people had competence to go on these State boards, they were also people he knew.  In many cases when I am looking for suitable people for appointment, there are some people whom I never met before who are recommended to me and others whom I know or meet in the course of my duties may impress me and may have a role to play so if they were available they could be appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">That one knows or does not know somebody is not the issue, the issue is competence to serve on a board.  The fact that one is friendly with somebody should not be a disbarment and by the same token it should not be — this was not suggested — the only criterion involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The people who have served on these boards are competent to do so.  That issue has been somewhat flogged to death at this stage in terms of trying to misrepresent what the position was and is.  That applies to successive Governments.  I never commented adversely on anybody who made an appointment on the basis they knew someone.  The only time I would ever comment is on the basis of whether I felt the person was competent to do the job.  That certainly was not the criteria suggested as being out of order today.  If one knows somebody now, there is apparently a problem.  It is not a fair comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">On the codes of conduct, there is currently an arrangement where a retiring public official would get clearance in terms of ensuring a buffer period before taking up a subsequent appointment.  All people involved would act ethically and in a proper and appropriate way.  The commitment in the programme for Government will be implemented in due course and it is a question of finding a period of time to simply allay any semblance of public concern, which I do not believe is well grounded anyway under present arrangements.  The motivation behind that issue is to provide further reassurance.  It can be achieved in due course in this Administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">I have found it to be the case that local government officials or civil servants who have subsequently taken up appointments have done so mindful of their previous public duties.  I have total confidence that at no stage would they allow a conflict of interest to arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">With regard to the Minister of State mentioned by the Deputy, he was quite entitled to take up that appointment and I am aware of no suggestion of any impropriety on his part in taking it up.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_148">The Taoiseach is implying I made statements I did not make.  I never claimed that somebody would be disbarred from appointment to a State body because the person happened to know the Minister or the Taoiseach of the day.  I was seeking to explore whether the appointments would be made on the basis of merit rather than just purely on the "who you know" principle.  I am very glad to hear the Taoiseach stating that the principle he intends to apply in appointments he will make and, presumably, those of his Ministers, will be on the basis of ability, suitability and skills which can be brought to the job.  I look forward to assessing all future appointments on the basis of those criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_171">Yes.  Some months would be a fair assessment as people should not be denied the opportunity to make a livelihood having retired and given loyal service to the State.  It is not appropriate for us to suggest, for some reason, a contamination-free zone.  It is about simply providing some reassurance that there is a time period in which people can reorganise their lives and move on to something else.  I am aware that most civil servants instinctively seek the views of their colleagues, on an informal basis, when they are approached to join the board of a company.  This measure will formalise the arrangements and methodologies which, while not in place on a <i>de facto</i> basis, are used in some cases.  During my period of service, I have come across just a couple of cases in which inquiries have had to be made to ascertain what would help to avoid any semblance of controversy when a person was being appointed.  I do not think one should be disbarred from taking up a position for any more than some months.  It may not be possible to enforce a law setting out the areas of activity to which somebody who has retired from service may contribute, whether for monetary compensation or in a voluntary capacity.  I do not think it would be practical.  We need to ensure that people cannot move into such positions immediately or within a week or two.</p>

            <p eId="para_174">What is the current position with regard to the thresholds that are in place to govern the shareholdings that members of the Government and Ministers of State may hold in private companies?  I understand that those thresholds, with the thresholds for gifts, were changed recently.  Will the Taoiseach update the House on the new levels?  The Standards in Public Office Commission, which is responsible for overseeing compliance with the ethics legislation, has asked to be allowed to conduct its own investigations, but that request has been refused by the Taoiseach.  Does he intend to revise that decision?  Is that still the position?  The Standards in Public Office Commission has also called for the introduction of clear standards of behaviour for office holders and civil servants.  The standards which are in place in Britain are known as the "seven principles of public life".  I cannot outline the seven principles for the Taoiseach.  Has consideration been given to the request made by the Standards in Public Office Commission?  Does the Government intend to set out clear guidelines for the patterns of behaviour of Ministers and Ministers of State?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_145">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_175">The code of conduct for office holders, which is the subject of Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, covers the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The Standards in Public Office Commission generally oversees the implementation of the ethics Acts.  It can take the code of conduct for office holders into account when investigating the activities of office holders.  That is where it comes into play.  It would not make sense to review the code of conduct in advance of the enactment of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, which will amend the ethics framework.  The code of conduct will have to be amended to take account of that legislation after it has been enacted.  This country's first ethics legislation, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, is not relevant to actions carried out before 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">The legislation in respect of which Deputy Kenny is seeking clarification will do three things.  First, it will require office holders and Members of the Oireachtas to seek the opinion of the Standards in Public Office Commission before they accept gifts or loans from friends for personal reasons which are, in aggregate, worth more than €2,000 in a calendar year.  If the acceptance of the gift or loan is to be permitted, the commission will have to form the opinion, and abide by that opinion, that it will not materially influence the recipient in the performance of his or her duties and functions.  Members will be required to seek an opinion from the Standards in Public Office Commission before they receive, or acknowledge the receipt of, a gift or loan that is worth more than €2,000 from a friend.</p>
            <p eId="para_177">Second, the legislation will increase the threshold above which a gift to an office holder must be surrendered to the State, unless it is a political donation, a gift given by virtue of another office or a gift from a friend or relative for personal reasons only.  The threshold, which is set at €650, will be increased to €2,000.  Third, the legislation will increase the threshold for the disclosure of registrable interests from €650 to €2,000.  The threshold for income from a trade or profession will be increased from €2,600 to €5,000.  The threshold for a shareholding or an interest in land will increase from €13,000 to €20,000.  The threshold for a contract to provide goods or services to the public service will increase from €6,500 to €10,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_178">The Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann and the Committee on Members' Interests of Seanad Éireann were consulted about the key provisions of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, including all the revised thresholds, in spring of last year.  Both committees replied in March 2007.  The Seanad committee was in agreement with the proposed changes.  The Dáil committee welcomed the proposals as it considered that they would further strengthen the accountability of Members of the Oireachtas to the public in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities.  The Whips, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, will decide when the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 will be considered by the House.  Those are the issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">I will comment on the new €2,000 requirement.  Members will be required to consult the Standards in Public Office Commission before they accept gifts or loans for personal reasons.  The €2,000 figure has been decided on as part of an attempt to strike a balance.  The figure needs to be small enough to be meaningful as an ethics requirement, but it also needs to be big enough to ensure that Members of the Oireachtas and office holders do not have to spend time counting and valuing every ordinary gift they receive from friends and that the Standards in Public Office Commission does not have to deal with applications about relatively minor gifts.  I think the €2,000 figure represents a fair compromise between these two considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">We need to bear in mind that the thresholds have not been increased since they were first introduced in 1995.  I accept that minor adjustments were made in 2002, when these figures were converted into convenient euro amounts.  The thresholds have not been increased significantly in the 13 years since 1995.  The Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 will set the thresholds for some years to come.  It is a question of striking a balance without negating the basic intent of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">In its 2006 annual report, which was published in the summer of 2007, the Standards in Public Office Commission made various recommendations for changes to the ethics legislation.  It proposed that it be given the power to appoint an inquiry officer even if it has not received a complaint.  The commission already has the authority to take an initiative to launch an investigation into breaches of the ethics legislation when it considers it appropriate to do so.  There is a difference between appointing an inquiry officer and initiating an investigation.  At present, the commission can appoint an inquiry officer only when it has received a complaint.  Inquiry officers conduct interviews with those who make complaints and other relevant people, request documents, show the complaints to those who are the subject of complaints, detail the evidence to such people and take statements from them etc.  They do not make determinations on complaints — they are merely responsible for gathering evidence.  However, the commission can ask an inquiry officer for his or her opinion on whether there is enough <i>prima facie</i> evidence to sustain a complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">When I was Minister for Finance, I told the House that I did not intend to amend the law to enable the Standards in Public Office Commission to appoint an inquiry officer without first having received a complaint.  It is reasonable to require that a complaint be made to the commission before the inquiry process, which can have serious consequences for office holders and senior public servants, can be commenced.  Complaints about Members of the Oireachtas who are not office holders are matters for the relevant Committee on Members' Interests in the first instance.  Numerous categories of people, including members of the public and public representatives, are entitled to make a complaint against office holders and public servants to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  My attitude is that such complaints can have serious consequences for those who become the subject of inquiry, as I said.  I do not believe inquiries should be conducted if nobody has made a complaint.  That is fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Most of the other amendments to the ethics legislation suggested by the commission are technical.  One of them is already catered for in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  Another one is catered for in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, which was recently passed by the Dáil and is currently before the Seanad.  I indicated that the Government accepts the rest of the commission's technical proposals.  Amendments to cater for them will be circulated in advance of the Committee Stage debate on the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">I take it from the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Kenny that the Government intends to proceed with the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007.  When might it proceed, particularly in light of comments to the media yesterday by Deputy Cuffe who said that the Green Party would be looking for more transparency and a lowering of the threshold rather than an increase in the threshold in the two cases the Taoiseach mentioned, which is from €650 to €2,000 for a gift and the privacy limit for shareholdings is from €13,000 to €20,000?  Is the Taoiseach in a position to confirm whether there have been representations from the Green Party in this regard?  I note the Government Whip mentioned there had been no representations from the Green Party in respect of this.  In light of all the tribunals and the difficulties experienced by people in public life, does the Taoiseach not agree there is a public demand to reduce these thresholds and for more transparency and openness?  That is the direction in which we should be going rather than in the opposite direction.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_150">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_188">I do not agree we are going in the opposite direction.  We are very consistent in what we are trying to do.  We are trying to ensure we have arrangements that are reasonable and sensible and that do not require the commission to be involved in issues that would be regarded as being without problem.  At the same time we want to have a limit that requires that the issue be dealt with properly.  I do not accept that this is going in the opposite direction.  We are setting out thresholds for the future as a result of what we have learnt in the past 15 years.  The balance needs to be struck here.  We came up with a practical and pragmatic approach that meets the requirements of the legislation and ensures that Ministers, officeholders and others do not end up making a technical breach without realising it.  It is important that we get clarity on the thresholds and that these be fixed for future years also, which is fair enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The level of the thresholds has been a matter of Government decision.  Some Deputies may have spoken in a personal capacity or whatever, but the Government is very clear that these are the thresholds that will be applied.  These will be the proposals to be put to this House as they were put to the Upper House.  We believe as a Government united that this is the best way forward taking all the considerations into account.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_190">Regarding the buffer zone as it affects local authority officials, I understand the Taoiseach has not been on a local authority for a long time, if he ever was on one.  I was a member of a local authority for some time.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach realises why the timeframe needs to be more than a few months.  I have examples of this that I can give him.  A planning official may be involved in a variation proposal, a local area plan proposal or a development plan review, which naturally through its course takes approximately a year from variation to rezoning to LAP.  We cannot allow the poacher to turn gamekeeper whereby the planning official for a particular project might end up working as a consultant for one of the developers or landowners.  It is particularly important for planning officials that it is not a tokenistic few months.  It needs to be a reasonable time of at least a year and a half or two years.  Does the Taoiseach understand there is a particular issue regarding planning officials that might not be the case for Ministers of State, for example?</p>
            <p eId="para_191">What is the current code of conduct for Ministers who receive official gifts from representatives of other governments in their capacity as Ministers, in particular when those gifts come from regimes that violate human rights or are undemocratic?  Is there any particular code of conduct relating to the receipt of gifts by Ministers from dictators, torturers or murderers?</p>

            <p eId="para_193">On the first matter, I served on a local authority for eight years — I do not know how long the Deputy served on one.  My county never had a section 4, by the way.  Regarding avoiding conflicts of interest, it is a matter that needs fuller consideration when it comes to the implementation of the proposal.  I am not dismissing the possibility of variation of approach depending on the particular responsibility.  The purpose is to provide some reassurance.  When people leave the public service and move into a related area, I do not accept the suggestion that they can operate as if they were still <i>in loco</i> in the original place and are able to sort out matters from outside in a way that is inappropriate or unethical because that reflects on the ethical position of the new incumbent of the position that was vacated.  These decisions are taken quasi-judicially by city and county managers.  For planning decisions there are procedures and protocols, and means by which representations can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">We do not want to defeat a policy objective that results in public officials moving to the private sector and individuals moving from the private to the public sector.  The more interaction and cross-pollination there is, the better for creating a better awareness by everybody of their specific and distinct responsibilities.  By trying to deal with one perceived possible issue let us not end up closing off that objective which would also be a good one.  It is about striking a balance between various considerations.  I do not suggest that the consideration the Deputy makes is not one that needs to be put into the mix.  It does need to be put into the mix and it is a matter of judgment then.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">At the end of the day the question of ethical behaviour is the responsibility of the individual concerned anyway.  Once an official moves into the private sector and certain issues arise, it is open to the person concerned as to what would be regarded as the appropriate thing to do. Perhaps this would form part of the consideration of the buffer zone idea.  For example, such a person should not be part of that file in that office and should not engage precisely for the reason the Deputy has given.  There are ways and means of doing that without a legislative response.  It could be a code of conduct.  We need to think the matter through.  It is a fair point.  I do not dismiss it as there is substance to what he has to say, but we also need to be careful we do not end up throwing out the baby with the bath water.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">Regarding the gifts, I will check the protocol on that.  Unfortunately, I have not been a great recipient of those from even the most benign of regimes.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">As Deputy Varadkar said, it can arise that a county manager, director of planning or senior public servant is involved in a particular public project, retires and then starts to work for a tenderer for that project.  I understood that the idea of the buffer zone was to have a period of time to allow the kind of turnover that would take place in that kind of case.  I was surprised to hear that it is now considered to be some months in duration.  With whom has this matter been discussed since the programme for Government was written?  Have there been discussions with any of the associations representing senior public servants and bodies representing senior personnel at local government level, for example, to ascertain their views on what might be appropriate?</p>
            <p eId="para_200">I also raise the issue of the change in the limits for gifts and the various thresholds for what is to be declared under the standards in public office rules.  The original Ethics in Public Office Act contained a provision allowing the Minister to increase those thresholds in line with inflation.  I do not think anybody would argue with that, but it seems that what is proposed in the Bill is considerably in excess of inflation.  The threshold for interests from a remunerated trade or profession has increased from €2,600 to €5,000, shares increased from €13,000 to €20,000, land from €13,000 to €20,000 and gifts from €650 to €2,000.  They are significantly ahead of inflation.  Why is that being done, if the original idea was to keep it in line with inflation?  Why are the thresholds being increased significantly ahead of inflation?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_201">The reason is one is setting the thresholds not only for this year, but for years ahead.  We will not return to this matter every year.  It is a fair balance, taking all the considerations into account.  It is a judgment call.  One could say €1,500, €2,000 or €2,500.  The Government felt that was a fair balance taking into account all the considerations and in recognition that this would be the amount for some years hence as well.  I do not think it should be a matter of serious contention between us.  I have explained the considerations one is trying to take into account.  We want something that has efficacy and continued transparency but that is also sensible in the context of where the country is at currently and the future we face.  I do not expect everyone to agree with the amounts and amendments may be tabled to the contrary.  However, the motivation behind the change is to try to ensure we have thresholds that will serve us for some time to come as well as for the present.  It is 15 years since we last looked at those thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">Deputy Gilmore referred to months.  I am not aware of the details or whether any discussions have taken place on the matter but it is a good suggestion that we would ask the County and City Managers' Association and the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants for their views as they could be helpful to us in finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> that is sensible for everybody.  I do not think there is any reticence or refusal on anyone’s part to try to bring in something that would be helpful in ensuring that we do not allow the idea to arise that people are engaged in haphazardly moving from one sector to another in a way that does not take cognisance of the importance of upholding public confidence.  This is all about upholding public confidence in the duties of office holders or senior civil holders as they move from one career to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The question of ethical behaviour is one for individuals themselves.  If one were moving, one would understand or should know the potential conflicts involved.  It is up to each individual to ensure he or she does not engage in those files that could be sensitive.  Perhaps it might be helpful to have a legislative or code of conduct response to consultations with the various bodies in terms of coming up with arrangements that are regarded as sensible that would meet the requirements of the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_204">I agree that the upholding of public confidence is absolutely imperative.  Does the code of conduct extend to Ministers and Ministers of State?  The Garda Síochána is the only buffer zone between the citizen and the criminal and in many ways it has come in for a lot of stick.  The Morris tribunal revelations from Donegal did not do the force any good.  I agree public confidence should be upheld.  Does the code of conduct extend to Ministers of State?  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, let fly at the Garda and said it was not able to do its job and that it was not sufficiently experienced.  Does it comply with code of conduct behaviour for office holders to publicly attack the only body we have to protect the ordinary citizen from the criminal?  Does the Taoiseach agree with that, or does he hold the view that a Minister of State should practice a code of conduct that does not run down the upholding of public confidence in, for example, the Garda, which is something we all have to deal with?  If any Minister has a difficulty in that regard, he could bring it to the attention of either the Garda Commissioner or directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform instead of broadcasting it on the public airwaves and adding to a high degree of cynicism that exists in many quarters about the only force we have to protect the ordinary citizen from criminal activities and the threat and the consequences of criminality.</p>

It is important to be careful that in reflecting the frustrations of families who find themselves in the terrible situation involving missing persons and not knowing where they are — I have one family in my own constituency in mind in that respect  — that it is not suggested that the Garda is not making every effort to sort out the problem.  I accept totally that it is doing so.  Sometimes reflecting the frustrations of families can indicate something to the contrary, which was not the intention of the Minister of State.  I would ask that this be accepted.  I know that the Commissioner accepts there was no such intention on the Minister of State's part.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_164">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_215">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">There are no plans for an official commemoration of the foundation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, IRB, on its 150th anniversary.  I acknowledge the historical significance of the IRB and the influential role of the organisation in the progress towards independence.  However, it is not possible for every anniversary to be officially commemorated.  The activities of the IRB and its influence on historic events will be a significant element in the centenary commemorations in the years towards 2016.  I would welcome initiatives from colleges and academic institutions on this theme during the anniversary year.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">An interdepartmental collaboration, led by my Department, is preparing a continuation of the commemoration of the Flight of the Earls on its 400th anniversary, reflecting their progress from Louvain to Rome.  Academic and cultural programmes have been developed in co-operation with the embassies of Ireland in Belgium, Strasbourg, Berne and Rome, which I am confident will bring to attention this very significant part of Ireland's historical engagement in Europe.  Funding for that commemorative activity is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">My Department was involved as usual in the annual commemoration of the Easter Rising at the GPO on 23 March and will be involved in the national day of commemoration at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on 13 July next.  It will also assist with the arrangements for other events.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">Previous discussion in the House contemplated the inauguration of an annual Famine memorial day and there was a growing consensus on that between the parties.  Official consideration was undertaken about how that might be explored further.  The assessment had regard both to the specific issues of food security and the general heritage arising through emigration and cultural loss.  Several possibilities were identified, some of which could be implemented.  We must decide the most appropriate arrangements for such a commemoration.  My colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, has arranged a commemorative event in Dublin for this Sunday, 25 May 2008 to complement a community event in Dublin marking the great Famine.</p>
            <p eId="para_220">Regarding the anniversary of the First Dáil, I recall that the 75th anniversary was marked by a special commemoration.  I feel that annual commemoration in the normal course of that first meeting would be more appropriately a matter for the Oireachtas in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_222">My supplementary relates to the meeting of the First Dáil.  The 90th anniversary of that event will take place next January.  To a large extent that event has been overshadowed.  Given its significance — it was the first convening of democratically elected representatives of the people to establish the State — will special attention be given to the commemoration of the 90th anniversary next January and, in particular, to promulgating the Democratic Programme of that First Dáil, a document that has been overlooked to a large extent in the passage of time in Irish history?</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_223">We have two events commemorating 1916, the Arbour Hill and O'Connell Street events.  Is it intended to continue with both of them and in what format?  I am aware an internal committee of the Oireachtas is examining the question of the centenary of the 1916 uprising.  Is it intended to continue with the events at Arbour Hill and O'Connell Street in their current form or in some amended form?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_168">
            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_224">Is the Taoiseach aware that the all-party committee established to prepare for the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016 has not met during the period of this Dáil?  Will he arrange a meeting of that committee to be held because there is a significant number of events worthy of commemoration, both for the remainder of this year and in 2009.  Some of them have been alluded to but I am disappointed to hear the Irish Republican Brotherhood centenary will not be commemorated because it played a major role in 1916 in preparing and drilling for that event and procuring arms for the armed rebellion against British occupation in this country.  The Taoiseach might pass on my views to the committee for consideration rather than simply dismiss it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_225">In the context of the two national monuments designated last year — the Minister, Deputy Roche, designated 14 to 17 Moore Street and the former Taoiseach the GPO — and the considerable amount of physical work as well as planning required to prepare those sites for the commemoration of the centenary in 2016, will the Taoiseach indicate the steps taken to date or the plans in place?  Only eight years remain until the commemoration.  Has the Government any plans to properly develop those two national monuments in the context of 2016?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_170">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_226">On the first point raised by Deputy Gilmore, as I said it is a matter for the Oireachtas.  As it was a Dáil event the Oireachtas should organise it and I would welcome the commemorating of the 90th anniversary of the First Dáil.  I recall the 75th anniversary which, if my recollection serves me right, was held in the Mansion House.  I believe that is a matter for the Oireachtas to arrange.  It is a matter for the Deputies but they will have the support of Government and the Oireachtas in determining the best way of commemorating the 90th anniversary of that very important event.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">Regarding Deputy Kenny's question, the current arrangements are that we commemorate at the GPO and at Arbour Hill.  I do not know of any reason we should change that.  We should continue both events.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Regarding Deputy Morgan's question, the 150th anniversary of the founding of the IRB by James Stephens and others is a matter that will be part of the centenary events related to 2016.  I am not dismissing anything.  I would welcome initiatives from colleges and academic institutions on this theme during the anniversary year and indeed in the interim.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">Regarding Deputy Costello's question, I will ask for a report from the Office of Public Works on its plans.  In my view the centenary of 2016 should be commemorated properly and appropriately and the buildings where so much took place should be appropriately prepared.  I will have to get a report and talk to the Deputy subsequently about the matter.</p>

I am delighted the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach are in the Chamber to hear this.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of local and national importance, that is, the unbelievable bombshell that despite the fact the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, following the signing the St. Andrews Agreement, gave a public commitment to the funding of a dual carriageway from Derry city and Donegal through Tyrone and Monaghan to Dublin, it has now been renegued on by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who has advised the Good Friday Agreement committee that although the Irish Government would provide funding for a dual carriageway from Derry to the Border, it will be only a single carriageway from there to Clontibret.  That is an extraordinary turnaround but, more importantly, if allowed to happen will create chaos and no doubt lead to serious accidents.  I urge that a debate be allowed.</p>

The school in my constituency will lose one teacher next year because it is one student short of the number required in 2007.

          <p eId="para_460">The Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad with, it is fair to say, support from across the board for the intent of the legislation, if not for every last detail.  The Seanad debate resulted in a number of amendments to the Bill as initiated, several of which were due to the intervention of the Opposition, which I believe have resulted in improvements to the relevant provisions.  I look forward to the debate in this House and I am prepared to listen to any reasonable suggestions for further improvements to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The greater Dublin area, GDA, is the most densely populated and traffic-congested region within the State.  It comprises seven local authorities, namely Dublin city, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, south Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  It has an area of just under 7,000 sq. km and in 2006 had a population of 1.66 million people or almost 40% of the State's total population.  This represents an increase of more than a quarter of a million people in the ten years from 1996 to 2006.  During the same period, the number of people travelling to work each day in the area also increased by a quarter of a million or by more than 50%.  The people of this area and its business community require a transport system that is integrated, efficient, effective and sustainable.  The provision of such a system is the mandate the Government intends to give to the Dublin transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The new authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the greater Dublin area, subject to direction by the Government in respect of significant policy issues.  I will outline the main policy priorities for the authority.  It will work with the regional and local authorities to ensure a better alignment of transport and land use planning processes.  It will be charged with ensuring the effective integration of public transport infrastructure and services.  It will be responsible for the timely and cost-effective implementation of the public transport infrastructure projects for the greater Dublin area in the ten-year Transport 21 capital investment framework.  It will procure the provision of public transport services in a manner that optimises the benefits arising from the almost doubling of capacity on the public transport system under Transport 21.  Finally, but not least, it will be asked to work towards the achievement of a sustainable transport system for the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">In order to deliver effectively on such policy objectives, the authority will be given a wide range of functions covering strategic transport planning, the procurement of public transport infrastructure and services, the promotion of cycling and walking, integration and traffic and demand management.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The authority will draw up a strategic framework for the delivery of infrastructure and services in a strategic transport plan covering a 12 to 20-year period, much as did the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy, A Platform for Change.  To ensure this plan is put into action, the authority will produce six-yearly integrated implementation plans focusing on the projects and services to be introduced during the period of each plan and on how the integration of such projects and services with each other and with existing services is to be achieved.  Both the strategic transport plan and the implementation plan will be subject to a wide-ranging consultation process.  Each plan will be subject to ministerial approval as part of a wide range of measures to ensure the authority will be properly accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The authority will procure public transport services, which are subject to public service obligations, in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of EU law.  This will enable the authority to ensure the integration of services and will provide a new framework to hold service providers to account for the quality of services provided to the public.  It will regulate public transport fares and will have powers to ensure the delivery of integrated ticketing and fares and public transport information schemes.  It will promote cycling and walking as a sustainable alternative to motorised transport.  The work of the authority in this regard will take into account the Government's action plan on sustainable travel and transport, which will be published later this year, and, in particular, the national cycling plan on which the Department is working at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The authority will also prepare a strategic traffic management plan for the region to ensure a consistent approach across all local authority areas, including during construction works for major infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">One of the key drivers in preparing this legislation was the need to more closely align transport and land use planning in the GDA.  Achieving greater integration of transport and land use planning will be central to the success of the authority in carrying out its mandate.  The Minister worked closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his officials on drafting the relevant provisions in the Bill.  The objective was to ensure a more sustainable and integrated approach to land use and transport in the greater Dublin area through maximising consistency between regional planning guidelines, local authority development plans and local area plans, and the authority's transport strategy.  That can only be achieved if a balance is struck that ensures transport considerations are fully addressed as part of land use planning while respecting the existing democratic accountability of the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The proposals seek to give an equitable share of responsibilities to the regional and local planning authorities on the one hand, to participate in the development of the transport strategy and implementation plan, and to the DTA, on the other hand, to take an active part in the formulation of the regional, county and local planning processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">A series of technical amendments are proposed to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to allow the Dublin transport authority make key inputs at every stage of the preparation and review of regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, thereby ensuring that they are closely aligned with the authority's transport strategy.  A balancing provision allows the regional authorities to influence the content of the authority's transport strategy to make sure that it is consistent with the regional planning guidelines.  Similar arrangements will apply to ensure local authority development plans and local area plans will be consistent with the authority's strategic transport plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Additional powers will also be given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to intervene, if required, to ensure that regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans are consistent with the transport strategy prepared for the greater Dublin area by the Dublin transport authority.  A similar power is given to the Minister for Transport to intervene, if required, to ensure that the transport strategy is consistent with regional planning policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Additionally, developers of classes of development prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government after consultation with the authority, will be required to submit transport impact assessments as part of the planning process.  Such impact assessments will require developers to demonstrate how their proposals are consistent with the authority's transport strategy.  Planning authorities will be required to satisfy themselves that is the case before granting permission.  The Bill also introduces a new, non-compensatable reason for the refusal of planning permission, namely that the proposed development would not be consistent with the authority's transport strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">These proposals will provide workable and effective arrangements to better integrate transport and land use planning to ensure the full benefits of a more accessible city and hinterland envisioned under Transport 21 are realised for people living and working in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">A major objective of this legislation is the delivery of an integrated transport network.  This will be achieved in a number of ways.  The authority will have overall responsibility for procuring public transport services and will be able to use its detailed powers in this area to ensure that bus, rail, metro and Luas services are properly integrated in the future.  The authority will implement a single public transport brand, something akin to the Transport for London brand springs to mind, but it will be left to the authority to decide the optimal branding and how it should be introduced.  The authority will take over direct responsibility for the introduction of integrated ticketing, building on the work already undertaken by the Railway Procurement Agency and overseen by the integrated ticketing project board.  The authority will also have responsibility for introducing an integrated fares system and the development of an integrated information system, providing a single, integrated source of travel planning information for public transport users.  Its infrastructure powers will enable it to ensure the delivery of public transport interchange and park and ride facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The Government is committed to a radical improvement of public transport services in the GDA.  Moreover, it is wholeheartedly committed to obtaining the best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from the significant subvention being provided by the Exchequer for public transport services in the GDA.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The Bill provides for the use of performance-based public service contracts for bus and rail public transport services in the greater Dublin area.  The contracts will set out clearly the services being provided and the payments to support those services.  These provisions are in line with the new regime introduced under the EU regulation on public service obligations in the transport sector, which becomes mandatory from next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The programme for Government includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 to facilitate the optimum provision of services.  It is the Minister's intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  The new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU regulation.  In the meantime, applications for new bus licences and notifications from State bus operators will continue to be processed under the licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the notification system under the Transport Act 1958.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The Bill includes strong provisions, modelled on the powers that have been so successfully used by the National Roads Authority, NRA, regarding the provision of public transport infrastructure.  The powers of the authority set out in the legislation can be summarised as follows.  The authority will have responsibility for the allocation of Exchequer funds for public transport infrastructure projects in the GDA.  However, as is the case with the NRA, the DTA will act in accordance with the investment priorities set out by Government in Transport 21 and the national development plan.  The authority will be required to endeavour to deliver public transport infrastructure projects through existing agencies in the first instance.  However, if it considers it more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical to do so, it can deliver a project itself.  The authority can issue a direction to a transport agency requiring it to deliver or take a particular action in delivering a project.  Should the transport agency refuse, the DTA can step in and take over the project itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Following his appointment as Minister for Transport in June 2007, Deputy Noel Dempsey decided to initiate a review of the draft legislation having regard to the commitments in the agreed programme for Government and also the length of time that had passed since the Dublin transport authority establishment team had completed its report.  One of that report's recommendations was that the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, be absorbed into the new authority.  In the intervening period the RPA has made major progress on the important projects assigned to it under Transport 21, particularly the procurement of metro north.  In the circumstances the Minister became concerned that the absorption of the RPA by the authority could jeopardise the ongoing public private partnership procurement process in respect of metro north, which is at a critical and sensitive juncture — tender documents were issued to the four bidding consortia just last week.  For that reason, it has been decided to leave the RPA outside the authority.  The benefits of providing organisational continuity in respect of the metro north procurement process far outweigh any other benefits that could have accrued from pursuing other options regarding the relationship between the RPA and the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">While mentioning the metro north project, I wish to point out an amendment to the Bill that was introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad regarding St. Stephen's Green.  The provision of metro north, as well as the DART interconnector, will have an impact on St. Stephen's Green.  Section 15 of the Saint Stephen's Green (Dublin) Act 1877 requires that the green shall be maintained as a park for the recreation of the public and for no other purpose.  The advice of the Attorney General was that a provision was required to overcome this restriction and facilitate the provision of the railways concerned.  Consequently, section 114 of the Bill provides powers for the transport agencies to carry out surveys and inspections in advance of railway works, to carry out the works authorised by a railway order and, in the longer term, to operate a railway under St. Stephen's Green.  The provision was drafted in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has statutory responsibility for the green, and care has been taken to ensure that the Minister's powers of consent under the National Monuments Acts with regard to the green remain unaffected.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Irish Rail and the RPA have worked closely together in designing the stations for both the interconnector and the metro north within the constraints agreed with the Office of Public Works and in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Dublin City Council and other key stakeholders.  In addition, Dublin City Council is developing a traffic management strategy to minimise the disruption caused to traffic by works at St. Stephen's Green.  To protect the sensitive heritage and environmental aspects of this area, specialists including conservation architects, archaeologists and arboriculturists are currently being taken on by the RPA to advise on these significant matters.  Before any work is carried out, detailed surveys, reports and photographic records will be commissioned and agreed with the OPW.  A detailed landscaping plan to reinstate the green will also be agreed with the OPW.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Mr. Tom Mulcahy has been appointed chairperson of the interim Dublin Transport Authority and will relinquish his position as chairperson of the Railway Procurement Agency in due course.  Additional members will be appointed shortly to the interim authority.  Its remit will be to prepare the ground for the establishment of the new authority.  A competition to find a suitable chief executive designate will be undertaken.  Once the chief executive designate is in place, the interim authority will be able to consider the staffing and financial requirements of the authority, initiate the recruitment of staff, source office accommodation and put in place the necessary support systems with a view to ensuring the authority is in a position to start work straight away when established.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  As this is a lengthy Bill, I will highlight only the main provisions of each part.  Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters and concerns certain standard legislative provisions such as definitions and commencement provisions.  Part 2 concerns the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority and the governance arrangements under which it will operate.  Chapter 1 of Part 2 concerns arrangements for the establishment of the authority.  Sections 10 and 11 set out the general objectives to be pursued by the authority and its principal functions.  To highlight the importance of cycling and walking in the wider transport picture, an additional function of promoting increased recourse to cycling and walking was added to the authority's functions by amendment in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Under section 12, the authority is required to prepare a transport strategy identifying the strategic transport requirements for the greater Dublin area over a 12 to 20 year timeframe.  The authority will inherit the work currently being undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office on the development of a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area for the period 2010-30 to succeed A Platform for Change.  A public consultation on the development of that strategy was initiated last Monday.  The authority is required under section 13 to prepare a six-year integrated implementation plan setting out the priorities, actions and objectives of the authority with regard to the provision of public transport infrastructure and services.  This plan is designed to translate strategy into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Chapter 2 of Part 2 sets out the structure and governance arrangements of the authority.  Under section 14, the authority will comprise ten members appointed by the Minister, three of whom will be executive directors — the chief executive officer and two senior managers.  The Dublin City Manager will be appointed in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity.  The remaining six non-executive part-time members must be people with relevant experience.  The report of the establishment team recommended the use of an independent nomination panel to recommend to the Minister persons for appointment to the authority.  However, the Minister is firmly of the view that given the large amount of taxpayers’ money being allocated to the authority, there should be strong accountability by the authority to the Minister of the day and to Government and that such accountability is best achieved by direct selection and appointment of the board by the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">The authority will be charged with carrying out all of the DTA's statutory functions.  Section 17 provides for the appointment by the Minister of a 13-member advisory council which will scrutinise the work of the authority.  Membership of the advisory council will comprise the Dublin City Manager, two county managers from the GDA or officers nominated by them, four elected members of the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities, a member of the Garda Síochána and four ordinary members nominated by representative organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Chapter 2 of Part 2 incorporates important provisions concerning the duty of the authority to implement Government policy and its accountability to the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas.  The Minister will have the power to issue policy directions and guidelines to the authority regarding any of its functions.  Compliance with policy directions will be mandatory.  In addition, under section 41 there is a statutory obligation on the chairperson and chief executive to appear before Oireachtas committees.  The authority's accounts will be subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, following which an annual report must be submitted to the Minister.  In addition to moneys granted to the authority through the Department of Transport, it will also be permitted to borrow up to an aggregate limit of €1 billion and those borrowings may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance subject to appropriate terms and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Section 40 of the Bill contains standard provisions precluding Members of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament from becoming members of the authority.  As originally drafted, this exclusion also applied to local authority members.  Following debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad, however, the provisions regarding non-eligibility of local authority members were removed.  As Deputies are aware, a Green Paper on local government has been published, in respect of which a consultation process is underway.  One of the proposals put forward for consideration is the creation of the position of a directly elected regional mayor for Dublin, who would also become the chairperson of the DTA.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hopes to finalise work on a White Paper by the end of the year after considering the views expressed during consultation.  We will work closely with him to give effect to Government policy as set out in the White Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Part 3 comprises six chapters dealing with transport infrastructure and services.  Chapter 1 sets out the functions of the authority with regard to the provision of public transport infrastructure.  It is being given responsibility for the procurement of public transport infrastructure.  However, in the normal course of events the authority will procure infrastructure through the existing statutory agencies — Irish Rail for suburban rail and the Railway Procurement Agency for light rail and metro.  The authority will also allocate capital funding to these bodies or agencies.  If the authority considers it necessary, however, it can step in and take over projects itself.  Its powers in this regard have been modelled on those of the NRA with regard to road projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Chapter 2 establishes a comprehensive framework that will give the authority the power to secure the provision of public passenger transport services through the use of public transport service contracts.  Procurement will be carried out by the authority's entering into public transport service contracts, the general framework for which is set out in sections 48, 49 and 50.  In the case of public bus and rail passenger services, as distinct from metro and light rail services, contracts will only be entered into where there is a public service obligation, PSO, identified by the authority.  Such contracts must comply with EU law, particularly EU Regulation 1370/2007, which establishes a new framework for PSO contracts for bus and rail passenger services and comes into effect from 3 December 2009.  This chapter has been prepared so that it is in line with the regulation.  The Office of the Attorney General has been directly involved in the preparation of the chapter to ensure we are in full compliance with our EU obligations, particularly in the area of State aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The specific structure adopted in respect of the making of direct award contracts with the CIE companies, which is set out in section 52, has been prepared with particular reference to the regulation.  The section establishes the basis for the continued provision of current bus services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in the greater Dublin area and for the ongoing operation by Irish Rail of rail services in the area.  The two bus companies are being granted exclusive rights to continue providing their current services, subject to the grant of licences for commercial services to private bus operators under the Road Transport Act 1932.  The authority will enter into direct award contracts with the companies in respect of those services.  The initial direct award contracts provided for under this section will last five years in the case of the public bus passenger services and ten years for rail passenger services.  Subsequent direct award contracts can be made and the authority is being given powers to review the contracts within their allotted life span.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In the case of public bus passenger services, the chapter provides support for the continued provision of the subvented services being provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann in the greater Dublin area in the first instance.  It also provides that any growth in the market for subvented services will be addressed by way of public service contracts that will be granted following open tendering, allowing Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann and private operators to tender for the operation of those services.  We will address the many other sections in due time.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The establishment of the new authority will streamline and strengthen the decision-making process in respect of the planning and provision of sustainable and integrated transport services and infrastructure in the greater Dublin area.  The strengthening of the interaction between land use planning and transport will further assist in ensuring the sustainable growth of the area and will lead to an enhanced quality of life for all who live and work therein.  The new authority will have a clear mandate and the necessary powers to deliver on it, but it will be fully accountable to the Minister for Transport and the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_496">Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading due to the severe lack of democratic accountability procedures inherent in the Bill in respect of the operation of the proposed Dublin Transport Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">According to the briefing documents of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, the Bill was ready for publication in April 2007, but it has taken one year for the Bill to appear before the House in its new format.  Since the Minister took so long to make up his mind — the original date set for this debate was tomorrow and, last week, I was satisfied with the set dates of Wednesday and Thursday — his absence is unacceptable.  I acknowledge his commitment to North-South co-operation, but it is an insult to the House that the Minister is not present given the importance of this Bill, which will transform the administration of transport in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Minister is not new to the idea of a Dublin transport authority.  The record shows that in 1987 an Act was passed to dismiss the Dublin transport authority, which was established by a coalition Government.  On the list of luminaries who voted for its abolition was Deputy Noel Dempsey.  Perhaps that is the reason for his absence — he is embarrassed that he voted against the authority and, 21 years later, must vote for it without a proper democratic mandate.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">Yes.  I do not know whether he is now a member of the Cowen or Bertie gang or some other gang.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Bill relates to the questions of how people get to and from work, quality of life and improving services.  In principle, Fine Gael supports the establishment of a Dublin transport authority.  The Bill has many positive elements, but there is a serious democratic deficit in the proposals.  The Minister of State's comments regarding the growth in Dublin's population were correct, but the average speed of a car, bus or whatever in the city is 13 kph.  The average speeds in Belfast and in Cologne in Germany are 27 kph and 40 kph, respectively.  The city's serious transport issues, such as bottlenecks, must be addressed.  The Bill, which proposes to establish and provide new powers for an authority, is at the core of changing how we live and get to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The president of a strategic transport group gave a logistics speech in which he stated that in 1957, when Sputnik was launched, one could go to and from the airport in 20 minutes during rush hour.  The situation has changed considerably.  Family life and the economy suffer when people cannot be on time for work because of bottlenecks and trucks breaking down on essential transport corridors.  The business community estimates that €2 billion is lost to the economy per year due to traffic delays.  This serious issue affects people adversely.  Even minor delays, such as flooding or, as occurred last year, the overturning of a truck on an inner bypass just off the M50, can block the city for hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Family life has suffered greatly as a result of congestion in cities, with families enjoying poor quality time together.  The figures given by the Minister of State in respect of the considerable population increase in the greater Dublin area are accurate, but tired children are going to bed even before their tired parents get home, meaning that the latter do not get to see their children.  Family life and commuters suffer greatly due to our poor transport system.  That is not to claim that there are no good proposals, such as the metro and so on, but this is the world in which we live.  As we change it and try to create a new, dynamic body to address current and future transport problems, we must consider what is being done at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">My criticisms of the Bill relate to the democratic deficit.  Given the comments of the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it is a key consideration that a body such as this authority does not become a HSE for transport — the HSE is unaccountable and has no transparency or openness.  The fact that public representatives are not involved in its management structure or anywhere along the line is its key weakness.  It will also be the key weakness in the DTA.  I am referring to democratic accountability as opposed to democratic control.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made much of the Green Paper setting out his plans for an elected lord mayor of Dublin.  The next local elections will take place in one year's time but the Minister does not plan to introduce his provisions until 2011.  The problem is that there is a lack of commitment to the introduction of a directly elected lord mayor.  This Bill will come into force on 1 January 2009.  On 1 June or 1 July next year, after the local elections, there is no reason that a newly elected lord mayor should not take the chairmanship of this authority.  This would be a way of addressing the significant democratic deficit that exists in the legislation.  Appointing the lord mayor to the chairmanship will help to ensure the activities and policies of the Dublin transport authority are accountable, transparent and open.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, said that Government policy in this regard would be outlined in the White Paper.  However, he did not say that the lord mayor will be the chairman of the authority.  I presume, therefore, that there is some doubt in this regard.  I ask that he clarify this key issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">For the purposes of accountability, the membership of the advisory board should include elected representatives.  One of the key recommendations of the body which looked at the problems that might arise in regard to the work of the proposed Dublin transport authority was that the advisory body should include one elected representative for each of the regions in the Dublin area.  However, that proposal has been thrown out by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  The year's delay in the introduction of this legislation has resulted in less democratic accountability than we anticipated and expected.  The Minister seems to have used that time to water down the accountability and transparency provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I can find no reference in the Bill to accountability to the Dáil.  We on this side of the House will not vote for the legislation unless it includes such a provision.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_509">We will not allow the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to set up another quango that is not accountable to the Oireachtas.  All Members are aware of the problems with the HSE.  As I said, a positive provision in terms of accountability would be to make the lord mayor the chairperson of the Dublin transport authority.  A stipulation that the advisory committee must include local authority members would also be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Accountability to the Dáil is another aspect of the accountability requirement.  Day after day, parliamentary questions are tabled to the Minister for Transport on the activities of Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and so on.  We receive some degree of accountability in the House in this regard.  I am concerned that the Bill's provisions may erode even this level of accountability and we will be in a position where we are constantly receiving letters from the Ceann Comhairle's office telling us that we cannot raise such issues in the Chamber because they are not a matter for the Dáil.  We must be able to discuss the activities of the Dublin transport authority in this House by way of parliamentary questions or Adjournment debate.  That will be critical to the success of the authority.  We will not support a HSE-type body in the area of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The question of membership of the board is not adequately dealt with in the legislation.  There should be a process by which commuters, who represent neither trade unions, business nor politics but rather the users of the system, are consulted.  Representatives of commuter groups should be included on the board so that the voice of the consumer is heard clearly.  Such an approach may lead to a sharper focus on the part of the chief executive officer of the board.  As well as the input of vested interests — I do not use that term negatively but rather in reference to the business community, trade unions, transport companies and so on — the chief executive officer should be able to avail of the insight provided by those who use the system.  Commuter groups must have access to the highest level of the decision-making process.  As I said, we must avoid at all costs the creation of another body in the mode of the HSE.  We do not want a board whose members we cannot speak to, seek to influence or question.  As it stands, however, this Bill will lead to just such a scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">One of the key difficulties with the Bill is that it is not all-encompassing.  The Minister originally proposed to incorporate the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, within the new transport authority.  After thinking about it for a year, however, he has changed his mind.  We will now have two bodies with the same powers, the RPA and the Dublin transport authority.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage proposing that the RPA be absorbed into the Dublin transport authority.  I do not accept the reasons offered by the Minister of State that this should not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">There must be a single organisation with a single voice.  The RPA has been in disagreement with Iarnród Éireann for some time in regard to the Broadstone debacle, which Senator Paschal Donohoe brought to our attention.  He is an active Senator in this area and will be a successful Deputy in the future.  The dispute between the RPA and Iarnród Éireann might have led to land being cut off and communities being denied the transport corridor they needed.  The situation was ultimately resolved but it is important that a similar dispute does not recur.  I acknowledge and respect the tremendous professional commitment demonstrated by the RPA.  However, it must not continue as an entity operating separately from the Dublin transport authority but should instead be absorbed into it.  There can be no more turf wars.  The way to prevent them is to ensure there is no other entity with many of the same powers as the Dublin transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The new broadcasting Bill will include a provision to oblige members of the RTE authority to come before the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Minister has taken upon himself the power to appoint whoever he wishes to the board of the Dublin transport authority.  In the interests of transparency and accountability, the Oireachtas Committee on Transport should have the power to grill the Minister's appointees as to their experience and suitability.  Moreover, the committee should be allowed to declare an appointee unsuitable.  We will make clear to the Minister that we will not accept appointees who are merely party political hacks, regardless of which party that is.  We want people who know the business and who live, work or travel in Dublin.  If there is accountability before the Oireachtas committee, as is proposed in regard to the broadcasting Bill 2008, the Bill will be stronger and more effective and will lead to greater accountability and better performance.  We need to improve the transport system in a transparent manner in terms of having the power to question decisions rather than change them.  People on the board should be able to challenge decisions as they arise from the point of view of system users.  The DTA should be responsible to the Members of this House.  It should not just be a matter of its chairman appearing for 90 minutes before a committee once per year to discuss annual accounts.  That is the amount of time we give to the NRA and other bodies because it is all that is available through the committee system.  We want more accountability so that we can deal with controversies and get answers from the Minister.  We want to hold debates on the Adjournment and raise issues on Leaders' Questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Transport users will not have choices until the metro is constructed.  Not every bus user is a commuter because a significant number of travellers, such as older people and students, are not going to work.  New areas in Dublin city and surrounding counties lack proper public transport services.  We want to see more buses, greater choice for transport users and stronger competition in the bus market.  That is a cumbersome procedure under the Road Transport Act 1932, and it needs to be urgently reformed.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, has said he will not introduce competition into the bus market before next year at the earliest but we will propose amendments on Committee Stage to open the market in Dublin to competition.  That was Government policy.  When Deputy Brennan was Minister for Transport, 25% of the market was to be opened, a figure which was reduced to 15% under the subsequent Minister, Deputy Cullen.  The present Minister was reported in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> as stating there would not be competition but he has since advised us not to believe what we read in the newspapers.  He may be about to make some sort of commitment but that is not good enough.  This Bill presents an excellent opportunity to increase competition.  It is not just a matter of competition, however, because we need to provide choice in terms of more buses on more routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">We cannot leave the matter to Dublin Bus.  I am not here to criticise the company or its workforce but restrictive practices have existed in the past and issues arise in respect of public service obligations.  We will have greater transparency from Dublin Bus and better services if the consumer has more choice.  We are not calling for competition between service providers on existing routes, however, because we recommend competitive tendering, with franchises for one year or longer.  Clearly, it costs a lot of money to purchase a bus so we do not expect to restrict the franchise to one year.  The Minister for Transport proposes that the routes given to Dublin Bus will remain with the company for five years, which seems a long time.  That is not a competitive way to approach the matter.  We would like this Bill to reform the 1932 Act and we will propose amendments that turn the DTA into a one stop shop to consider and control these factors.  We do not want closed shops, routes that do not expand or communities without transport.  I do not care what colour the bus may be, as long as it provides a choice to consumers.  Competitive tendering will make an impact in that respect.  The Progressive Democrat Party is in favour of bus competition and the Green Party recommends reform of the 1932 Act in the policy paper it published yesterday, which means every party but Fianna Fáil wants to introduce reforms.  We are advocating the inclusion of reform in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The operation of the Freedom of Information Act is important.  Freedom of information is a critical legislative power allowing John citizen to find out what is going on.  By selectively watering down the legislation, this Government has made it increasingly difficult for Opposition Members to find out what Ministers are up to.  The freedom of information requirements under this Bill appear to allow the transport provider to decide what it shall call restricted information, thereby giving it more power than it is entitled to.  It is not that we are going to seek sensitive commercial information but we want to know what is going on and the nature of the choices we face.  Freedom of information regulations can be used by citizens and journalists in that regard.  I would like the Bill to be as open as possible and apply freedom of information to areas such as public service obligation routes and the truth about what is happening in Dublin Bus.  We cannot find this information at present.  I do not imply, however, that Dublin Bus has not been open to meetings or exchanges of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The need has arisen for a national transport authority.  Issues that arise in Dublin which apply nationwide will not be addressed unless the powers of the DTA are extended to a national transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">There are positive elements in this Bill and we have consistently called for legislation to be introduced in this area.  Legislation we previously introduced in the House to provide for a Dublin transport authority was rejected by Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">This Bill's strength lies in its provisions on planning and development.  It is right and proper that corruption will no longer exist in local government.  We will have no further Mahon tribunals for this region if every planning decision, development plan and rezoning is subject to the DTA approval in respect of infrastructure.  Regardless of who the councillors are or which authority they represent, they will have to provide sustainable planning and development.  That is a critical part of this Bill and it is a measure which I strongly support.  However, these issues extend beyond Dublin.  I have read in newspapers about issues pertaining to Killarney and elsewhere in the country.  Many towns and villages have been affected by urban sprawl because of bad planning decisions.  I welcome the requirement that An Bord Pleanála must have due regard for the views of the DTA when it makes decisions in this area.  However, the Minister is losing a golden opportunity by not extending that power to other local authorities.  This is an important power and it will make a massive difference to communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">There is a weakness in the Bill in respect of the constituency I represent.  Provision is made in the Bill in respect of the counties immediately adjacent to Dublin.  I refer here to Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  In the Seanad, the Labour Party tabled an amendment, with which I agree, to the effect that the Drogheda Borough Council area should be included under the Bill.  There is a provision in the Bill under which the Minister can extend the remit of the DTA if it so recommends.  However, that is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Like east Meath, south Louth is becoming a concrete jungle.  If one were to examine the demography and development patterns of east Meath, for which the Bill makes provision, and south Louth, for which it does not, one would see that the two areas are beset by the same problems.  There are massive housing estates and a lack of transport infrastructure in both areas.  The residents are confused and angry, particularly on foot of the fact that there is an insufficient number of schools, etc., in their areas.  The Minister and his officials should consider extending the remit of the DTA to cover south Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">My final point relates to the need for transparency in respect of rail fares.  I welcome the fact that the DTA will have the power to fix the fares that will be charged by Iarnród Éireann in particular.  People are being ripped off in respect of such fares.  People from Balbriggan travelling by train from Dublin pay half the fare paid by their fellow passengers who live in Drogheda and Dundalk.  The system of fares is inequitable.  When one passes Balbriggan, one is obliged to pay an entirely different fare.  People are being ripped off left, right and centre by Iarnród Éireann.  This is a major issue.  The power granted to the DTA in respect of fixing fares may end this great rip off on the part of Iarnród Éireann.  I will return to this matter on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">There are many good elements in the Bill.  However, without accountability, transparency and openness, we will vote against it because we will not support the creation of another HSE for bureaucrats.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_525">I am delighted to finally have the opportunity to discuss the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  In many ways we have been waiting 21 years for the Bill.  As Deputy O'Dowd stated, in 1987, in an astonishing act of political vandalism, the fledgling Dublin Transport Authority, which had been established under the previous Labour and Fine Gael Government, was abolished by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  I, therefore, welcome the belated publication of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  The re-establishment of this critical transport body for the often gridlocked greater Dublin area is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The legislation has, of course, been promised as a priority by a long succession of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Transport, including Deputies O'Rourke, Cullen and Brennan.  In light of the years of preparation and lengthy discussion, the final Bill is somewhat disappointing and incomplete.  The result of the Government's lethargy and delay has been an ongoing public transport deficit in the greater Dublin area and massive traffic problems and congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Key measures on prioritising commuters and democratic accountability are missing from the legislation.  I am opposed to the Dublin transport authority becoming what has been termed a "HSE on wheels".  Inexplicably, the full integration of a number of other agencies and regulators — such as the Taxi Regulator — is not contemplated by the Bill.  I note the Minister's comments in the Seanad in this regard.  However, the Bill does not provide clarity in respect of the confusing and antiquated 1932 bus licensing laws.  Other enforcement measures, particularly in the areas of planning and transport provision, are simply not strong enough.  These omissions are astonishing in view of the many years that successive Ministers for Transport have supposedly been working on the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The absence of the DTA and the failure of Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his predecessor, Deputy Cullen, to provide strong leadership on delivering the €34 billion Transport 21 programme has seen massive slippage in projects just two years into that programme's lifetime.  When the Transport 21 plans were published, the DTA was specifically mentioned as the key body to facilitate the delivery of the much needed transport infrastructure projects like metro north and the Dublin rail interconnector.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Last November, the Minister outlined an astonishing litany of delays and missed deadlines that have already occurred in respect of Transport 21.  It will be 2014 at the earliest, rather than 2012, before metro north is scheduled to be completed.  I know this from having spoken to some of those who are competing for tenders.  The completion date for the Tallaght to Citywest Luas extension has been revised from 2008 to 2010, the Connolly to Docklands Luas line has been pushed back from 2008 to 2009 and the critical link up of the green and red Luas lines has, astonishingly, been stalled indefinitely.  In addition, the completion date for the long-promised phase 1 of the Navan rail link has been revised from 2009 to 2010.  The list of projects that have been delayed goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The watchword for the Labour Party and me in developing transport services and infrastructure in the greater Dublin area and beyond is sustainability.  Labour believes that establishing a sustainable, integrated and accessible transport system with commuters at its core must be the priority.  At its most fundamental, a transport system involves moving people and goods.  The needs of commuters — including cyclists and pedestrians — must, therefore, be at the heart of sustainable travel and transport services.  Labour's vision for Ireland's travel and transport system in 2020 is one that is responsive, sustainable, integrated, accessible and safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">For the various reasons to which I refer, the very belated establishment of the DTA must be warmly welcomed.  However, there are significant gaps and deficiencies apparent within the Bill.  I hope to outline some of these and return to them on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">One of the most complex elements of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill is the establishment of public transport performance related contracts under sections 47 to 55, inclusive.  The Minister and his Department have proposed these clauses in response to Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007, which will come into effect in December 2009.  The Department argues that there has never been any contractual basis to the provision of services by CIE, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus or Irish Rail and that such contracts are necessary for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007.  When the regulation comes into force, it will, therefore, be imperative to have established the legal contractual basis for public transport services under Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Under section 52 of the Bill, the first direct award public service contracts will be awarded to Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail.  However, these contracts will be reviewed after just five years for bus services and ten years for rail services.  By contrast, under section 48 all private bus operators will be awarded ten-year contracts — with 15-year contracts for metro and light rail.  Why is there not a level playing field in respect of the contract timescales relating to private and public operators?  Is it not eminently possible that after the five and ten-year periods the directly awarded contracts may be reviewed and that key licences will be removed from the core public transport service providers, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail?  Will this prove to be privatisation by stealth?  Will it finally herald the introduction of the discredited plan put forward by the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, to facilitate bus privatisation by the back door?</p>
          <p eId="para_534">This matter is particularly important in light of the failure of the current Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to spell out what he intends to do in respect of the 1932 bus licensing laws.  This is a glaring omission in the legislation before us.  The Bill indicates that Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann will continue to provide public bus passenger services and to service routes under the 1932 laws.  However, there is ongoing dissatisfaction in both the public and private bus sectors as regards the sometimes baffling operation of those laws by the Minister and his officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann representatives have expressed their frustration with the current licensing situation at meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport and at briefings.  For example, Dublin Bus has long planned to create a local services network for the massively expanding Swords area and to run the No. 41X bus route through the Dublin Port tunnel.  However, its intentions in this regard have been stymied by the way the Minister and his Department interpret the 1932 bus licensing laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Clarity and transparency are urgently needed in respect of bus licensing.  The Minister informed the Seanad that he intends to bring forward a Bill to modernise the licensing regime for bus services in line with the commitments in the agreed programme for Government.  He also indicated that he intends to reform the 1932 and 1958 Acts.  Why could this not have been achieved under the Bill before us, particularly as we have waited so many years for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The route by route allocation procedure as laid out in section 48(3) is problematic.  I intend to table amendments in respect of it.  This procedure may prove an incentive to be inefficient.  As public service obligation routes under direct award contracts become profitable, there are concerns that such routes will be tendered out under section 48 and that public service operators may be left with the less successful, loss-making, subsidised routes.  What incentives does the legislation, as drafted, contain for public sector companies offering inclusive services to be as profitable and efficient as possible?  Section 56 mandates that the DTA can be an operator of last resort if a public transport operator will not provide services on terms and conditions acceptable to the authority.  It could, therefore, be possible for the DTA to eventually directly provide public transport services and regulate performance and fares of itself and all other operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">How does the Minister envisage that system will operate and how can a regulator be expected to fairly regulate itself?  Should we perhaps consider giving CIE such a role as operator of last resort, as was intended in 1945?  After all, there is no need to reinvent the wheel if the expertise and experience already exist within CIE.  There is also a risk that if this Bill is not amended in that manner, it could result in the death-knell for CIE, the mother company of our State companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Sections 5, 25 and 29 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, for example, transfer the greater Dublin area transport Vote from CIE to the DTA.  In section 30, the DTA is given wide borrowing powers of up to €1 billion.  This, in effect, removes one of the CIE board's core functions and could completely eviscerate the organisation.  Section 111 removes the power of the chair and board of CIE to make appointments to the boards of Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Part 3 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill details the DTA's significant powers in terms of securing public transport infrastructure and services.  Under Section 44, the DTA will procure infrastructure and services, although it will normally work through the auspices of existing agencies such as the Rail Procurement Agency for metro or light rail and Irish Rail for rail infrastructure.  Questions have been raised, as my colleague outlined, about why the RPA was not subsumed into the DTA because of a possible duplication of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Speaking in the Seanad on this Bill, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, argued for retaining the RPA because of the need to maintain institutional stability in the current fragile global economic context in terms of the delivery of metro north's PPP.  I accept the Minister's bona fides on this point.  I also agree with the outstanding former chairperson of the Rail Procurement Agency, Mr. Pádraig White, that the RPA clearly won the argument that it is essential to maintain the RPA to deliver on time key projects such as metro north, metro west, the Luas extension to Lucan and so on.  I will consider a possible amendment in this regard that perhaps towards the end of Transport 21, the RPA might migrate to the DTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">There are also serious questions regarding the extent of the powers of the DTA.  Section 54 establishes the DTA as the transport regulator over any surface public transport service that commences or terminates in the greater Dublin area if the Minister so designates.  This provides huge scope for the expansion of the DTA across the whole Leinster and midlands regions and beyond.  Is the DTA, and this powerful expansionary clause, merely the first step in the establishment of a national transport regulator?  If that is the case, should we have established in the Bill a national transport regulator?  Why did the Minister not introduce such a measure?</p>
          <p eId="para_543">A coherent and integrated approach is also needed in the development and management of transport infrastructure and services outside the greater Dublin area.  It appears that in this regard the DTA is little more than a halfway house.  Commuters using services that begin or end in the greater Dublin area will be subject to the pricing regime of the DTA as the public transport fares regulator.  However, communities outside the greater Dublin area, or mid-Leinster area if we wish to call it that, will have no responsible authority in terms of the enforcement of integrated transport and planning measures.  Key decisions and resources for critically necessary rural transport programmes are thus again being put on the long finger.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the new drink-driving limits.  Significant expansion is needed, not just for social provision in rural areas, but across the board of the rural transport programme, and we are not taking that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Public transport staff and drivers are key workers in any economy.  Many transport workers are also safety-critical workers and the lives and safety of hundreds of thousands of commuters are in their hands every day.  Landmark hearings of the House of Commons transport committee were held on the UK transport privatisation experience.  One of the key lessons outlined to our UK colleagues during those hearings was that transport workers' wages and conditions were the main sources of cost-cutting measures during the disastrous UK transport privatisation process.  This must not be repeated with any initiatives taken under the DTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">A sustainable, integrated and safe transport system for all commuters cannot be delivered unless the highest standards and working conditions are upheld for all transport workers.  The Minister must ensure this reality is reflected in the Dublin Transport Authority Bill as I believe he is a former transport worker.  For these reasons, the Labour Party will seek to amend the aims and functions of the DTA in sections 10 and 11 to include the promotion of the highest possible standard of working conditions, including fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Part 1 of the Bill describes the DTA's mandate as covering the greater Dublin area and comprising the geographical area of the four Dublin local authority areas and counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  These areas are increasingly an integrated region in economic, social and infrastructural terms.  However, it is ludicrous to exclude County Louth from the greater Dublin area, as my colleague from the area stated, and particularly the south Louth and Drogheda area when it is so clearly also a part of the greater Dublin hinterland in transport, social and economic terms.  Drogheda and Dundalk are as much a part of the mid-Leinster or greater Dublin area as are Dunshaughlin, Arklow and Naas.  There are huge numbers of Louth residents who commute to Meath, Dublin and Kildare for work everyday.  North County Dublin, west Meath and south Louth is a cogent and coherent region.  I hope the Minister will return to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Part 2 of the Bill establishes and lists the general functions of the authority and, in section 11(e), refers to effective management of demand.  One of the principal functions of the new DTA will be as regulator of public transport fares.  Many citizens have bitterly opposed the gas and electricity pricing policy that has been imposed by the energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, since its establishment.  Under the CER pricing regime, gas skyrocketed by over 100% between 2002 and 2006 and the price of electricity increased by 66% between 2002 and 2006.  The year 2007 was the first that CER sanctioned an energy price decrease.  What the CER and energy pricing experience highlights are the dangers of letting a regulator set prices in an unaccountable and opaque manner.  In effect, the CER became a handy mudguard for the Minister to deflect all the Government's flak on soaring energy costs, which continue to hit the most vulnerable in our society.  There are great fears that the Minister could attempt to repeat the same feat with the DTA and public transport fares.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Early this year, there were very significant fare increases in Luas, Bus Éireann, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus fares, which were sanctioned by the Minister.  Single Luas tickets went up by 10 cent and fares on Dublin Bus, DART and all commuter and inter-city Irish Rail services also increased by approximately 5% .  This means there has been an overall significant increase in public transport fares by 37.6% since 2000 and by 30.4% since 2002.  Lower public transport fares are critical for encouraging a modal shift to public transport.  The Minister will remember that in the run-in to the general election, my colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall, proposed on our behalf that we would have a €1 flat bus fare for adults and a 50 cent per trip fare for children in the greater Dublin region.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In the wider context, there are significant issues surrounding the DTA and its democratic accountability.  The Labour Party has long supported a DTA that has real and enforceable powers to oversee the development of integrated transport infrastructure and is fully accountable to the citizens of the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">However, Chapter 2 of Part 2 lays out the governance arrangements and it is extremely disappointing that there are no directly elected representatives on the ten-person board of the DTA.  In effect, five of the members will be officials or directly appointed by the Minister.  They clearly have a profound influence on the work of the DTA.  With regard to section 14(2)(<i>d</i>), for example, why is there not a qualifying section like section 16(5) referring to prescribed organisations for the DTA main board and advisory council?</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I am a former member of the Dublin regional authority and we liaised very closely with the mid-east regional authority, attempting to move on the demand for this authority to be set up.  There will be only four councillors on the 13-member DTA advisory council, which will also include a large number of officials, three city and county managers, a senior Garda and the ministerially appointed member. Why are the directly elected representatives of the people of the greater Dublin area being so plainly excluded from the decision-making structures and institutions of the DTA?  As my colleague stated, there is no provision for any direct statutory input into the DTA board from commuters or commuters' representative groups.  We will return to this in amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Green Party Minister, Deputy Gormley, recently published his local government Green Paper.  How will the DTA operate within the structure of the new directly-elected mayoral system?  Will this happen in 2011 or 2014?  Will the directly-elected person chair the body?  There is a strong case for having a directly-elected chair so the people of these seven or eight counties would be able to go into a polling booth and vote for the person who will have this core and key power.  There have been strong suggestions recently that the mayor will act as the DTA's chair.  I welcome that.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_557">Since the introduction of the programme of investment in information and communications technology in 1998, almost €200 million has been invested in information and communications technology in schools.  Some €80 million was provided to schools in equipment grants under the Schools ICT 2000 and Blueprint for the Future of ICT schemes.  A further €23 million has been provided since 2004 to develop the networking capacity of schools and facilitate the full exploitation by schools of the potential offered by broadband connectivity and the efficient use by schools of computer software.  The current national development plan provides for investment of €252 million in information and communications technology in schools between 2007 and 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor appointed a strategy group to advise on the priorities for expenditure on information and communications technology in schools.  I intend to publish the group's report shortly.  The report will cover areas of required investment over the lifetime of the national development plan.  At its core will be the embedding of information and communications technology in the teaching and learning culture of schools.  This will require continuing investment in teacher professional development to build further on the impressive teacher participation levels which have been evident to date.  It will require the continuing maintenance of a national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware and the provision of software and digital content.  It will be important to focus on the provision of technical support to schools and the development of appropriate models in a cost effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">Decisions on the timing and amount of expenditure in this area this year must be made in the overall context of the current budgetary situation.  I am required to work within the budget set for the Department of Education and Science.  My officials and I are reviewing the overall financial position with regard to spending trends and emerging pressures.  Following this review, I anticipate that I will be in a position to make decisions on specific areas of expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">In his response to Question No. 79, which relates to the development of information and communications technology in our schools, the Minister seemed to suggest that the €252 million that is allegedly earmarked for this sector over the course of the national development plan may be at risk.  Can the Minister unequivocally tell the House whether the €252 million which was dedicated for the development of information and communications technology in schools over the course of the national development plan is absolutely guaranteed?</p>

            <p eId="para_562">I thought I had made it plain that I am discussing the exact financial position with my officials.  It has not been easy to examine all the funding issues in the Department of Education and Science.  I am not in a position today to say "Yes, something will happen".  I have provided for expenditure in the schools sector of approximately €20 million, on the current side.  I will continue to fund the National Centre for Technology in Education, which provides more than 10,000 continuing professional development training places to teachers each year.  I am in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, on the issue of broadband services in schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">The Minister has now honestly told the Dáil that there is no absolute, firm and gilt-edged guarantee that this money will be provided for schools.  Is he aware that Ireland is ranked 20th of 30 OECD countries in respect of expenditure in this area?  Does he know that Ireland is ranked 19th of the 27 EU member states in respect of the roll-out of broadband?  We have one computer for every ten children in this country.  Our information and communications technology funding record is abysmal.  The Minister, unlike his predecessor, has been honest with the Dáil.  He has admitted that there is no commitment to provide a €252 million spending package.  This news will come as a bombshell to schools.  Can the Minister tell the Dáil whether he has read the report of the expert group?  I understand that the group has said that an allocation of €252 million would be insufficient to meet the technological development needs of this country's schools.  Can the Minister confirm whether the expert group has told him that?</p>

        <b>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
           if discussions have taken place with the Department of Finance on the use of public money on the hiring and renting of prefabricated classrooms for primary schools when the same income flow over 30 years would cover the cost of capital borrowing from either commercial financial institutions or would be cheaper if borrowed at Exchequer borrowing rates for the construction of a permanent building; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   
        [19767/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_423" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_577">Officials in the Department of Education and Science discuss the overall allocation of current and capital expenditure with their counterparts in the Department of Finance in the context of the preparation of the annual Estimates.  General discussions are normally held on the amount of funding allocated to the subhead from which payment for the rental of temporary accommodation for schools is made.  However, no specific discussions have taken place about the borrowing of money by the Exchequer for the construction of permanent buildings in the manner referred to by the Deputy.  Following concerns raised by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Education and Science recently examined its expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation with a view to identifying the point at which the purchase of such accommodation provides better value for money.  As a result of the review, the Department of Education and Science now has a policy of purchasing temporary accommodation when the need for it is likely to last more than three years.  This change in policy will minimise the amount of money spent on the rental of accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">The permanent accommodation scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabricated classrooms.  It was designed to ensure that value for money is a feature of the provision of permanent accommodation in place of prefabricated accommodation when it is decided that an accommodation need is likely to exist for a considerable length of time.  Since the introduction of the scheme, more than €100 million has been allocated to schools.  This expenditure has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools throughout the country.  Such facilities have been provided in addition to the classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by the Department of Education and Science.  If the permanent accommodation scheme had not been in place, a significant proportion of the classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided, as competing priorities mean it will not always be possible to put a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short timeframe.  The Department of Education and Science will continue to provide funding for prefabricated accommodation.  Decisions on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the length of time such accommodation is likely to be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">I thank the Minister for his reply.  He has not answered in full the question I asked, but he gave the reply his Department prepared for him.  Will he not agree that for mature primary schools with all eight classes that have a proven need for accommodation — not start-up schools where there is a lead-in time as children move up classes starting with junior infants — the present policy of hiring prefabs is nonsense?  It is a bit like having money on deposit in the post office and going to a moneylender to get cash.  In one school, the details of which were submitted with the question, the annual cost of the rental, which is dead money, would finance a loan of €5 million over 30 years, which would provide for the construction of a solid building.  I invite the Minister, if he is not yet at that stage, to enter into a serious dialogue with the Department of Finance on this issue.  Considering the current financing policy, none of the officials in the Department of Education and Science would pass a junior or leaving certificate business organisation or economics examination if they were to sit it on the basis of their behaviour.</p>

We have made significant improvements in getting much more permanent accommodation over three years.  We have been reviewing the cost-effectiveness of what we are doing.  The capital programme has been improved dramatically over the years.  I am considering other ways of doing business, as the Deputy suggests.  I am engaging outside experts to review the way we do business in terms of renting and purchasing prefab accommodation.  They will also consider how we might progress our demands as they arise in terms of the planning we should put in place and whether we should have a proper systematic layout throughout the school system.</p>

If he is to engage in a programme of capital expenditure during a downturn in the construction industry, which could be very positive and beneficial generally, would he consider using the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act to accelerate the planning?  Many applications are stuck in the planning process at present.  There is nothing more strategically important than the education system for our knowledge economy.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian Hayes</b>
        asked the

           his policy in respect of reducing class size; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_437" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_595">The programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position on the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000 and on that basis to make further progress in reducing class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion, or €380 million extra, for teacher pay and pensions.  That was a very substantial level of additional investment in terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based.  That allocation provides for more than 2,000 extra primary teachers, more than the number in schools when the Government took office last summer.  It covers the additional teachers who went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27:1 based staffing schedule with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments and provide for special needs and for the language requirements of newcomer children.  This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4,000 additional teachers, the Government, in its first two years in office, will be well ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">All programme for Government commitments to improve public services, including those relating to class size, are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  Even since the presentation of budget 2008 last December, there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment.  In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of more than 2,000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment, all things considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Similarly, the commitment to improving class size in second level schools can only be considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_599">It is widely accepted that the issue of class size was the Stalingrad issue that resulted in the Minister's predecessor being moved from the Department of Education and Science.  Any reasonable observer, to use the Minister's words, might come to the conclusion that the Government promised in 2002 that no child of nine years of age or younger would be in a class of 20 or more by 2007.  How many children of nine or under are now in a class of 20 or more?  Is it still the commitment of the Government to have a ratio of no more than 20:1 for classes with children of nine or younger?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_600">I do not have that information today, but I can obtain it for the Deputy.  It was proposed to recruit 4,000 extra teachers over the period of the plan.  Two years into that five-year plan we now have in excess of 2,000 additional teachers.  Any fair-minded observer can see that the commitment to appoint additional teachers is being honoured.  The Deputy is aware of the pressures on the Exchequer.  However, after two years the Government has delivered additional teachers beyond what it was required to do.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_440">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_601">Let us be absolutely clear about this matter.  The Government gave that commitment in 2002.  It is not a new commitment by the Minister.  The Government gave a firm commitment to reduce the staffing schedule from 27:1 to 24:1 in the first three years of the Government, which took office last year.  It welshed on that commitment in last year's budget.  The reason there are 2,000 more teachers is that a growing population of young people are going into schools and it is inevitable that a greater number of teachers is required.  However, I want an absolute assurance on the Minister's commitments.  From the Minister's reply it seems he is falling into the same trap as his predecessor in that this commitment is now forgotten about, ignored and put to one side.  The Minister has had two weeks to find his feet on this issue.  Will he deliver next year on a promise that he should have delivered this year?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_602">The Deputy seems to forget that all commitments in the plan were predicated on the basis of the economic well-being and resources that were available.  There is a commitment to have 4,000 teachers and it is my intention that we will honour that.  There is a commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  The former Minister indicated as part of the budget for 2008 that this was being set aside for 2008.  Obviously we will review this issue in light of the funding available in the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_603">Last week, I published a list of 40 schools around the country that will lose a teacher from 1 September.  Many of those schools have lost one or two pupils from their enrolment last September, even though they have increased their enrolment since then.  As a gesture of goodwill on the Minister's part, will he consider safeguarding the 42 teachers in those 40 schools that will lose a teacher in September and, inevitably, will push up the average number of children in each of the classes in those schools?</p>

            <p eId="para_604">The Deputy is aware that an arrangement is in place and he is asking me to break that arrangement.  He is saying that we should allocate extra teachers but that when there is a fall-off in pupil numbers I should break the rules.  I have to be fair.  The number of teachers that will be affected is approximately 50 and, overall, we are employing an extra 500 teachers.  What is important is the quality of teaching.  We are lucky in that the quality of persons wishing to become involved in the education system is of the highest standard.  The most important issue that emerges from surveys of parents is the quality of teaching.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">In 1995, Ireland participated in an international literacy survey of adults conducted by the OECD, which found that approximately 25% of Irish adults between 16 and 64 years old were at the lowest literacy level — level one.  Those are the most recent statistics available.  However, Ireland has agreed to participate in the initial development work and feasibility study for a new survey to be carried out by the OECD entitled the programme for international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC.  This survey of adult competencies, including literacy and numeracy, is due to be completed in 2012 to 2013.  Participation in the main study will be decided on the basis of the results of the development work and feasibility study.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">On foot of the 1995 survey findings, the Government identified improving adult literacy as the top priority in adult education.  That has been reflected in the funding for adult literacy, which has increased incrementally from €1 million in 1997 to €30 million in 2007.  In the same period, the number of participants has increased from 5,000 to approximately 44,000.  A total of 3,000 additional places were provided in 2007 in line with commitments in the Towards 2016 partnership agreement and the programme for Government.  Since 2000, more than a quarter of a million learners have availed of the adult literacy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">Adult literacy will also be an important aspect of the work of the interdepartmental committee that I chair and which is preparing an implementation plan for the national skills strategy.  Adult literacy services are funded by my Department through annual grants to the vocational education committees, VECs, which deliver the services locally.  Community groups and community development projects may also apply to their local VEC for funding to provide adult literacy tuition.  A number of different initiatives have also been developed to tackle adult literacy.  Those include the intensive tuition in adult basic education programme, ITABE, which provides up to six hours of tuition per week to learners instead of the normal two hours;——</p>

           his views on the most recent pastoral letter, Vision 08, from the Irish Catholic bishops conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_469" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_637">The pastoral letter from the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference, Vision 08, that was published last week represents a valuable and welcome contribution to wider dialogue on the overall governance challenge that faces us in seeking to meet future school needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The rapid pace of social and demographic change in Ireland is reflected in a radically altered and more diverse society from which our school communities are drawn.  Schools under the patronage of the Catholic church have been to the fore in welcoming and accommodating the new diversity.  That commitment to community has been at the core of the Catholic school system for many generations and has been a source of immense strength both to the education system itself and to our wider social fabric.  The continuing commitment that is expressed in the pastoral letter to opening Catholic schools to children of all denominations and backgrounds is welcome.  It is entirely appropriate also that Catholic schools should seek to reflect their own distinctive vision and philosophy.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">As the pastoral letter points out, the Catholic church in Ireland played a significant role in the success of the introduction of free post-primary education in 1967.  More recently, the church has had to meet the challenge of securing the future of the ethos of its second level schools at a time when the role of members of the orders in day to day management is greatly diminished as a result of falling numbers of religious.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">At primary school level we have seen a growing diversity of patronage choice in recent years in response to evolving parental demand, with a significant growth of inter-denominational and multi-denominational schools.  More recently, the Government has agreed to pilot a new model of patronage that directly involves the State, through the vocational education committee sector.  This community national school model will welcome children of diverse faith and non-faith backgrounds.  Within this changing landscape, the vast majority of primary schools are, and will continue to be, Catholic in ethos.  As the largest patron group in the education system, the contribution of the church to debate and dialogue on how the system should evolve to respond to changing societal circumstances is essential.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">The Minister is right.  It was a welcome and positive contribution from the Catholic hierarchy, effectively putting forward a White Paper in terms of the way forward.  Will the Minister not agree that the Government and his Department have failed to put forward a similar vision in terms of new patronage models?  The last paragraph of his reply refers to a one day conference but will he not agree this issue is too big for a one day conference and that what we need is a national forum on education where all of the issues concerning management, control, patronage and governance could be examined in a much more public way than is currently the case?  I ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal for a one day conference because it is not acceptable that a one day conference that would examine these fundamental questions would be organised by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">The Government has been active and progressive in examining the patronage and governance in schools issue.  The one day conference is an important venture in that it will bring all the stakeholders together to allow all the views and issues pertinent to this particular issue to be brought into the public domain and discussed.  It does not mean, for instance, that the one day conference is the end of the matter.  I would see it as being the fulcrum from which further debate can take place and the further accommodation of the diverse views in terms of patronage.  I hope the Deputy will find at all times that this will be a listening Department and one that will learn from the suggestions being made because it is in the interests of all of us, Government and Opposition, to learn from what will accrue from that one day conference.</p>

There is no chance it will passed by this House and the other House if it has not been published by the summer.  These two new schools — it was to be three — will be open in west Dublin on 1 September, with teachers and students in place, under the control and patronage of County Dublin VEC.

           the national vetting procedure for teachers; if he is satisfied that the system is robust and comprehensive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_662">In the education sector, vetting is currently done in respect of newly appointed teachers via the initial registration process with the Teaching Council.  It is also done for prospective employees for posts that involve working with children such as special needs assistants, bus drivers, bus escorts to children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">As the expansion of service by the Garda vetting unit is rolled out my Department will be consulting the relevant stakeholders such as school managers and the unions on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers and other education staff working with children.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for this Government, parents, agencies that work with children and society generally.  To that end, the programme for Government provides for a proposed amendment to the Constitution which will further strengthen our ability to protect our children by allowing the Oireachtas to legislate for the exchange of information that is not confined to information on criminal convictions.  The programme is committed to putting in place the necessary structures and systems to increase co-operation on vetting and the exchange of all relevant information about those who work or seek to work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">Furthermore, there is a commitment to provide extra resources to the Garda vetting service and also to develop an all-Ireland approach to child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">It is important to recognise that though vetting is a vital and important process that currently can alert a prospective employer about a criminal record of a prospective employee who will be working with children, it has to be complemented through a general vigilant approach by the employer when recruiting, particularly though checking references with previous employers and probing any gaps in an employment record.  This is as important for individual schools employing personnel as it is for any other employment where the care of children is a concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">I can assure the Deputy that this Government is determined to do all that it can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</p>

Will the Minister concede that there are 55,000 teachers to whom this vetting procedure does not apply?  In the light of his response, is the Minister saying that the improvement in the vetting process is in some way linked to a constitutional amendment because if that is the case it is news to me?  What steps does the Minister propose to take in the immediate future to ensure the expansion and development of the vetting system to include teachers already in employment and not just new teachers coming into the system?</p>
            <p eId="para_669">With reference to the role of his Department, will the Minister spell out precisely his role as Minister for Education and Science in this matter or does he intend to leave it entirely to the boards of management which appear to be introducing different rules and regulations in a haphazard and meaningless way?</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I am concise in what I am saying.  There is a vetting system in place for all new appointments and all temporary appointments.  I agree with the Deputy on the roll-out of vetting for existing staff.  We have been in contact with the Garda vetting unit on that matter and we are trying to build up a capacity between our Department and that unit to ensure a vetting system is put in place in that particular area.  All of that is co-ordinated by the Teaching Council when graduates make their initial application to teaching colleges.  The next roll-out will involve the full-time and existing staff.  That is being done by the Garda vetting unit in conjunction with advice from the implementation group on Garda vetting.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">Regarding the constitutional amendment, and this is important, my colleague, the Minister for children and youth affairs, is the lead Minister on this issue.  The Constitution, as it stands, inhibits the power of the Oireachtas to provide for the exchange of information between gardaí and social services and prospective employers.  This matter is being handled by the constitutional committee, which has received approximately 144 submissions.  We have decided to extend the committee's timeframe, until 30 November 2008, in which to complete its deliberations and make a recommendation to the House.</p>

This was the subject of a report in a newspaper about three weeks ago.  Has the Minister investigated that, is his Department aware of it and how can we ensure the safety of our children and the veracity of a vetting system when in excess of 1,000 untrained teachers are sloshing in and out of the system without any procedures to follow?</p>

            <p eId="para_675">We are obviously aware of it and there will always be some level of unqualified personnel.  That will occur as a result of short-term absences.  It is inevitable that schools must be in a position to have recourse to unqualified personnel.  My predecessor indicated her intention to bring forward amending legislation which would set the limitations on a school's capacity to engage other than qualified teachers, and it is my intention to advance this amendment to the Teaching Council Act 2001 in the current year.</p>

        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
           the position regarding future developments on ABA schools for children with autism.   
        [20205/08] 
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_497" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_681">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 226 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 315 classes have been approved around the country at primary and post-primary level, including many in special schools.  Children in these classes benefit from having fully qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including applied behavioural analysis, ABA, the treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, TEACCH, and the picture exchange communication system, PECS.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full-partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Funding is also provided for assistance technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the special education support service.  A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in applied behavioural analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">My Department's ABA pilot scheme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  Since July 2007, there have been 18 meetings with the autism groups in relation to the commitment in the current programme for Government to long-term funding for the centres that are in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.  The discussions have been wide-ranging and have included curricular issues, funding and staffing.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">Discussions between the autism groups and my Department are progressing well.  My Department is very anxious to finalise these discussions so that permanent arrangements can be put in place as soon as possible.  It has been agreed not to disclose the details of the discussions while they are ongoing. It should be noted that discussions are taking place with Irish Autism Action on 12 of the 13 centres and separate direct discussions are taking place between the Department and the remaining pilot centre.  The Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further on these discussions.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_687">I want to be associated with the earlier comments and congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their new posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Unfortunately, I echo some more of the earlier comments as well.  I am none the wiser after the Minister's answer to the question asked by Deputy Timmins.  Is the funding available for the 12 extra schools or has it been agreed?  The Minister is new in the job and I do not want to give him a hard time, but I point out that the reality is not as he has outlined.  There is a school in Castleknock and I know of another one in Swords where there is a teacher, a classroom and two special needs assistants, who are not particularly well trained in autism, but it is better than nothing.  However, they cannot get access to speech and language therapy, a behavioural psychologist or occupational therapy so that they cannot function.  That is the reality on the ground.  What is the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> funding for the 12 extra ABA schools?  Are they being funded and, in the event, when?  When is it hoped the negotiations will conclude because they have been going on for a very long time?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_689">We prefer to call them discussions rather than negotiations.  My officials will meet again next week to bring this matter to a conclusion.  The Department of Education and Science has sanctioned the establishment of 13 centres for children with autism, which would operate through ABA.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>

            <p eId="para_691">No, all other applications will have to be looked at in the normal way.  There are other applications for recognition and they will be examined in light of various applications in particular areas.  I emphasise we have funding for the 13 centres and we are in negotiations on the 14th.  That is the agreement to date as regards ABA.  However, I do not want to go into further discussion until the two players involved have completed their assignments.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">Does his response represent the fact that the new Minister for Education and Science is approaching the whole issue of autism spectrum disorder with a new copy book?  I must take hope from what he says, that the discussions, as he terms them, will indeed address the serious outstanding issues which were left on the departure of the previous Minister.  I expect the Minister accepts that autism spectrum disorder, by its nature, covers varying degrees of severity and, therefore, different responses are required.  If the Minister is not in a position to provide the detail, what we need is an affirmation of his intent to fully recognise the importance of ABA for those children for whom it is clearly appropriate, and that is the critical point.  We want to see appropriate measures and opportunities in place which are accessible to all children on the basis of their respective needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">Will the Minister indicate a willingness on the part of the Department under his stewardship to approach the whole provision of funding and resources for ABA on the basis of need as required across the board?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_695">With the change of Minister I hope we shall now see a change of attitude from the Department of Education and Science in terms of dealing with this issue and in terms of bringing to a conclusion these discussions because the pilot schools have been in existence for the past nine years.  As my colleague, Deputy Reilly, and others said, the Department only engaged in this issue following the debate in the House in February this year, when the hollowness of the previous Minister's position was exposed for all to see.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">As regards the 12 pilot schools on which the Minister wants the discussions to be concluded, is he saying that once the talks are finished there will be absolute agreement on these institutions, but that a way for other schools to emerge in other parts of the country will be indicated, if that is the choice of parents, where the need arises?</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputies on the child-centred approach.  Meeting the needs of the individual child is what is important.  It was stated the needs of the child can change from time to time and Deputy Ó Caoláin seemed to accept there are different approaches to meeting them.  I come to this issue with an interest in ensuring there is sufficient capacity in the system, that the teachers are professional, that the enhanced resources put in place to date will continue to be made available and that the National Council for Special Education will advise the Department on progress that can be made on this issue.</p>

           if additional funds will be provided by his Department to schools to pay for water rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_506" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_701">I am aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from water charges, and it is therefore a priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools.  Specific commitments on improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the programme for Government.  These commitments are a direct follow-on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of schools, primary schools in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">Primary schools are receiving over €178 per pupil to meet their day-to-day running costs, representing an increase of nearly 70% over the 2002 rate of €105, and €15 more per child than they received last year.  Post-primary schools have also seen improvements in funding and, owing to a similar €15 increase this year, they now receive €331 per pupil.  As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to doubling the capitation grant for primary schools over the lifetime of the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water-saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks.  Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures.  The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some €27 million was issued to primary schools at the end of last year for that purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee-charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation, schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists.  In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.  Furthermore, those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I wish the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, well.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">Much of what the Minister said would be fine were it not for the fact that the Department fails to recognise that the average debt of national schools throughout the country is €23,000.  The content of the circular issued by the Department in response to the water charges issue, namely, that caretakers and cleaners should use proper mop buckets and provide push taps, would be laughable if it were not so serious.  The reality is that there has been no indication from the Minister, in response to this question, as to how much the Department will provide to schools that go ahead with the suggested works and as to when it will provide it.  There is no indication of the cost to schools of obtaining a separate water supply.  When will the Minister provide additional funding to allow boards of management of schools to implement the suggestions in the circular?  How much will he give the schools for this purpose?</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_508" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_711">I do not expect to be in a position to make further improvements to capitation grants in the current year.  However, I am very conscious that it is necessary to increase them and I will keep this need very much in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">Two issues arise, one of which concerns conservation of water in schools.  Fitting simple water-saving devices should be relatively cost-effective.  More important, I would like to see the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, inculcating in children the benefits of conserving water.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">Under the transition arrangements agreed by Government, schools will play a flat fee per pupil.  The fees are €3 per pupil in 2007, €3.50 per pupil in 2008 and €4 per pupil in 2009.  On the basis of metering, the charges applied for 2007 will be recalculated according to the transitional flat rate with credit given for any excess payment.  My legal advice suggests that by 2010 we will have to move towards full cost recovery.  The transition period was to give schools an opportunity to consider their systems of conservation to ensure water would not be wasted.  We have put in place a minor works scheme to ensure that where leaks occur funding can be used to carry out repairs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_714">It is fine to talk about the interim period but the Minister should clarify whether the Department will fund the cost of water provision thereafter.  The circular states the local authorities will be identifying the relevant schools with excessive consumption.  Has there been consultation with the local authorities in this regard?  Most Members realise local authorities do not have the personnel or resources even to identify much more serious difficulties that arise in delivering their services.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I accept the Minister's remarks on the encouragement of young people and schools to engage in water conservation, but we cannot single out schools, penalise them and force them to fund-raise for water, thus distracting them from the provision of quality teaching, which is their primary responsibility.  Why not apply the same principle to Garda stations, military barracks, Departments and the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Why are schools being singled out in this instance?  It is surely incumbent on the Government to ensure teachers are given the wherewithal to get on with the job of teaching and that pupils are given the opportunity to learn, including in respect of the issues the Minister highlighted.  The further noose or requirement placed on boards of management to raise money to provide simple essential services such as water for drinking and flushing toilets is surely unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">I am glad the Deputy agrees there should be a water conservation policy within schools.  Such a policy should be actively pursued.  As for the Deputy's question on the Government response, I already have outlined a transitional arrangement that will be put in place by the Government to alleviate some of the difficulties.  Schools have been given an opportunity until 2010 to put in place conservation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">However, I cannot do anything because the Government has sought legal advice on the EU water framework directive which makes clear that all non-domestic users must pay for water used.  Schools, like other non-domestic water service users, must pay water charges.  The legal advice also confirms they will be required to pay the full cost of water services used by them on a metered basis, with effect from 1 January 2010.</p>

Members do not dispute the legal basis, as that day is over.  While the schools must pay the cost, who will give them the money to do so?  Will it be the Minister or will they be obliged to revert to the parents?</p>

         asked the

           if the quality of the educational provision in primary schools across the country will be enhanced or at least maintained in view of his reversal of the Government’s commitment in the programme for Government to reduce class sizes, thereby depriving schools of the services of more than 140 teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   
        [15574/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_546" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_753">The programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in respect of the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion, or an additional €380 million, for teacher pay and pensions.  This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the context of the economic environment on which the budget was based.  This allocation will pay for an increase of more than 2,000 primary teachers on the number that was teaching in schools when the Government took office last summer.  It covers the additional teachers who went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a staffing schedule based on a ratio of 27:1, as well as additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments and to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.  This means that in respect of the overall commitment to provide at least 4,000 additional teachers, the Government will be well ahead of target in its first two years in office.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">All programme for Government commitments to improve public services, including those relating to class size, are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  Even since the presentation of budget 2008 last December, there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment.  All things considered, any reasonable observer would regard the actions by the Government that will see the allocation of more than 2,000 additional teachers to primary schools to be a considerable investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">As for an impact on the quality of provision, it also must be borne in mind that the number of teachers relative to students is only one of many variables affecting the quality of education provision.  International research on the experiences of the top school systems suggests the three things that matter most are getting the right people to become teachers, developing them into effective instructors and ensuring the teaching system is able to deliver the best possible instruction for every child.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">It is important that the Minister should indicate to the House whether the commitments given in the programme for Government on reducing the staff schedule this year, next year and the following year will be put in place.  I specifically refer to commitments that should be honoured in 2009.  Many schools will lose a teacher or two this year because of the Government's failure to honour its promises.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">I also will refer to a promise made in respect of post-primary education.  A unequivocal commitment was made by the Minister's former leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, at the Ard-Fheis before the recent election that a reduction in class size would take place in respect of the core subjects of Irish, English and mathematics in post-primary education.</p>

In a previous question, I sought illumination on the promise made in 2002 that no child of nine years or under would be in a class of more than 20. Will the Minister state unequivocally whether this promise now stands?</p>

I am not in a position at present to indicate clearly the destination of capital funding or what is the current funding side.

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_785">Under the programme for Government, my Department has established a developing areas unit to provide sufficient school accommodation in those areas experiencing the greatest population growth.  The function of this unit is to liaise with local authorities, to identify where new schools are needed and to ensure that these schools are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">As part of a fast-track programme of construction for September 2008, my Department is building five 16 classroom primary schools and 25 eight classroom primary schools in those areas where school accommodation is under greatest pressure.  More school places will be needed in many other places as well.  This year, €586 million has been provided for the schools building programme.  In addition to the fast-track programme, construction work is expected to be completed on about 48 large-scale primary school projects and 19 large scale post-primary school projects throughout the country.  Additional projects will continue construction into 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">This programme will ease the pressure in the short to medium term.  However, I am aware that the latest publication by the Central Statistics Office on population and labour force projections indicates that the population aged five to 12 years is projected to increase by at least 10% in the next decade.  This will happen even with zero net migration and falling fertility rates.  Depending on the extent of inward migration, the increase could be even greater.  Meeting the demand for school places arising from these increases will in be a major challenge for my Department and for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">In general terms, population growth leading to pressure on primary and post-primary school accommodation is likely to be strongest in the areas along the east coast commuter belt, the greater Dublin area and in the areas surrounding other major cities.  However, many other areas will also experience pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">At the moment, my Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed for 2009 and onwards.  This work will be done in consultation with local authorities.  The findings of this process will be the basis of a further programme of construction for 2009 and 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">Future school accommodation needs are established by looking at overall population growth, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for school places.  My Department is satisfied that the approach it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places, particularly in rapidly developing areas, will ensure that school places will be provided when and where they are needed.</p>

I gave the Minister information relating to a school that is 109 years old, is physically crumbling and infested by rats and so on.  An offer has been made, although it has not been accepted by the Department, to provide a school between now and September at a cost lower than that applying to the rental of prefabs, as was indicated by Deputy Quinn.  This can be done at local level and I ask the Minister to take up this offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">I do not think the picture is as bad as the Deputy paints it.  During my term as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with for responsibility developing areas, I had many meetings with representatives of the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science.  I met local authority managers in developing areas and we sat around the table to work out a series of protocols.  An excellent programme is being put in place.  For the first time local authorities in developing areas, or what we call hubs or gateways, are feeding information to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an accurate picture of what is happening, how much progress has been made, the number of houses and the anticipated population growth.  This is something that was not done previously but is now in the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

Higgins — to proceed with the development of Clifden community school, Scoil Phobail Clifden, in County Galway, in view of the fact that the school has been approved for progress and in the light of the increased local school going population, together with cramped and outdated working conditions and facilities in the school, in particular with regard to the united community voice calling for this development to proceed, and unanimity, too, among elected representatives as well as parents, pupils and voluntary groups in the area; (3) Deputy John O'Mahony — the need to review the case of a person in County Mayo who has been refused a respite care grant; (4) Deputy Frank Feighan — to ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, when radio iodine ablasion treatment will be made available to a 17 year old from Glenballythomas, Tulsk, County Roscommon, who had a malignant tumour removed from her thyroid gland in July 2007 at which stage, according to staff in University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG, plans were immediately put in place for her treatment; the reason she has not received this treatment to date; the reason this teenager, who cannot attend school due to her deteriorating health and anaemic condition, has been left ten months without treatment; and the person who removed her name from the waiting list in St. Luke's without her family's knowledge (details supplied); (5) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on his plans regarding the reopening of Killucan railway station in County Westmeath and the provision of Structural Funds financing for same in the light of the urgent need for easily accessible public transport due to the rapidly increasing population in the area;  (6) Deputy Ulick Burke — the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to include in the proposed new intoxicating liquor Bill a section that will ban the sale in Ireland of the highly potent and exclusively designed shot packs originating in Mexico which are packaged and designed for concealment in night clubs, concerts, sporting venues and are aimed at the teenage market; (7) Deputy Olwyn Enright — to ask the Minister for Education and Science how his Department can assist an eight year old autistic child who has been expelled from school to find a school place, following the failure of his appeal against expulsion and following unsuccessful attempts to have any other school in the area to take him as a pupil, and following attempts to get assistance from all relevant agencies to no avail. (details supplied); (8) Deputy Tom Hayes — to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government to discuss the approval and release of funds for a water investment programme in order to meet the critical shortage of infrastructure in south Tipperary; to particularly comment on the lack of service entirely, poor water pressure, poor quality, and dirty water received by many people across south Tipperary; to clarify how much has been allocated in south Tipperary water infrastructure this year, as well as nationally; to clarify how much has been spent on the Fethard scheme, the Tipperary scheme, the Clonmel scheme, the Cashel scheme, the Cahir scheme and the Carrick-on-Suir scheme; to outline the delays in the system nationally and explain why these still exist; and to make a statement on the matter; (9) Deputy Brian O'Shea — the need to reconsider the decision not to underwrite the €39 million loan for Waterford Wedgewood; (10) Deputy Dan Neville — Kilmallock sewerage scheme; (11) Deputy Michael Creed — the need to make provisions for late applications for the single farm payment; (12) Deputy Tom Sheahan — the decision to stop fishing around Cromane Bay; and (13) Deputy Mary Alexandra White — the need to reform the requirement of people aged 70 and over for full medical examinations when applying for new driving licences, the cost of which does not come within the remit of the GP medical card contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I note that section 26 of the Bill also outlines the Minister's ability to issue policy directions and guidelines to the Dublin transport authority, DTA.  I intend to insert a strong amendment here specifying the Minister's absolute responsibility to report to Members of the Oireachtas on all matters pertaining to the DTA.  As I said earlier, the Dublin transport authority must not be allowed to become another quango or a HSE on wheels.  The DTA will be a significant and powerful organisation with an enormous budget.  It will also have a vast transport, planning and socio-economic agenda.  It is imperative that the DTA and the Minister for Transport of the day are fully accountable to the Dáil and to their fellow citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">I accept that Part 2, section 41 establishes that the DTA must attend the Oireachtas transport committee and Committee of Public Accounts if requested to do so.  However, I strongly believe that political responsibility for the organisation must be fully accepted and acted upon by the Minister for Transport in the pre-eminent chamber of this House, the Dáil.  At present, the Minister is unaccountable for bodies such as the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I will attempt to amend this Bill to ensure he must answer to Dáil Éireann on all major issues of policy and performance with regard to the Dublin Transport Authority.  I hope the Minister will give a commitment to do this and that an initiative will be taken, in conjunction with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Ceann Comhairle, to ensure there are no more unaccountable quangos——</p>

          <p eId="para_815">——with madcap proposals for congestion charges, road pricing and banning cars from a wide area of central Dublin.  Traffic in Dublin and the greater Dublin area is on a constant knife edge and I welcome the provision that obliges the DTA to draw up and enforce a comprehensive traffic management plan and relevant guidelines following wide consultation with the local authorities and other stakeholders.  However, there is an even more pressing reason a comprehensive and strictly enforced traffic management scheme is increasingly vital to the greater Dublin area.  This is, of course, the proposed "big dig" for the metro north, the rail interconnector and the Luas link which, if not properly managed, could cause chaos and total gridlock in Dublin city centre.  We are all extremely worried because the Minister is the man on the bridge.  He is the man in charge of this potential traffic and socio-economic disaster.  The last time I asked parliamentary questions in the House, the Minister had a hysterical reaction when I questioned him on the big dig.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">The Labour Party has long been a strong supporter of fixed-rail projects, such as the metro north, the Luas link and the rail interconnector, and if I and my party had our way these projects would have been developed and delivered years ago for the people of the city and the greater Dublin and mid-Leinster region.  Yet there is major concern that mismanagement of the big dig could devastate business life in the city and cause an unprecedented level of congestion.  Earlier this week we heard the Dublin City Business Association making public its concerns that €2 billion per year could be lost to the Irish economy during the big dig.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I will meet the Dublin Chamber of Commerce later this week to discuss the concerns of local business people.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The experience of Sheffield, which the Minister of State will remember as he and I were city councillors at the time, is a case in point.  During the building of Sheffield's light rail system it was said that business life in the city centre was sterilised.  Such an outcome must be avoided at all costs.  I asked the Minister to clarify the impact of the big dig and what exactly will happen to the city.  We recently had an avalanche of sensational newspaper reports about the destruction of St. Stephen's Green and the removal of much-loved Dublin monuments, such as the statues of Daniel O'Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell, and, indeed, although I do not think it is much loved, the removal of the Spire.  The Minister must ensure a transparent process that keeps the public completely and absolutely informed of all developments and the full potential impact of the big dig as soon as possible.  That is why I believe the Bill should contain references to the big dig.  We should deal with it in the Bill and have provisions on how it is to be managed.  I will table amendments in this regard on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">In the context of traffic management, I hope the Minister will finally address the ongoing issue of the current tolling regime on the M50.  As the Minister knows, readers of the <i>Evening Herald</i> have been making their voices heard in their thousands on this issue.  The M50 fiasco is simply one of the worst and most costly deals for Irish taxpayers that has ever been agreed in the history of the State, costing us at least €600 million in the next 15 or 20 years.  Motorists believed that with the Government buy-out of the West Link bridge and the lifting of the barriers from next August, some relief was finally in sight, but instead they are being hit with a further price whammy and the prospect of ever-spiralling charges for using the motorway.  There is a great danger that motorists will try to avoid using the M50 if at all possible once the new charges are introduced, with the result that there will be a large increase in the number of drivers rat-running through residential neighbourhoods, including those in the Minister of State’s constituency and mine, and using the streets around the already clogged-up city centre.  Motorists should be encouraged to use the M50 more rather than less when the big dig begins.  Is this likely to happen with the imposition of higher toll charges in August?</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The Minister must now step in and fully review the operation of the present tolling regime before barrier-free tolling begins to operate in August.  The Minister previously discussed with me the proposals for and debates on congestion charges in New York and Sweden and the local referendums that were held on this issue.  Surely citizens in Dublin and throughout Ireland should have similar democratic rights.  I intend to propose that section 11 be amended to provide for local and regional referendums on all major traffic management issues.  Let the Minister put the issue to the people of Meath, Dublin, Kildare, Louth and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Part 5 of the Bill, which deals with land use provisions, is very timely and pertinent.  The reprehensible failure to properly integrate transport needs with commercial and residential developments has been one of the worst and most shameful failures of Irish public policy in the past decades.  Many high density developments were built without adequate transport links during the Celtic tiger years and citizens in new residential developments across Ireland have been left with an appallingly low level of public transport provision, if they have any at all, often for years on end.  Development after development was sanctioned with little thought, provision or enforcement throughout the mid-Leinster and wider regions.  In my constituency, as the Minister will remember, a proposal for a vast new urban centre on the north side was recently approved by the planning authority, Dublin City Council, which is a PPP partner of the developer.  This will provide for the astonishing number of nearly 1,400 apartment units and duplexes, plus 76,000 sq. m of retail space, in an area of Coolock that is already poorly served by public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">What is missing in this proposal?  No fixed-line transport system is planned, despite the fact that a north side Luas from Donaghmede to Ballymun and the airport was part of the DTO's 2016 plan which was laid out eight years ago.  In another part of my constituency, the famous north fringe, we have been waiting for a new DART station for the past six or seven years but it has been put off until mid-2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The Bill before us contains a series of valuable amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000, which are intended to ensure consistency between the authority's strategy and the various plans and guidelines produced by local and regional planning authorities in the greater Dublin area.  It appears, however, that county and local development plans will not have to obtain binding DTA approval in the absence of ministerial intervention under section 92.  I understand the distinguished Professor Margaret O'Mahony of Trinity College, the first head of the DTA establishment team, left the organisation because of the failure of the Government, particularly the former Minister, Deputy Cullen, to ensure that every local authority in the greater Dublin area was obliged to obtain DTA approval for all development plans to make sure they contained fully integrated transport plans.  I will submit amendments on this issue on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Chapter 3 of Part 5 provides for vital integration measures, including the sharing of ticketing systems, stops, stations and other infrastructure.  Fully integrated ticketing should have been operational by 2005.  Instead the completion date was pushed back to 2010 and then to 2013.  During this period the cost of integrated ticketing has also skyrocketed from the original figure of €29.6 million to at least €50 million.  The outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, issued a damning report that strongly criticised the management of the integrated ticketing project.  All this goes back to the fact that the Government failed to set up the Dublin Transport Authority in a timely manner.  I was reasonably heartened by a recent briefing given to the Joint Committee on Transport by the newly established integrated ticketing project board.  It is hoped we are finally on track to have an integrated ticketing system in two years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">One of the most critical factors in the failure to roll out integrated ticketing, as I mentioned, was the absence of an overarching organisation such as the DTA, which is absolutely essential to drive through all the integrated aspects of a modern transport system for Dublin.  Further integration measures proposed in Chapter 3 include an integrated public transport information system.  The legislation should mandate the DTA to drive the roll-out of a real-time integrated public transport information system.  The Minister of State may remember talking about this in 1991 in Dublin City Council and on the traffic committee with Dublin Bus.  There was talk of the possibility of showing bus information in real time on bus stops.  Here we are, 16 years later, and what have we got?</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, spoke extensively about the development by the DTA of a single public transport brand for the greater Dublin area and provision is made for that under section 57.  I welcome that but I would like a lot more information on it.  For example, how much will the rebranding exercise cost and will all transport providers, including public and private operators and rail, light rail and bus services, be included?  As expected, part 6 of the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Dublin Transportation Office and its incorporation into the new DTA.  I pay tribute to the work of the DTO, led by Mr. John Henry, the CEO, and Mr. Willie Soffe, the chairperson of the steering committee, a former Fingal County Manager who was also the transport manager of Dublin City Council for many years.  I pay tribute to the team on their work in recent years.  Although the DTO had a limited remit, the organisation has contributed significantly to developing and advancing transport policy in the greater Dublin area over the years.  I hope this good work will continue, especially as regards the development of long-term transport strategy.  I welcome the Bill's references to research and the provision of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I welcome the decision by the Minister to re-establish a Dublin transport authority and to publish this legislation.  The tenor of much of my speech may sound critical to the ears of the Ministers of State and the Minister, but the Labour Party and I are committed to developing and delivering a strong and sustainable transport network, with accessible public transport for all commuters in the greater Dublin area and across the country at its heart.  Given this legislation's long and difficult gestation, it could have been better and more comprehensive and democratic.  I intend to introduce a series of amendments on behalf of the Labour Party on Committee Stage to address the gaps and deficiencies I have outlined.  I hope the Minister of State will respond positively.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I welcome that the Bill addresses the requirement to consolidate all public transportation into one authority.  Commuters in my area and throughout the greater Dublin region are under pressure.  The authority will free our congested roads from the agencies charged with taking care of them, public transport and funding.  The Bill will ensure the overhauling of these aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The landscape of public transport in the greater Dublin area is changing with the advent of Transport 21, particularly in respect of metro north, DART extensions to Balbriggan and, hopefully, Drogheda in Deputy O'Dowd's constituency, more buses and additional park and ride facilities around the city and county.  As desired by each Deputy, the authority will be empowered to deliver on each of these promises.  Every Member would agree that streamlining the decision-making process is essential.  No Deputy in the greater Dublin area has not been frustrated by the current system, with its multi-agency confusion and ensuing indecision.  This mammoth Bill's most important aspect is the proposal to give decision-making powers to a single authority.  No single agency or Department has the same level of power.  The concentration of power and responsibility is vital for the effective and efficient running of the new authority and for the delivery of a reliable, integrated and efficient transport system for all citizens.  Since some 1.6 million people live in the region and more than 800,000 vehicles traverse the city's roads per day, resolving the outstanding issues in public transport and gridlock has never been more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The Bill's aim is to establish an agency with the power to deliver a cost-effective, efficient and integrated system.  To achieve this, it is necessary to empower the authority in an unprecedented way.  The DTA must and will be responsible for all strategic public transportation planning.  It must be the go-to agency on all planning matters.  I welcome the requirement for ministerial approval of all strategic planning, ensuring a healthy level of Government consultation.  Of prime importance is the plan to introduce a 12-20 year strategic plan for the greater Dublin area, including a six-year implementation plan to set out a pathway for the commencement of the larger strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I welcome the authority's role as the main procurement agency for infrastructure not already under the remit of the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA.  Other powers include responsibility for allocating capital for public transport initiatives, traffic management and the regulation of fares.  Another important aspect of the Bill is the power given to the authority to seek standards in the delivery of services by the transport providers and the power to act against any agency should those standards not be met.  Similarly, the DTA will have the power to intervene if an agency is not delivering on its public transportation project commitments.  The DTA will be able to step in if transportation planning guidelines are not adhered to by local authorities.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Transport, I look forward to debating this issue as we move to the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The delivery and implementation of Transport 21 should and will be a priority for the new authority.  Let us not underestimate the importance of Transport 21.  A €34 billion project will deliver seven new Luas lines, more buses, DART extensions northwards and a new metro system, north and west.  As a Deputy representing Dublin North, I am excited by the metro development.  While I am aware that the delivery of metro north will remain under the remit of the RPA for continuity purposes, its operation should fall under the new authority's aegis once it has been completed.  For now, metro north is included in Transport 21 and belongs to any debate pertaining to the DTA.  For the first time, passengers will be able to get on a metro at St. Stephen's Green and travel to Dublin Airport in less than 20 minutes.  Another few minutes would bring them to Swords in my area.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">The Deputy would not need that help.  He has two quotas.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Of primary importance is the linking of regular Dublin Bus services — I would describe them as Nipper services — from large housing estates with various metro and DART stops.  It will revolutionise the legendary Dublin North, Louth, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare commutes and reverse our constituents' daily reliance on cars to get into the city.  In recent weeks, the RPA issued tender documents to four preferred bidders.  I look forward to the awarding of the contract at an early date.  I also look forward to the issuing of the railway order in autumn and I hope that the project will go to construction in 2010.  To highlight the benefits of the metro, one should imagine going from one's house by foot or short bus trip to the local metro or DART station and arriving in town within 30 minutes of leaving home.  I look forward to it.  Hopefully, I will still be coming to Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The DART system will be extended northwards from Malahide to Balbriggan and beyond, allowing for swifter and more regular journeys for commuters.  I hope that the expansion will cater for all of the coastal communities of Dublin North and beyond.  The region has experienced significant population expansion, most of which occurred in Dublin North.  The populations of Donabate and Lusk will grow to a projected 20,000 each, the population of Rush to 15,000, the population of Skerries to 20,000 and the population of Balbriggan to 25,000.  The extension of the DART system is essential for those communities and others northwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">With the expansion comes the need for more DART and mainline carriages.  The authority must be briefed on the need for more carriages as the DART network is extended.  It is important that the rail service is supplemented by the provision of a large network of buses in surrounding areas.  Additional bus services are needed to cater for the growing populations in north Dublin and the surrounding counties in the greater Dublin area.  These are areas that probably will not be serviced by rail in the future.  Therefore, bus transport will play an important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Another of the authority's functions will be the power to relate contracts for rail and bus provision to ongoing performance and service standards.  This will ensure that best value is achieved for the taxpayer.  The authority will also have powers to intervene and take action on a project should a particular transport agency not act on its direction.  I will be relieved when Transport 21, which is a major undertaking, comes under the direction of the new authority.  The authority will then be capable of implementing an integrated plan so as to streamline the city's transport system into one of the finest in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">One of the most attractive elements of the proposed Dublin transport authority will be its facilitation of the integration of the public transport system.  It is important that a brand akin to those with which we are familiar in London, Paris and New York is created.  We must make sure that people are aware of the steps being taken towards the integration of the system.  Once executed, integration will allow commuters to switch seamlessly between bus, rail and Luas.  In line with this, it is important that we create an integrated information system that allows passengers to plan and discover the cost of their journey, on any or all modes of transport, in a matter of seconds.  For example, the Transport for London website includes live updates, bus, tube and national rail timetables and traffic updates for road users and offers users the opportunity to sign up to live mobile telephone alerts.  The site also provides an efficient journey planner where commuters enter their start and final destinations and are presented with an array of travel options.  There are significant benefits for commuters and tourists in offering such a comprehensive information system.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">An important aspect of the integration of public transport services will be the provision of park and ride facilities at various locations in the city.  This will allow more motorists from areas beyond the conventional public transport catchment zones to avail of whatever mode of transport the park and ride facility services.  In my area, people in north Dublin and south Meath will be able to use the proposed metro north park and ride facility at Swords-Lissenhall.  It is important that this facility is constructed without delay, well in advance of the completion of metro north.  It will help to relieve much of the current congestion in the area.  I hope the Dublin transport authority will also provide for a regular bus service from the Swords-Lissenhall park and ride facility to the city via the Dublin Port tunnel.  It is important to offer commuters as many transportation options as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">An issue of great importance to my constituents in Swords is the 41X Dublin Bus service.  Other Deputies may not appreciate the significant impact which the issues with this service are having on commuters in Swords.  Will the Minister of State ensure, once the Bill is enacted, that legislation is brought forward to reform the Road Transport Act 1932?  Under the provisions of this legislation, Dublin Bus is forbidden from using the port tunnel.  This licensing issue has held up the efficient operation of the 41X service, affecting thousands of commuters on a daily basis.  Allowing Dublin Bus to use the port tunnel would save at least half an hour of commuting time at peak hours.  It is easy to understand the frustration and confusion of commuters that a decision on this issue should rely on such outdated legislation.  This must be sorted out as soon as possible, with or without the involvement of the Dublin transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">It is important the Dublin transport authority addresses the issue of usage by other motorists of the Dublin Port tunnel.  I have raised this issue several times at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.  It is currently prohibitively expensive for motorists to use the tunnel even though it remains substantially empty for long periods of the day.  I restate my suggestion that we consider imposing the same usage rates for motorists as apply in the case of the M50.  It is not in the interests of avoiding congestion to channel traffic to two main arteries in the city when we have a fantastic element of infrastructure such as the tunnel.  I do not share the NRA's concerns about avoiding congestion in the tunnel.  That aspect can be well managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Although I have concentrated on public transport provision, it is important to consider the necessary improvements in the road network.  Road transport will remain a substantial element of the transport system.  Some Members may suggest that road building should be forsaken in favour of a concentration on the public transport system.  I disagree with the assertion that the two strands of infrastructural development cannot take place side by side.  No matter how good the public transport system in my area and many other areas, there will always be a significant reliance on roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">At Dublin Airport, which is in my constituency, incoming tourists hire cars as they leave the airport and cabs transport others into town.  For the thousands of people working in the tourism industry, road building is especially important.  The primary mode of transport for tourists is car hire.  Good roads are vital for the expansion of our economy.  One of the reasons that the north Dublin-Meath-Louth region has experienced such rapid economic growth is the M1 motorway.  The quality of the roads in the vicinity of the airport and leading into the city is extremely important.  Road building should be one of the priorities of the Dublin transport authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Strategic planning is important in all this.  I particularly welcome the requirement by the authority for developers to provide transport impact assessments.  Of equal importance is the requirement on local authorities to ensure these assessments are satisfactory and consistent with the authority's strategic approach.  Planning must be brought to the fore by local authorities throughout the region to ensure that no future development is completed without incorporating the policies set out in the Dublin transport authority strategy.  The authority must support the NRA in its road building endeavours, especially in view of the recent road safety report which observed that motorways are safer than single lane roads.  This emphasises the importance of a modern road network for Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Upgrading work is ongoing on the M50 and many of us have driven on the new section south of the toll bridge.  It is a pleasure to drive on three-lane carriageways.  However, I am struck by the apparent lack of three lane driving experience on the part of some motorists.  A public information campaign on three-lane motorway driving might be useful, along the same lines as the television campaign to raise awareness of other aspects of good driving such as correct overtaking and proper signalling.  The Minister might put this suggestion to the Dublin transport authority once it is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">On the composition of the authority, I welcome the inclusion of county councillors and county managers.  These people have unparalleled knowledge of the needs of their communities.  I also welcome the provision obliging the authority to be accountable to the Minister.  This is essential in terms of offering public representatives the opportunity to question the authority on its activities and policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I am not opposed in theory to the proposed ban on private cars in Dublin city centre.  However, the experience in London suggests there may be difficulties here.  The extension of the Luas, the development of the metro system and the provision of additional buses will enhance our public transport options.  They will have to be in place before we can consider the banning of cars on O'Connell Street, College Green or Dame Street.  It is essential that we provide proper public transport first.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I welcome the DTO's proposal on traffic management during the construction of the metro and reject Deputy Broughan's reference to social disaster.  An omelette cannot be made without breaking eggs.  We need the management of Dublin City Council to come up with a traffic plan but I want to see the metro built even though it will undoubtedly cause inconvenience.  I experienced the difficulties that arose during the construction of the M1 motorway but that proved to be a wonderful piece of infrastructure at the end of the day, and I have no doubt that the metro will be the same.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_603">
          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this long-awaited Bill.  For a number of years, the absence of a body to pull together the diverse and often competing providers of infrastructure, public transport, traffic management and policing has been a major source of frustration to everybody who lives or does business in Dublin.  Public representatives from Dublin cannot but be obsessed about the traffic congestion that has been part of our lives for so many years.   We all recognise the need to bring together these agencies to provide a co-ordinated, integrated and coherent public transport plan which is seamlessly delivered, and to that extent I welcome the publication of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">We have waited many years for this authority and the present Bill represents the third attempt to establish a body that would provide coherence to transport in Dublin.  The first body was abolished in 1987 by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  That was followed by the Dublin transportation initiative, which led to the establishment 15 years ago of the Dublin Transportation Office.  While most of the expertise and evidence based policy formulation in the transport area resides in that body, it never fulfilled the role for which it was originally envisaged.  It simply did not have the necessary powers and so remained a policy body, albeit one that is widely respected for the independence and objectivity of its views and public utterances, even when observers disagree with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">This failure to establish a body to co-ordinate traffic has had a heavy price and Dublin residents, workers and businesses have suffered.  The inability to control congestion has impacted significantly on the rising cost of doing business in the country's capital and in no small way contributed to our current economic woes.  There has been no co-ordination in the planning or delivery of the projects which were commenced.  Single projects were poorly co-ordinated and often overlapped.  The absence of a body to drive delivery of projects resulted in their failure in many cases.  Infighting, jealousy, self-interest, turf wars and futile competition between the agencies responsible for Dublin traffic ensured zero progress and little integration or co-operation.  It is vital that the new authority does not depend on mere moral suasion, which does not work when self interest is at stake.  As a member of the advisory body to the DTO and a former local authority representative, I witnessed with despair the competition that took place between various providers and agencies and the turf wars whose sole victims were the travelling public.  Lack of agreement meant we could not have integrated ticketing or private buses and that buses and Luas could not run on the same road.  There has been an absence of common purpose between the agencies and they have failed to recognise their role in serving the public.  It was as if they were self serving entities.  This Bill attempts to create unity of purpose but a common logo is not enough to make the agencies co-operate.  Strong powers are needed to bring them together, kicking and screaming if necessary, to pursue the public good.  Perhaps it is human nature that the private interests of the various players are put before the public interest but it is the Government's responsibility to tip the balance in favour of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">For many years I have called for the establishment of this authority, so I am disappointed that I have to make two major criticisms of the proposals before us, namely, the Minister for Transport's capitulation on the introduction of competition to the Dublin bus market and the proposed authority's lack of accountability to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Once this body is established, it will become another HSE in terms of its lack of accountability.  It should be inconceivable to Deputies, particularly those who represent the greater Dublin area, that after this Bill is enacted we will never be able to have a question answered on Dublin Bus, metro, Luas, DART or any other transport project, despite the fact that we are going to spend billions of euro on projects which will dominate our streets for many years to come.  We will be unable to get an answer to parliamentary questions or raise these issues in the Dáil.  I simply cannot vote for such a proposal.  Much as I want to see a Dublin transportation authority, it has to be accountable.  A body cannot spend huge sums or make vital decisions on behalf of 40% of the country's population without effective reporting structures and accountability for its policy and performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The Minister has suggested the establishment of an advisory body to introduce an element of accountability.  I have been a member of advisory bodies and have seen them in action.  As a member of the Dublin transportation advisory body, I found it to be an absolute farce.  The agencies came, listened to what the director had to say and then squabbled with each other.  It was not democratic and it certainly did not improve accountability.  Any public representative who cares about the future of Dublin and its transport system or has an interest in seeing the system improved could not support an agency possessing this kind of power in the absence of accountability before the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">My second disappointment concerns the future of the bus service.  One of the great hopes we have had for this body was that it would be the mechanism to regulate bus competition and award contracts to competing operators.  It is an outrage that the Minister has capitulated on this matter.  The only interest he is serving is that of Dublin Bus and its workers.  I understand that the job of Dublin Bus and its unions is to protect workers but it is the Minister's job to protect members of the public who need to get to work in the morning.  Irrespective of whether one has a private car, one's interest is best served by the improved capacity and services that only competition can bring.  Vesting a regulatory function in the authority would ensure that competition did not become counterproductive or a free-for-all, yet the Minister has reneged on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">He has promised to reform the 1932 Act but even if he follows through on his word he will merely confirm the primacy of Dublin Bus and its ownership of all existing routes.  Subsidies to the company have substantially increased in recent years even though its daily carrying figures are static.  Regulated bus competition has been promised by three successive Ministers and the previous Minister even promised 200 buses for the private sector, as well as subventions for uneconomic routes.  These commitments seem to have disappeared into the ether of the last election.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Minister made much of the inclusion in the legislation of EU public service obligations and he promised to introduce public service contracts whereby subventions would be linked to performance.  However, these contracts are, if not meaningless, certainly far less effective when there is no real sanction for failure to perform.  If a service provider does not perform to the required standard and if buses are not provided with the frequency and regularity required, there should at least be a threat that its contract will be discontinued and given to another provider.  In the absence of such a sanction, there is no incentive to perform.  The worst that can happen is that Dublin Bus will receive a lower subvention the following year.  Who will suffer then?  The only possible outcome will be the provision of an even worse service for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The public's interests come behind those of the agency charged with providing the service.  At the very least, the Dublin transport authority should be enabled to source alternative providers in circumstances where the contract performance on the part of Dublin Bus is sub-optimal.  This is a still a long way from competitive public tendering but at least the type of threat to which I refer might make some difference in the context of the standard of service to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Other areas have been neglected in the Bill, including the need for some kind of representation on the board or some kind of input from bodies such as Dublin Port and the Dublin Airport Authority.  These are both vital pieces of infrastructure generating huge quantities of traffic and both fundamentally important to the Dublin and indeed the national economy.  Their requirements and their view points should form part not only of the strategy, but of the implementation plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I support and welcome many aspects of the Bill.  I refer, for example, to the genuine attempt to ensure co-ordination among the national spatial strategy, county development plans, local development plans and the authority's own plans.  This is absolutely crucial in the long term if we are to achieve the kind of co-ordination and sustainability to which we aspire.  However, it remains to be seen whether the measures will actually work.  The Minister will be obliged to monitor progress and he should not be slow to intervene if there is clear conflict and inconsistency among the various plans.  In saying this, I am conscious that previous Ministers did not move to ensure consistency between the national spatial strategy and county development plans.  We will all pay for that failure in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I welcome the decision to integrate the functions of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the new body.  The taxi industry in the Dublin area is clearly part of the overall transport network and it should be regulated by the authority.  A strong central body is required to deal with the taxi industry, particularly in the aftermath of suggestions that there is an over-supply of taxis in the city.  It should, however, be clear to the authority that if such an over-supply exists, it is related to the high fares that can be commanded by those in the industry.  There is an obvious solution in this regard.  The primary interest of the regulator must be the consumer and not the provider of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The correct approach is being taken by the Minister in leaving the CIE group, Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann and the RPA as independent agencies.  On the other hand, the Dublin Transportation Office is to be subsumed into the new authority.  The DTO possesses a vast amount of experience and expertise in transport modelling and empiricism.  The DTO can provide validity to the agencies projects because it is respected as the only independent body with that kind of expertise in analysis.  As we make a new beginning, it is important to ensure that this expertise is not dissipated.  As a policy body, the DTO should be subsumed into the new authority and should act as a regulator in respect of independent service providers such as the RPA and Dublin Bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">What is not clear is the new authority's strategic plan and its implementation plans in respect of projects that have already been announced under Transport 21.  Will the promised projects relating to Transport 21 to be re-evaluated, re-prioritised, dropped altogether or increased in number?  As activity in the construction industry begins to flag, particularly in the area of housing development, it is vital to sustain capital investment.  These badly needed transport projects are the ideal vehicle to minimise the impact of the reduction in house-building activity.  Activity in this area will help to retain vital workers and deliver valuable and long overdue projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I wish to be parochial by mentioning one of the projects which appears to have been dropped from the original proposals in A Platform for Change to extend Luas to the Rathfarnham area.  There is a gap in the planned transport network which encompasses the entire area between Dundrum and Firhouse-Knocklyon.  If one looks at a map, it is obvious that this is the only area which will not be serviced.  A feasibility study was promised during a previous election campaign.  However, this was only carried out in respect of the route which it had already been decided was not viable.  It appears, as expected, that the route is still not viable, particularly because there is too much congestion on the streets in the area.  It is farcical that this excuse is being given.  The fact that there is traffic congestion indicates an urgent need for the provision of some link to the transport network.  This should not prove to be beyond human ingenuity.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The matter to which I refer should be reconsidered.  Due to the narrowness of the streets and the congestion that exists, it is impossible to provide a decent bus service.  Regardless of the number of buses provided, the road simply cannot take them.  I ask that the new authority examine this matter at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">There are several vital issues to which consideration must be given at an early stage.  Effectively, these issues have proven to be too hot to handle for the existing agencies and the Government.  Transport 21 is, in effect, a list of unintegrated projects and that sort of decision making must stop.   It was decision making of this nature that gave us the port tunnel, which took on a life of its own and proceeded even after the decision to drop its continuation into an eastern bypass of the city.  It is almost evitable that the latter will proceed at some stage; otherwise, we will have built a tunnel that effectively runs into a cul de sac.  No matter how one describes it, this has proven to be the case.  The port tunnel is totally under-utilised, with spare capacity at all times of the day and night.  This is so because there is a need for demand management due to the fact that the tunnel runs into the cul de sac to which I refer in Dublin Port.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">It is not a defence to say that projects of this nature are not built to reach full capacity on day one.  This project will never reach full capacity, particularly with its current configuration and the pricing regime relating to it.  I am not saying that the city would be better off without the tunnel.  The city might, however, have been better off if a different solution had been put forward, particularly when the decision had been made to drop the eastern bypass.  That is all history.  A promise was made during the 1997 election campaign to the effect that the eastern bypass was off the agenda.  The latter no longer appears to be the case and in the past seven years no fewer than three feasibility studies were carried out in respect of this matter.  However, no one has grasped the nettle and decided what will happen.  Is the bypass to proceed?  Someone must make a decision in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The decision to which I refer must be made in the context of other projects relating to the south side of the city.  If, for example, an incinerator is to be built at Ringsend, how will it be serviced?  The two major bailing stations for the region are also located on the south side of the city and these will have to be moved to Ringsend if the incinerator is built.  Also relevant is the possibility that Dublin Port will be moved.  It defies belief that the Government proceeded to spend almost €1 billion on the construction of a tunnel to serve a port that might be relocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">These decisions to which I refer and plans for their implementation must be made with speed and in the context of an overall and coherent transport strategy for Dublin.  Discussion about the building of alternative bridges to facilitate metro work has come much too late.  I have been speaking about this matter in the House and outside for many years.  The division of the city into its north-side and south-side areas has been the subject of many jokes.  However, this has been made a reality by the inability or refusal on the part of the Dublin City Council to provide additional bridges over the River Liffey.  The Macken Street bridge, which is finally under construction, should have been completed ten years ago.  What prospect is there of additional bridges, temporary or otherwise, being in place to facilitate metro work or the removal of all traffic from O'Connell St.?  There is also the question of whether the metro will be completed within our lifetimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">It will be the job of the new authority to drive the projects to which I refer.  It must be given the power to force local authorities, in the context of projects with which they are proceeding, to facilitate projects undertaken by other agencies — such as metro or Luas — regardless of whether they want or approve of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">One of the criticisms I would level at the Bill as it stands is that the DTA does not appear to have the power to direct the local authorities to perform.  While reference is made to transport service providers being required to perform to a certain standard, a similar requirement is not being put in place in respect of local authorities.  Such a requirement is essential.  Bridges and road connections are a vital part of the transport system's infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">There are other matters which have been neglected in the Bill.  There is a need for representation on the new authority from the Dublin Port Company and the Dublin Airport Authority.  I do not know if those responsible for the port or the airport have been consulted in respect of the Bill.  However, these are vital items of infrastructure and they are responsible for generating huge volumes of traffic.  Both are fundamentally important to Dublin and the national economy.  The points of view of the representatives of both bodies to which I refer should form not only part of the strategy, but also the ongoing implementation plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The four Dublin local authorities and the three outer counties which form the greater Dublin area are now significant traffic destinations as well as traffic generators.  The office of the director of traffic, which has been based in Dublin City Council, should be subsumed into the new authority.  This office undoubtedly has been very effective in managing traffic in the city, although this has been at the expense of the rest of the region.  It has introduced a system of queuing at the boundary which has not helped traffic in the rest of the greater Dublin area.  From now on, the greater Dublin area must be treated as a coherent whole and not simply as a city centre with traffic problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The remit of the traffic director must include the greater Dublin area operating not from one local authority base, but the new body in the interests of the entire area.  If we were to be honest about the traffic problems of the city centre, they are much less than those of the suburbs now.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">It is not mentioned in the legislation but bodies such as the quality bus network office may be subsumed as part of the DTA.  It certainly should come under the remit of the new body.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">I may find it impossible to support something I have long called for simply because of its lack of accountability to the Dáil.  In all honesty, no Dublin representative can vote for a HSE for transport, finding themselves with their hands tied behind their backs and never again being able to raise an issue concerning the metro, Luas or Dublin Bus in this House, or have any kind of a debate or answer to a question.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_884">I came initially to this debate simply to sit in and take the ministerial place but it is a critical debate.  I will take up the last point made by Deputy Mitchell because she made a very interesting and rich contribution.  I do not say this in a patronising sense because I listened to her contribution with great interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">As the Deputy noted, we are always divided in two directions in this House, with one direction the creation of agencies that can work and the other ensuring that we do not have agencies created outside the remit of democratic accountability.  I agree with the general thesis that there have been far too many people on all sides of the House — none of us is blame-free — who have called over the years for the establishment of quangos to do this and that.  I would personally be quite willing to support a fairly radical hunt.  That does not come from today or yesterday as I have had the view for many years.  Agencies, when established, should have a specific life span subject to review and culling as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Deputy would accept that the concept of a transport authority where we could have parliamentary questions on when the Luas broke down or the 84 bus did not run, etc., would go that little bit too far.  Democratic accountability is very important, which I accept absolutely, particularly in terms of the overriding necessity to keep control on public expenditure and general performance.  If the Deputy and her party were to give further consideration to the final point she made in a very fine contribution, she would see there is a certain impracticality there.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">It is interesting to consider the debate over the years and at the very early stages of the State, particularly the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government, when there were some very fine debates on establishing public authorities which have business acumen, drive and efficiency and which are not fettered by excessive degrees of parochialism, which inevitably becomes part and parcel of politics.  On the other hand, the authorities are kept in general control.  The commercial State-sponsored bodies were the result of a long debate aimed at achieving such a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The Deputy may agree that one of the problems has been that boards have not exercised sufficient control over the years.  I was particularly attracted to her absolutely correct comments on turf wars and the failure of people in some public service agencies to see their objective as just that — public service.  We must re-examine this issue.  I do not agree with the Deputy that the Minister is taking a wrong step but there is a core of an important point here, which is how we establish public service agencies and ensure public service obligation and delivery is to the fore in those agencies, rather than careers or personal ambitions of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The requirement for a Dublin transport authority has been discussed in this House for many years.  It is clear the time has long since come for us to have an operational agency.  A very small team under Professor O'Mahony in Trinity College produced a very good report in March 2006 and the Government approved the drafting of legislation shortly afterwards.  Other events intervened.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">In accordance with the commitment in Towards 2016, the report of the team was published in November 2006 and there was then a period of public consultation during which submissions could be made.  The proposals put before the House by the Minister are informed not just by a very rigorous academic study as to what is the appropriate way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The study conclusions generally would be in accordance with Deputy Mitchell's own conclusions in this particular area, as well as those of many of us on all sides.  It was also improved by the process of public consultation and the vigour that the Minister has brought to this issue.  As we know, the Minister lives in one of the constituencies around the commuter belt, which extends from Cavan to the Wexford border.  It is a substantial area.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The mandate, remit and functional area of the new authority will cover not just Dublin city and council, but Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, south Dublin and the surrounding counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  It is very important we approach the issue of transportation and physical planning in that substantial metropolis.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I also take the view that giving the DTA overall responsibility for all surface transport in the area is a good move.  As the Minister put it when he introduced the Bill, the objective is to ensure the people living and working in the greater Dublin area will in future have a high-quality integrated transport system that meets their needs in a sustainable way.  That is an issue in which we have a unity of purpose in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">A significant amount of every commuter's day is now spent in increasing frustration.  The issue is not just about infrastructure.  I can never quite grasp the reason there is a pathological incapacity to drive in Irish people.  Unfortunately, I have no choice about driving because of ministerial duties but on the journey most days, the standard of driving I witness on the roads is absolutely unbelievable.  It is not just a question of physical capacity on the roads, but a physical inability to make decisions which makes a contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">It is not always learner drivers at fault — very frequently it is not them.  A point was made by a previous speaker that some better public information on how to drive on a road would not go astray.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">To return to the main purpose of the Bill, I very much welcome the idea that we will, for the first time, bring this area into better focus.  It is an astonishing reality that over 7,000 sq. km are contained in the area covered by the Bill.  Almost 40% of the State's population, or 1.7 million people, are living in that area, with an extraordinary and phenomenal figure for vehicle registrations there.  There are close to 850,000 vehicles which, along with their hapless drivers, must travel tens of millions of miles every week.  The total direct and indirect cost to the community, environment and industry is very significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">This Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation, in terms of quality of life, to come before this Dáil.  As as we become economically more progressive — we have become wealthier in many ways and we have seen an explosion of car ownership — if people do not have efficient, effective, clean and properly operational public transport services, they will inevitably use the conveniences of their own vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The Bill gives the new DTA a very wide remit, focusing on delivery and integration of services.  The launch of Transport 21 in November 2005 was an important first step, but it was not the ultimate step.  Transport 21 provided a substantial transport infrastructure budget — €34 billion — for the first time.  It was critically important that such moneys were earmarked for the development of public transport.  The lack of available resources in the past meant that all transport investment was made on a stop-go basis.  One cannot develop rail transport and flexible bus systems in such a manner.  Commitment like that provided under Transport 21 is necessary if light rail systems, such as tramways, are to be developed.  I do not blame any earlier Government when I say that money was not available in the past.  We simply did not have the resources that were needed.  The allocation of a major multi-annual ring-fenced transport investment budget was a critical step, but it is not the only step that needs to be taken.  It ended years of stop-go investment that made it impossible to develop the kind of infrastructure we needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The next important step is being taken in this legislation.  One might argue that the Bill is timely or overdue, depending on one's viewpoint.  The Bill gives us considerable reason to be optimistic about the future.  The Minister for Transport has outlined the policy priorities that inform the legislation.  We can all agree with the priorities in question.  The first objective of the Bill is to ensure that Transport 21 is implemented in a timely and cost-effective manner.  We need to ensure that €34 billion of taxpayers' money is spent in a way that delivers value for money for each euro.  I am glad the Bill will produce measurable and time-related targets.  That is critical.  Any authority that is put in place will need to have a strict remit.  We will have to make clear what is expected of it.  Its targets will have to be set out in objective time-related terms.  Measures will have to be taken if targets are not reached.  Members on all sides of the House recognise such realities.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I would like to make a point that is relevant to this House and to politics in general.  It relates to the point I made to Deputy Mitchell at the outset.  I was not trying to score points.  If we are to have the type of public transport arrangements we need, we will need to stand back a little from more parochial issues.  We will have to set specific timeframes and targets for the authority.  We need to be prepared to judge its work in the totality rather than on a day-to-day basis.  I take issue with Deputy Mitchell in this respect.  If the Minister were directly answerable, some of the business focus that is needed might be lost.  It is possible to have the business focus that is needed while providing for answerability.  Public service agencies should be more willing to provide personnel to attend Oireachtas committee meetings from time to time.  As the Minister said, the idea of optimising the benefits which arise from the almost twofold increase in transport investment is to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Bill aims to bring physical and transport planning together.  We all accept that some appalling physical planning decisions were made in the past.  We need a breakthrough in this area and the Bill provides us with that.  It is vital that public authorities play as a team.  Deputy Mitchell was right to say that public authorities do not play as a team.  We have encountered sub-optimisation as a result of ridiculous turf wars.  There has been a lack of co-operation between public service agencies.  Deputies on the other side of the House will be aware of the turf wars between councils when it comes to providing services to areas which are contiguous to each other.  Louth, Meath and Fingal county councils, for example, have encountered problems when trying to provide water and sanitary services across borders.  Some public authorities act as if they own certain services.  They do not own them — they operate them on behalf of the citizens we represent in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The Bill represents an important move forward in this regard.  It will help to overcome some of the sub-optimisation problems I have mentioned.  The question of whether the problems associated with sub-optimisation and turf wars can be solved will depend on the officials who are put in place.  That point was well made by Deputy Mitchell.  If those who are put in charge of these matters have entrenched attitudes, it will be hard for them to make the changes which are needed.  It is not just a question of rebadging — it will also be a question of refocusing.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The Dublin transport authority will have overall responsibility for strategic transport planning.  It will have to undertake such work in close co-operation with the local authorities.  The Minister has made the point that such co-operation will be complemented by the enhancement of the power of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to intervene.  When I held that position, I was less than happy with the level of co-operation between public authorities.  I was not pleased by the manner in which planning was handled within local authorities from time to time.  I had to tell one council, which will remain nameless, that I intended to——</p>

I also put in train the steps which my successor brought to fruition in Monaghan to ensure there was some rationality in planning.  We have to accept that there have been tensions within the planning system.  Councillors want to facilitate and support local development, while at the same time——</p>

          <p eId="para_913">I should not respond to such comments.  I accept the chastisement.  We all accept that there has been woeful sub-optimisation in physical and transport planning.  The proposal to establish a Dublin transport authority to take the lead role in bringing the two sides of planning together represents a major step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">I am pleased that the authority will have the power to regulate transport fares and ensure that integrated ticketing, fares and information systems are delivered.  Over a decade has passed since I spoke at an Oireachtas committee meeting about the need for integrated ticketing.  I cannot understand why we do not have integrated ticketing.  This is a good example of a turf war.  There is no logic to the current situation.  We have been far too tolerant of misbehaviour and sub-optimal management in the CIE group on this issue.  It is amazing that one can go to Paris, buy a <i>carnet</i> of ten tickets and use them at any stage.  The Parisian authorities look at it in a progressive way.  They are happy to get one’s cash upfront.  One can use one’s <i>carnet</i> at any stage in the future.  It completely eludes me why a public transport agency like the CIE group has been unable to introduce a similar system over the years.  I hope the authority will make progress with this issue quickly.  I accept the point that this system needs to apply to the Luas network and the private operators as well the CIE group.  It has to be introduced.  If we are to get people to leave their cars at home, particularly when they are taking short journeys, we have to give them a chance to use the maximum number of public transport facilities.  The best way to do that is to have a simple integrated ticketing system.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">One of the responsibilities of the Dublin transport authority will be strategic traffic management planning, which is sub-optimal at present.  I have to drive through the territories of three local authorities to get to this House.  It is bizarre that different rules apply to bus lanes, to take a simple example, in the three areas.  I do not understand why the bus lanes in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area are closed to cars 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dick Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_917">We do not need bus lanes 24 hours a day.  By contrast, bus lane restrictions in the Dublin City Council area are confined to times of busy transportation levels.  I do not understand the logic that informs such different approaches.  These problems are not confined to bus lanes, incidentally.  As one drives from one local authority area to another, one can observe the recent phenomenon of a proliferation of poles on every single road in the country.  Anybody driving along Northumberland Road should count the number of signs that have been put up there.  There is a different signage arrangement in the next local authority area.  There needs to be rationality brought across the range, which can only be done by the type of integrated approach the Minister is proposing in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The Government is committed to radical improvement in public transport services in the GDA.  I do not believe it is unique to Government.  It is a commitment all in this House share.  Notwithstanding the validity of some of the comments made by Deputy Mitchell, it is very important that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.  The Bill has a considerable amount to commend it.  It is not a false dawn but the start of some hope for transport users in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">In my last minute I will be parochial.  The model of the NRA is being used here.  Having failed to persuade the NRA to be a little more attentive to maintenance on the new superb motorways it has opened, can it at least attend to the weeds on one or two of them, particularly those that go through the garden of Ireland?</p>

        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_617">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_920">As a Dublin Deputy I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and fully support Deputy Fergus O'Dowd's motion before the House that the Bill should not be passed in its present form as there will be a severe lack of accountability in the operation of the Dublin transport authority if it is.  My party is very fearful that by passing the Bill in its current form we will be party to setting up yet another super-quango which would be unaccountable to any Member of this House and might end up out of control like the HSE.  This is the last thing we on this side of the House want to see happen.  We must learn from the big mistakes that have been made regarding the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The Bill needs to be changed urgently.  We want to see accountability and transparency from the new body.  After all this Bill will remove planning and operational decisions relating to transport from the Minister for Transport.  We want the Minister to answer parliamentary questions on topics relating to the work of the Dublin transport authority within deadlines as other Ministers do.  We do not want the Minister to be able to refuse to answer questions by stating that it is a responsibility of the DTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">I note the DTA will consist of a chairperson and nine members appointed by the Minister for Transport.  However, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport should have a say in the appointment of members to the DTA board, as will be the case with the new broadcasting authority of Ireland Bill.  Those potential appointees to the board should be called before the Oireachtas committee and questioned about their suitability before they are appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">As there are currently 16 separate bodies involved in delivering public transport to the citizens of Dublin, it is no wonder that in the past ten years the city has ground to a halt.  The average speed in Dublin has crawled down to 14 km/h, which is slower than a horse and cart.  Our city suffers from chronic traffic congestion which is costing it at least €650 million every year and probably much more.  There is no integration between transport services because of the politics involved in the various bodies.  While I welcome the proposal to distil these 16 bodies down to one, the Bill cannot be supported in its current format.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">My own party recognised way back in 1986 that a co-ordinated approach was needed in this area.  The then Minister for Transport, the late former Deputy Jim Mitchell, set up a Dublin Transport Authority to prevent fragmentation of services.  However, the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 scrapped the authority as part of its cutbacks.  Looking back, while it might have been done with the best of intentions, it has certainly cost us all greatly both in financial and qualify of life terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">A new Dublin transport authority has been promised for 11 years.  However, a Bill has only come before the Oireachtas in the past few weeks.  The Bill was rushed through the Seanad in two weeks, which was too quickly given that it will establish such a powerful organisation.  Members should be given time to digest and debate the Bill adequately.  I am concerned about that and am also disappointed that the proposed new authority will only be set up on a statutory basis with effect from 1 January 2009, which is in seven months time.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I find it bizarre that the current projects such as the metro, the interconnector and new Luas lines which are already under way will not be monitored by the authority.  Is it wise that this new authority will not oversee the construction of the largest infrastructural projects in the history of the State?  Instead the RPA is monitoring these projects.  Why is the RPA not being absorbed into the Dublin transport authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The Minister for Transport promised the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, that a directly elected mayor of Dublin would be the automatic chairman of the DTA board but has now reneged on that promise which is of concern.  At least with a directly elected mayor there would be some accountability regarding the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">It is stated that 60% of people in the greater Dublin area rely on the car to get to work, because in many cases there is no public transport alternative.  Just 15% of commuters use the bus, with less than 9% utilising rail services.  In my constituency of Dublin North East there is not a proper transport service that services all the residents' needs.  There are not enough buses and some of the routes could be improved upon.  There was promise in the past of a Luas service passing through Coolock and servicing the north fringe areas which was later abandoned.  In addition, the new DART station at Clongriffin, which was supposed to open after 1,000 residents moved into the area, has not happened.  There are now 3,000 new residents living in new homes in the area yet there is no DART station and every promised deadline has been broken.  I have recently yet again inquired about that DART station and have been advised that it will not be available until September 2009 which is totally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, needs to update the Road Transport Act 1932 urgently as it is currently taking up to two and a half years to get a decision on a route licence from his Department which is totally unacceptable.  Updates to the 1932 legislation should have been included in the Bill but regrettably have not been.  There is a delay by the Department in granting permission to Dublin Bus to operate the 41X route from Swords to the city centre through the Dublin Port tunnel which is wrong.  I today ask the Minister to grant this licence to Dublin Bus which is trying to provide a good service to its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Fine Gael wants the Government to open the Dublin bus market to competition immediately.  We want to see integrated ticketing in place.  The cost of such a system has been €13 million to date, yet we have nothing to show for that.  We want to see new bus services and timetables devised to feed into metro and Luas, to include new housing estates and operate orbital routes, and provide non-stop services from the commuter belt.  We want to see the M50 work completed as soon as possible.  There seems to be no urgency at the moment.  It seems to be dragging on year after year.  Despite all the work there is no relief to the hard-pressed motorist on the M50.  That work should be made a priority.  The proposed €1 M50 toll increase is a complete rip-off and should not proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">I cannot support the Bill in its present form, as there would be a severe lack of accountability in the operation of the Dublin transport authority.  If this Bill is passed I am very fearful that we will end up with another super-quango like the HSE, which would be unaccountable to any Member of this House and might end up out of control.  I look forward to my comments being taken on board and the Bill being amended for the better.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_932">I welcome the Bill.  Transport 21 is an ambitious plan and is much needed.  The investment in transport in general and public transport in particular was a major project that began in the late 1990s for all surface transport across the country but was heavily focused in the greater Dublin area.  The progress already made both in Dublin and in other parts of the country has made a huge difference to quality of life but I accept there is a great deal to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I take the view that the Dublin transport authority will develop in time more like the National Roads Authority has done.  I am not sure of the relevance of the comparison with the Health Service Executive.  That is a completely different kettle of fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">My office has a role in regard to the management of St. Stephen's Green.  In some ways, this highlights the need for co-ordination because three major projects will impact on St. Stephen's Green, including the continuation of the Luas line to join up the red and green lines.  In all probability, that will go around part of the green.  The rail interconnector is planned for the same location and the metro north will start there to head out to the airport and beyond.  My predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, covered that point in his speech.  When talking about major engineering works being carried out by different agencies and authorities, one cannot emphasise enough the imperative for co-ordination and co-operation.  One of the roles of the Dublin transport authority will be to ensure that co-ordination happens in the vicinity of St. Stephen's Green and everywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">St. Stephen's Green is a focal point in Dublin and the work there will involve sensitive heritage and environmental considerations.  I am sure everybody will want to see the portion of the green that is affected fully restored after the works are carried out with minimal visual disruption.  Many people will want to ensure also that the ducks, swans and other bird life that might be disrupted in part of the water will be well looked after.  I and my office will do our best to ensure that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">There are often complaints while such projects are under way.  We have heard reference to that in the debate already about the disruption caused, when it will be over and whether it will all end in disaster.  The first such debate I can remember goes back 25 years.  The editor of the <i>Irish Press</i> used to write editorials about the total chaos that would ensue at the Merrion Gates when the DART system was built.  There are pressures along that road but it is not the sort of apocalypse that was predicted.  He was arguing for flyovers and possibly an eastern bypass as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">We have the same sort of situation at the Red Cow at the moment and around the M50.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle recalls when the Naas dual carriageway was being updated a year or two ago and travel on it was slow and inconvenient.  As one limped along, one wondered when it would ever end, but the fact is it did come right and it is now an excellent road.  When I was a columnist with <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> , the editorial staff were always giving out to me about the Luas construction along Harcourt Street.  <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> survived and the Luas provides a fine service into St. Stephen’s Green.  We have to accept when improvement is taking place that there will be some disruption.  However, it is important to have proper co-ordination in order to minimise the disruption but it is not totally avoidable.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The interconnector will have knock-on effects around the country.  A point was made in the <i> Irish Examiner</i> recently that according to timetables — not that timetables are always to be treated as gospel — mainline train speeds from places such as Cork, Limerick and Galway are slower than they were in the 1970s.  Part of the reason is the congestion on lines coming into and out of Dublin.  As I understand it, Irish Rail sees the interconnector as playing an important part in relieving that pressure.  Assuming that to be the case, it will have benefits throughout the mainline rail system.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The capital belongs to everyone and is used by many.  It is used by all of us at any rate during the middle of the week.  I lived in the city as a civil servant and adviser for 28 years.  I am now back in No. 52 St. Stephen's Green where I worked 30 years ago as a civil servant in the economic division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_942">I have met Deputy Olivia Mitchell more than once travelling in on the Luas.  I appreciate that I am only a recently appointed Minister of State, but there is a notion that Ministers are far removed from everyday reality and that we are driven around by other people.  As far as I was concerned yesterday, ministerial transport consisted of the DART and a people carrier the OPW has for its staff, which saves a lot of taxi fares.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">In the course of the day I also used the No. 11 and No. 59 buses.  I am immensely grateful.  I intend to continue to use public transport.  It is not only just one party in this House that uses public transport and bicycles at ministerial level.  I do not promise to use the bicycle much, although I have one at home in Tipperary, but I intend to go on using public transport to a considerable extent because it is an efficient method of transport.  One wastes less time because one can read easily on it, assuming that one is not catching a train where one has to stand in cramped conditions.  I appreciate that one of the bottlenecks is on the northern services.  I have seen that at stations.  People may be standing even before the train has left the first stop on the way from Pearse station to Dundalk.  I appreciate that much more needs to be done to try to sort out that bottleneck.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I am immensely grateful to those who drive me.  I have no ideological hang-ups about public service.  I like the notion of public service.  I am not, in general principle, in any way against unions but I appreciate that private enterprise can add something of value.  Something can appear very simple if one represents a constituency in south Dublin, regardless of party I hasten to add, but these are matters to be solved within the framework available to solve them, namely, social partnership negotiations.  There is a degree of flexibility in that regard.  I accept that more choice and competition is needed but that must be negotiated, it cannot simply be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">A major problem, both in the greater Dublin area and far removed from the greater Dublin area, is the issue of parking for public transport.  When I am in Dublin, if I want to get the Luas, which means that all I would have to do is cross St. Stephen's Green to my new office, I would have to reach the Stillorgan or Sandyford car parks by 8.30 a.m. at the latest because even though there are approximately 600 places, they will all be occupied by 8.30 a.m. or 8.45 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Many provincial railway stations, including Thurles and Limerick Junction, are increasingly difficult to park in unless one arrives for an early service.  There are suburban stations throughout Dublin to which every approach road is filled with cars parked on and off the pavement.  If we want more people to use public transport they must be able, in one shape or another, to park and ride, but in many places we are reaching the limits of our capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">One should not neglect the fact that transport links can play a major role in reviving somewhat neglected or run-down areas.  They can give a major boost in that regard.  The Luas has done that to a degree in areas like Smithfield and other areas in north Dublin.  The metro north will have an important role in connecting key areas, including hospitals and DCU.  I have some regret — Deputy O'Dowd might have a view on it — that it will merely go to Swords and Lissenhall and will not connect to the North-South railway line.  Even with the facilities now being provided by, among others, Aer Lingus in Aldergrove and so on, we totally underestimate the extent to which Dublin Airport in particular is used by people from the North.  That is something that may need to be further examined, but one can take these things in stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">There has been fierce vested interest opposition to the metro to the airport.  There is no doubt that large sums of money are collected by airport operators and those who might aspire to run terminals from parking fees.  We have seen how the chairman of Ryanair has regularly attempted to rubbish the metro north project, although one wonders how he would fare at his main hub in Stansted if there was not the rail link to London.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The metro is very expensive, I would almost say frighteningly expensive, and much of that expense has to do with land acquisition, not just the cost of building lines and operations.  That is the reason, for example, for the cost of a line, which is not much longer, from Cork to Midleton where the rights of way were preserved, although the cost is nothing like that of the metro, even on the overland stretch.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Integrated ticketing is long overdue.  It operates in most other cities.  One reason for the delay in its introduction is concern about guaranteeing revenue flows for the individual operators and that that will not get interrupted.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I noticed that everyone has steered clear so far in this debate — perhaps I have not heard all the contributions — of what one might call the campaign being run by the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the subject of a toll-free M50.  One should be clear that many of those campaigns may have merit.  I recall the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> did a “save the railway line to Derry” campaign but they are run, partly at least, to promote the sale of newspapers and not just the merits of the case.  There is a philosophical debate, in providing very good facilities like roads or railways, as to whether the users and beneficiaries should make some extra contribution or should it fall entirely to the general taxpayer?  I doubt the Minister intends to change the plans already in place on that and I cannot blame him for that.  He does not deserve the popular abuse he is getting from the <i>Evening Herald</i> but I hope it helps it to sell more newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Earlier this week, as I said in the context of another debate, I called in to the decentralised office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Tipperary town, which is the naturalisation service.  Talking to staff there they expressed the blessed relief of working close to home and not having to commute.  In any big city or metropolis people cannot in most cases live within easy walking distance of their place of work but we must try to make commuting as easy and comfortable as possible.  Above all, we must give people choice to ensure they have not only one way of going to work but that they can choose their times and methods of transport, which may vary from day to day.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_956">I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking on this legislation.  I never thought I would see the day that a Fianna Fáil Government would do something as practical and as logical as establish a single public body to take charge of transport in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">Fianna Fáil under late Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, when he came to power in 1987, abolished the original transport authority set up by the Labour-Fine Gael Government in the 1980s.  It has taken nearly a quarter of a century for Fianna Fáil to see the light again.  Even now the new Dublin transport authority will only be responsible for surface transport.  Inexplicably, the metro, which is run by the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, will not be included in the authority.  We therefore will have a Dublin transport authority for all surface transport in the greater Dublin area, but no authority for underground transport.  It appears to be an Irish solution to an Irish problem, as the former Taoiseach Charles Haughey, would have said.  I can imagine the problem we will probably continue to have as regards integrated ticketing.  I do not know how many deadlines we have had in this respect, but with two separate bodies now dealing with transport, it will be the next millennium before it is sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">No progress at all is being made.  Like the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, I travel by public transport when I go down the country.  I have been using Iarnród Éireann somewhat regularly over the recent weeks.  I purchase the ticket on-line, get a printout and reference number and turn up at either Connolly or Heuston, where, when one presents the piece of paper it is not recognised.  One has to use one's credit card in a particular machine, the purpose of which is to allocate a ticket.  However, one does not get a ticket by quoting the reference number or producing the computer printout.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Can one imagine any business person whose office gives him or her a ticket to travel somewhere in Ireland, which has been paid for by the company credit card?  Then he or she turns up at the station and is expected to produce a personal credit card in order to get the ticket.  All of this is a very cumbersome procedure because one can effectively get one's aeroplane ticket on-line — through the private sector — before going to the airport.  One has only to insert it into a machine when one is dealing with one's seating allocation or luggage before a flight.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">To make matters worse, none of the machines at Heuston station works.  If one is in a hurry and travelling to Galway or Cork, having ostensibly bought one's ticket on-line for the sake of speeding up the system, one must try to bludgeon one's way onto the train because the machine will not work — and the ticket collector will not accept one's reference number or piece of paper.  One must go back to the ticket office, queue up and get a ticket.  That is absolutely scandalous and outrageous, yet that is as far as we have got.  We are not even integrating the ticket system.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">It is a matter of having a coherent functioning ticket system that is not about queuing up at a counter in the fashion that has been going on for centuries.  That is a bad start indeed.  To return to the RPA issue, why has it been omitted?  The ostensible reason for this is indeed very hollow.  The Minister said in his speech today: "The absorption of the RPA by the authority could jeopardise the ongoing public private partnership procurement process in respect of metro north, which is at a critical and sensitive juncture.  Tender documents were issued to the four bidding consortia, just last week."   All of this is true, but after a quarter of a century of waiting, this sounds an astonishing reason for omitting one major agency of transport.  Even it were true — as I presume it is — why is there no provision in the Bill for incorporating the RPA into the authority at a later stage?  The only reason given is that we are at a critical stage of procurement for tenders at the present time.  When this is all over, in a year or two, why does the Minister not say he will introduce an amendment to include the RPA into the authority?  It does not make sense to wait all that time before we produce a greater Dublin transport authority, for which we have been waiting since the last one was abolished by the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey, when he came to power in 1987 — and now a decision has been made to omit a very important agency, the RPA, which is involved in all of the underground transport in this city.  It is not a very auspicious start for the authority in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I was delighted to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh say he would preserve the wildlife habitat that is St. Stephen's Green at the present time.  He will not allow it to be interfered with.  However, I note from the Minister's remarks that St. Stephen's Green is subject to preservation under the 1877 Act — and it cannot be used for any purpose, other than as a park.  Massive development work in terms of the metro and the interconnector are certainly going to interfere with that, so that is why there will be an amendment.  I understand that the park in Mountjoy Square is preserved under similar legislation.  I did not have time to check, but I should not be surprised if Parnell Square, which is going to have another major metro station, has similar underpinning legislation dating back to the 19th century — where the curtilage and park area of those squares were preserved specifically under the legislation for the purposes intended and could not be used in any other way.  Perhaps the Minister might check that out before the bulldozers are brought into Parnell Square.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">By the way, I am delighted Parnell Square will have a station pretty much in the heart of the city.  However, the next station for the metro north will be at the Mater.  I am one of those very much in favour of metro north despite Deputy Mansergh's remarks to the effect that there appear to be many vested interests opposing the line to the airport.  I was not aware that this was the case, although there was much concern by residents about the direction of part of the line, the depth of the tunnel and the necessary protective measures that needed to be put in place.  The Mater hospital is a very appropriate place for what will be a major station, but the RPA has decided there will be just one entrance — on the North Circular Road.  Of course, the entrance to the Mater hospital is on Eccles Street, and that will cause very considerable disadvantage in many ways.  My suggestion is that there should be a joint entrance there.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Park and ride facilities are key to all of this, an issue that to date has not been addressed.  I note that the metro north will not go into the airport <i>per se</i> but will stop about half a mile away, so that there will need to be a shuttle service right into the heart of the airport.  We are facing a crisis at present in and around Croke Park, where the local authority has draft by-laws out for consultation in terms of residents only parking on major event days.  These are becoming more frequent, of course, so eventually there will be a cordon around Croke Park, where nobody will be allowed to park.  It will be in the region of up to two miles in some areas.  At the same time we will not have any park and ride facilities.  This means the outer suburbs will be peppered with commuter traffic coming to various events in Croke Park, rather than the inner parts of the city, and this needs to be addressed in terms of the plans for the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I am delighted to see the establishment of the Dublin transport authority.  There should be just one authority and no exceptions.  We must run the city's transport system in a single-handed fashion.  Failure to do so has caused the major problems that have arisen to date.  I hope the Minister will take on board an amendment to subsume the Railway Procurement Agency into the authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an mBille tábhachtach seo.  Táimid ag feitheamh leis an mBille leis na blianta.  Is trua é go bhfuil a leithéid de Bhille, a bhunaíonn údarás den tsórt seo, ós ár gcomhair.  Léiríonn sé nach bhfuil an Rialtas seo, nó aon Rialtas eile, in ann déileáil le fadhbanna tráchta Bhaile Átha Cliath agus a dtimpeallacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoi roinnt mionphointí a d'ardaigh mé cúpla uair ar Bhillí eile.  Measaim gur chóir i gcónaí go mbeadh "údarás iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath", seachas "Dublin transport authority", in úsáid.  Sa chaoi sin, is ina mhalairt de shlí a bheadh sé ós ár gcomhair.  Ba chóir den Bhille "a body to be known as údarás iompair Bhaile Átha Cliath, or in the English language as the Dublin transport authority" a leagan amach.  Tá athrú déanta ar an chleachtadh le roinnt blianta anuas.  Faoi láthair, tugtar teideal Béarla sa chéad áit ar aon eagras nua a bhunaíonn an Stát.  Is ansin a luaitear an tainm Gaeilge.  Is a mhalairt de chleachtadh a bhí ann nuair a bhunaíodh an Stát.  Ní gá dúinn ach féachaint ar roinnt de na heagrais agus comhalachtaí Stáit cáiliúla — Córas Iompair Éireann, Bus Éireann agus Bus Átha Cliath ina measc — chun é sin a thuiscint.  Is trua é go bhfuil dearmad déanta ar an chleachtadh sin sa chás seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Má tá an reachtaíocht seo chun déiléala leis an dtodhchaí, tá sé suimiúil go bhfuil an túdarás seo srianta i gceantracha áirithe, atá leagtha amach sa Bhille.  Baineann sé le Átha Cliath Theas, Fine Gall, Dún Laoghaire-Ráth an Dúin, Baile Átha Cliath, Cill Dara, Cill Mhantáin agus an Mhí.  Ba chóir go mbeadh a leithéid d'údarás ag dul beagáinín níos faide ná sin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh gar do 50 míle i gceist, chun go mbeadh an chuid is gnóthaí de Chontae Lú san áireamh.  Má smaoinímid ar an líon daoine a thaistilíonn go dtí Baile Átha Cliath as cheantair ar nós Droichead Átha — nó Dún Dealgan, fiú — gach lá, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil ceangal mór acu leis na fadhbanna tráchta atá sa chathair seo.  Ba chóir dúinn pleananna a fhorbairt chun an daonra sin a thabhairt san áireamh.  Tá níos mó ná 1.5 milliún duine clúdaithe sa mhéid atá luaite sa reachtaíocht.  Caithfimid cinneadh a dhéanamh conas is féidir linn déileáil le trácht sa cheantar sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Ba cheart dúinn a chinntiú go mbeidh an túdarás seo freagrach don Dáil.  Ní chóir go mbeadh aon bhealach ina mbeidh an túdarás in ann freagracht a sheachaint.  Nuair a chuirfimid ceisteanna ar an tAire Iompair, caithfidh go mbeidh sé nó sí in ann freagraí a thabhairt dúinn.  Go minic, ní bhíonn freagraí le fáil.  Ní gá dúinn ach féachaint ar an HSE chun é sin a fheiscint.  Cuirtear moill ar na freagraí gur chóir dúinn a fháil sa Teach seo.  Ní bhíonn na freagraí ar thaifead na Dála.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Labhróidh mé mar gheall ar roinnt rudaí eile atá laistigh den Bhille.  Measaim go bhfuil sé dainsearach go dealraíonn sé go gcuideoidh an Bille seo le tabhairt isteach príobháidiú sna chórais iompair, ar a laghad ar na bealaí busanna agus amach anseo ar an iarnród atá á fhorbairt i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Níl ach cúig bliana de chonradh i gceist, i dtús báire, ó thaobh Bus Átha Cliath nó Bus Éireann de.  Leanfaidh an conradh iarnróid ar feadh deich mbliana.  Measaim gur chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó de chonradh tugtha dóibh.  Ba chóir go ndéanfaimid cinnte de go dtugfaí tús áite don chóras phoiblí atá á hoibriú ag an Stát, seachas an bealach atá leagtha amach sa Bhille seo a leanúint.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Decades of underfunding of public transport by successive Governments have resulted in absolute traffic chaos every day in this city and its outskirts.  Congestion has made it very difficult for people to commute and for those living in the city to go about their daily business.  The city has been shaped by the unco-ordinated interests of property developers, friends of Fianna Fáil.  One developer, McNamara Construction, which is run by a former Fianna Fáil councillor, seems to be in trouble at present.  It is regrettable that decisions on our transport system have been taken on the basis of the interests of speculators.  Speculators and greedy developers, rather than city councillors, have planned our city for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">Despite Government claims to the contrary, the emphasis remains on facilitating the private car as a means of transport rather than on seeking to address the real problems causing congestion.  If we are serious about this issue, we need to double or treble the public fleet of buses in Dublin.  By doing so, we would have an efficient transport network and commuters would be able to trust bus timetables.  There has been progress but because of the concentration on the private car, it is sometimes a question of one step forward and two steps back.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Our inadequate transport infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the unprecedented explosion in car ownership and use.  Successive incompetent Governments have ensured that the car is no longer a luxury but a necessity because the roads are choked.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The term "greater Dublin area" suggests a land-grab by Dubliners.  We are now taking over Meath and Wicklow and other counties.  Perhaps we will win an all-Ireland final in Gaelic games if we entice some of the people in the areas to which we are moving to play for us.  The people of the greater Dublin area deserve adequately funded, integrated public transport that is quick, affordable, reliable, clean and safe.  I hope this Bill will address this issue and that is why I welcome it, but it could have gone a lot further.  By comparison with the transport systems in other European cities, the system in Dublin is pathetic.  Much more needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Dublin Bus requires many more buses.  The subsidy given to Dublin Bus is very low by European standards and it needs to be increased substantially so there will be a viable alternative to the private car.  At present, only 50% of Dublin Bus's fleet is accessible to those with impaired mobility.  This figure needs to increase urgently so all those with a disability can access public transport on their doorstep.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">We must examine other European cities with a view to providing more cycle lanes and safer routes for cyclists throughout the city.  Proper enforcement is required to ensure cyclists are not put in danger at road works and by drivers who have no regard for them.  Not enough will be done by the Dublin transport authority to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Hopefully, Members will be able to tackle some of the faults and problems associated with this legislation on Committee Stage.  At the end of this process, it is to be hoped that a proper údarás will have been set up that can address the chaos that takes place in the streets of Dublin on a daily basis.  Moreover, public private partnerships to deliver public transport should not be used.  This week, Members already have witnessed the chaos that public private partnerships can deliver to communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_981">I welcome this necessary Bill.  While my constituency has some fantastic public transport and some fantastic privately-operated public transport, it does not work together.  At present, the licensing system is extremely <i>ad hoc</i> and does not provide an integrated transport system in any shape or form.  For instance, buses are obliged to start at particular locations simply to be at some remove from a Bus Éireann service.  The inability to provide bus stops is making life difficult for large numbers of people who wish to use particular services.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">I welcome the inclusion of County Meath within this authority's area of responsibility.  County Meath has the rail line from Drogheda, much of which lies within County Meath and is in my constituency.  Moreover, the rail line from Navan and Dunboyne is well on the way.  While bus services exist, as noted earlier they are not integrated, no system of bus stops is in place and ticketing is not integrated.  Some of the private companies that operate in my constituency are forward-thinking in respect of integrated ticketing and want it to work.  While they have been working with the Department, it will not happen in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Nevertheless, it constitutes a highly important part of this Bill.  For instance, although I can get a bus from where I live to Laytown train station, it is not possible to buy a ticket to Dublin.  One first must buy a ticket to Laytown and subsequently purchase a ticket from Laytown to Dublin.  However, I use the train on a regular basis, including today.  In general, a good service is provided by both train and bus service operators and I am happy to use them.  It is a great way to meet my constituents, a large percentage of whom use public transport.  In the east Meath towns of Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington and Stamullen, as many as 75% of those who live there commute to work in Dublin on a daily basis.  This is a massive figure and issues pertaining to public transport are extremely important in my constituency and always have been extremely important to me.  I used the services for years when I worked in Dublin.  However, as a Deputy for the constituency, it is important that I continue to use them to see at first hand both the benefits of the services and the difficulties caused to people when the services do not work as well as they might or when service provision has been insufficient for the existing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">An issue that Iarnród Éireann continually tells me it cannot deal with or can only be dealt with over a long time concerns the price of tickets and the fares scheme.  Opposition Members have mentioned it is a great deal more expensive to travel to Dublin from Drogheda, Laytown or Gormanston than it is from Balbriggan and other stations that are closer to the city centre.  It is an expensive business.  According to the train ticket I used today, it costs €16.40 for a return ticket from Drogheda to Dublin.  Were one to travel from Balbriggan to Dublin, the price would be approximately €6 or €7, or possibly less.  This is a particular bugbear of mine that I have impressed on Ministers and on Iarnród Éireann.  I will continue to so do because I am unhappy with some of the answers I have received on the issue, particularly from Iarnród Éireann.  Its argument is that there is a better service from Drogheda, namely, the Enterprise express service.  While that is true in respect of Drogheda, as the service does not operate in either Laytown or Gormanston, this argument does not stand up.  As in other countries, there might be an argument to charge a higher price for the Enterprise service, were prices to be reduced substantially on the other services.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">This issue must be dealt with and can be dealt with under this Bill.  The authority can develop a fare scheme for public transport in the greater Dublin area.  This would include services to Drogheda, which can be made part of the greater Dublin area for those services.  The town itself could be incorporated into the area, if the Minister so decided.  The services certainly will be part of it and will be under the authority's control as it would be completely illogical otherwise.  This matter must be dealt with because it affects people's daily lives and adds a huge cost to them.  If one performs the mathematics, it probably is cheaper to drive to Dublin if one can and if one has access to parking facilities, than it is to take the train from stations in my constituency such as Drogheda, Laytown or Gormanston.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">While people consider Gormanston to be a very small place, it is the main train station for what is now the large town of Stamullen.  A particular bugbear in Stamullen is that although a fantastic new car parking facility was provided in Gormanston, Iarnród Éireann decided to charge for it.  I have no difficulty with this as the charge is quite reasonable.  However, the cost of a ticket to travel from Gormanston to Dublin is much higher than an equivalent ticket to travel from Balbriggan, which is only two or three miles away.  Consequently, there could be a difference of €10 on a day return ticket.  I do not have the figures to hand for monthly or weekly tickets.  However, this constitutes a real disincentive to use the services and the fantastic new car park in Gormanston.  I noted this morning, as I passed by Gormanston on the train, that its car park was half empty.  A large number of my constituents from Stamullen take the train from Balbriggan and I saw many of them getting on the train there.  If the authority has such a power, it should use it for the benefit of people and for a more logical fare structure.  This step is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I refer to the issue of bus stops and access to railway stations in east Meath.  For the last two years, a private company has been providing a service that was not provided previously by Bus Éireann.  It is a fantastic service, which runs every hour on the hour into Dublin from where I live and all around Donacarney, Bettystown, Laytown and Julianstown.  However, no bus stops exist and I receive regular calls to both my constituency and Dáil offices about buses stopping outside people's houses.  While the buses are licensed and are entitled to stop, the lack of infrastructure for them to pull in or to allow bus stops to be erected with information pertaining to timetables etc. constitutes a disadvantage and causes problems.  I look forward to the authority taking action in this regard when this Bill is passed by this House.  As it already has been passed by the Seanad, hopefully it will be passed rapidly by this House.  Thereafter, the authority can get going and the Dublin Transportation Office can be merged into the authority, as is provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">I wish to raise an issue in respect of planning and development because east Meath often is held up as a bad example.  However, it is not as bad as the media and Members opposite would have one believe.  A great community exists in east Meath.  There are difficulties that we wish to overcome, including those I mentioned relating to schools.  A provision in section 86 of the Bill states that each planning authority within the greater Dublin area, GDA, including Meath County Council in my constituency, shall ensure that its local area plans are consistent with the transport strategy of the Dublin transport authority, DTA.  If the Minister were so minded, I would be keen to see this provision strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">A local area plan that is not consistent with the transport strategy of the DTA should not exist because the consequences of not complying with transport strategies that are for the good of the public may last a long time and may cost the Government and local authorities a great deal to rectify later.  This is a great and welcome provision but I hope it is sufficiently strong.  Local authorities, councillors and colleagues enact local area plans and development plans.  Why are development plans not mentioned here?  Perhaps they are mentioned in another section.  I presume this matter is covered.  When local area plans are enacted they should take account of transport issues, rather than go for the easy option.  If public transport is not available in a particular place, councillors should think very carefully about zoning land for various purposes.  Local area plans should include incentives.  For example, a council could decide to zone land for residential purposes subject to land being set aside for the DTA for a train station, bus interchange etc.  There are imaginative proposals councillors can make to ensure that they are consistent with transport strategy and that they play their parts in maximising the potential of an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">Integrated ticketing is a big issue, and the public wants, expects and looks forward to that.  It would be fantastic if one could buy a single ticket to take the bus from Grangerath, where I live, to Dublin, then take a train and perhaps get the Luas to Dundrum or Sandyford.  That is necessary and should be one of the first priorities of the DTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">There are some interesting provisions in the legislation relating to authorities implementing traffic management plans.  Under the legislation, authorities in the GDA are required to prepare and adopt a strategic management plan for traffic every six years.  The aim is to ensure the best movement of persons, goods, services and vehicles.  This is good and in the Bill the DTA is given certain powers relating to local authorities.  It may direct local authorities and road authorities to acquire land, prepare designs for specified works, undertake specified works, undertake traffic management schemes and apply the proceeds of parking or traffic management revenues for specified traffic management or transport related purposes.  This is a good thing because often local authorities apply parking charges, which is good, but the money goes into the general fund.  The Bill aims to see such funds used for public transport or traffic management purposes.  Perhaps we will approach the DTA to issue directions if we want road authorities to deal with traffic.  Sometimes it is difficult to get local authorities and road authorities to do things that we see as logical, cost-effective and inexpensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">I have a copy of the Bill as passed in the Seanad on Committee Stage but I understand the Seanad has since removed the provision barring councillors and members of local authorities from being members of the Dublin transport authority.  This is a welcome step and I am sure Senators will be delighted and will let their electorate know of this development.  Local councillors and public representatives generally are at the coalface regarding public transport and the zoning of land so their involvement is welcome.  I hope that when appointments are made to the authority, councillors are considered, especially those who displayed a particular interest in these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">The councils involved include Dublin City Council and those for Fingal, Dún Laghaoire-Rathdown, South County Dublin, Meath and Wicklow so a large area is covered.  The DTA will have overall responsibility for all surface transport and will have a hugely significant role.  There will be a shake-up when this body comes into being.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">I have been involved with a few other Deputies on this issue, including a number from my party.  The Dublin Transportation Office has conducted high level studies relating to a 20-year period and I understand from the legislation that the Dublin transport authority will have to create a strategic transport plan covering a 12-year to 20-year period, which is to be welcomed.  The DTO has consulted TDs on this and trying to see how the city and region will develop over that period is very interesting.  It is a difficult task because in my constituency land was zoned when it might have been better if it had not been.  Nobody expected the amount of building that has happened and it would have been difficult to plan for.  Some of the problems we have were preventable but nobody could have foreseen the huge growth that has taken place.  Putting in place a transport plan that covers such a long period is a difficult task for the authority but it is necessary; we must not look back and regret planning for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The authority will allocate capital and current funding for public transport and traffic management.  It is good that this is being done in a holistic way that deals with all the facets of public transport in the Dublin region.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I pay tribute to the providers of public and private transport in my constituency.  Bus Éireann and its staff provide a fantastic service and its staff are always helpful.  Irish Rail provides a good service within the infrastructural constraints it faces and its staff are very helpful.  The infrastructure has improved significantly over the years.  Private operators in my area also provide a very good service and people are happy to use them.  Flexibus, part of the Meath accessible transport project, provides a fantastic service in areas which other operators cannot go into.  It operates services from small villages such as Stamullen, Bellewstown, Rathfeigh and Ardcath.  It also operates services to the hospital and various clinics.  At my request Flexibus began a service between the village of Stamullen and Gormanstown train station, which is reasonably well used, though it could be better used.  This is something constituents requested during the election campaign and I was delighted that Flexibus went ahead with the service because it showed a knowledge of the newer areas of my constituency.  Deputy Michael Kennedy referred to the Nipper services between housing estates and train stations and they are important.  Flexibus has provided such a service in one part of my constituency and hopefully the authority will develop this idea when the legislation is enacted.  We want superior transport and more of it to make the area better.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_629">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_997">The tone of my remarks will be slightly different from that of the last speaker.  I think Dublin's transport policy has suffered badly in the past 15 years.  John Wilson's decision to abolish the Dublin transport authority was terrible.  We are now re-establishing the authority after many years and many lost opportunities.  Dublin's transport strategy has not had coherent leadership during this period — about four Ministers are involved with dozens of semi-State companies, all of which are monopolies, and four or five councils have their oar in.  There has not been coherent leadership in this area.  We have come up with ideas that were blindingly obvious, such as integrated ticketing.  On the third attempt, as the Minister of State will have heard during his time on the Committee of Public Accounts, integrated ticketing was a disaster.  We buried about €7 million or €8 million as the system was abandoned.  Why did that happen?  It was because wholly owned State companies deliberately obstructed the development of what was supposed to be public policy and there was no one to drive it through.  There was no leadership within Government to deliver public policy.  The Committee of Public Accounts rightly gave a withering report on the performance of the State in this area.  We have also had withering reports from the committee on the way in which major public infrastructure projects were managed in the city, including the huge over-runs on Luas and the port tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The challenges faced by Dublin city over the last decade include a 42% increase in the number of passenger journeys over the last decade from Dublin county alone, not to mention Louth, Kildare and Wicklow.  If we look beyond the boundaries the number is probably doubled.  Why the Government decided to freeze the number of buses in the public bus network for five of those years defies understanding.  Why it did not carry out its commitment to introduce bus competition, so that the private sector could offer alternatives and develop new opportunities, again defies understanding.  These are public policies that were enunciated not by this Minister or previous Ministers but by Deputy O'Rourke in her capacity as Minister for Public Enterprise.  She introduced these policies eight to ten years ago but they have not yet been carried out.  Someone within the great army opposite must take some responsibility for this.  I take my hat off to the Minister of State, who is willing to stand up, take responsibility and criticise people who are failing.  This is a chronic failure, the consequences of which are very serious and will stay with us for decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The core Government strategy over the last decade was to achieve modal shift — to get people to leave their cars at home and switch to public transport, but a decade on the census shows there has been zero modal shift whatsoever.  Whatever gains were made by Luas and DART were lost in the bus service.  We have made no headway.  Indeed, it is far worse than that.  If we consider other modes such as cycling, which the present Minister, who is not here at the moment, has stated is a core aspect of his strategy, we find that the absolute number of people cycling has dropped by 20% in the last decade, despite a declared public policy of promoting cycling.  I understand why people are not cycling — to ride a bicycle in the city would be taking one's life in one's hands much of the time.  The number of schoolchildren cycling has dropped particularly precipitously, although one would imagine they would make a perfect target group for a public policy promoting cycling.  The share of people who cycle has dropped by 50% over that period, with less than 4% of people using bicycles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Another issue that has been clearly enunciated in public policy is the promotion of shared car journeys, so that cars are encouraged not to come into the city with only one driver.  Again, over the last decade, the number of shared car journeys — those with more than one person per car — has halved.  The outcome is entirely the opposite to the stated aim of public policy.  Many extra journeys have been generated in the growth areas to the north and west of the city.  Of these, 90% are undertaken by car, while public transport caters for only 10%.  This represents a chronic failure in planning and delivery.  Buses are a flexible tool that could have been used to serve those areas, but I know some of them myself and they have not been sufficiently targeted.  We do not have any level of accountability for the way in which the resources we commit to Dublin Bus are deployed in terms of routes and frequencies.  The poor results in the bus sector have been obtained at huge cost.  As the Minister of State knows, the cost of the subvention to Dublin Bus has increased more than tenfold over the last decade, increasing from €5 million to €80 million.  The amount of the fare attributed to subvention, which was the equivalent of 12 cent in 1999, is now 54 cent.  Thus, we are investing more public money while persuading fewer passengers to use the system.  It is costing us more.  In the core growth areas, where we should be delivering services so that those living in these high-growth areas do not become car-dependent, more and more people are using cars as their sole source of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">This has been a decade of chronic failure in planning, execution and delivery of transport in Dublin.  While I will give one cheer for the arrival of the Dublin Transport Authority, it does not deserve any more than that.  I hope it will bring some coherence, but I suspect that many of the problems that have beset previous Ministers for Transport will also beset the authority.  The fundamental obstacles that have prevented effective development of transport strategy have not been removed simply by moving responsibility from a Minister to this authority.  That is the point I make to the Minister of State, who is standing in for the Minister on this issue.  We need assurance that we are genuinely seeing change and that this is not a continuation of the tendency, for which we were criticised by the OECD, for Ministers, when they are tackling a thorny problem and find it is not being dealt with effectively, to set up an agency that removes responsibility from the Minister's desk, with all the attendant problems such as lack of accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">I am concerned that all the problems that have bedevilled Dublin transport in the last decade will continue to do so under this agency.  There is no public accountability in this new agency.  The issue of consumer powerlessness, which is the heart of the reason we do not have an effective system, is untouched.  There is still no commitment to introduce competition so that we may have alternatives and contestability of the monopoly providers in this sector.  The citizens of Dublin will not ride shotgun in this agency.  They have been almost entirely squeezed out.  Having a token councillor or official on the authority is not democratic accountability.  Members of the House will also be cut out.  There will be no more Dáil questions about performance in this area — not that the questions produce much useful information already.  "Regulatory capture" is a phrase used by economists to describe a situation in which those being regulated have taken over the regulator.  That is a real danger with this new authority, as it has been in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">Going through the Bill, one searches in vain for any measure designed to empower users of public services.  This is a core issue.  The recent OECD report stated that the problem with our public service is that it is not consumer-centred or customer-friendly.  It is not out there trying to assess customers' needs and meeting them.  Nowhere in the Bill is there a new mandate under which public transport providers will have to become customer-sensitive agencies.  There is not even a commitment to route and frequency review.  We know Dublin Bus has not matched the changing population patterns in the city.  It has been content with what it is doing and it has not responded to consumers.  This must change.  In the section that refers to contracts, tucked away at the end as a sort of also-ran, it is stated that the contracts may include, where the authority considers it appropriate, issues of consumer satisfaction and performance.  There is not even an obligation on the authority, when it enters into contracts, to monitor these issues.  It is just an afterthought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">The existing State companies have been given exclusive rights to continue operating the routes they already have.  If exclusivity has been guaranteed, where is the change?  The public operators are being put in the driving seat in terms of setting public service obligations.  This is the notion that some routes are loss-making.  There should be a tendering process for loss-making routes and if there is no tendering process, there should be full transparency.  The authority must set the appropriate subvention and if the company does not deliver, it should look elsewhere.  However, the situation is the reverse.  The public company is being asked how much it would cost to deliver a service and is then being written a cheque.  This is not a change, rather it is the persistence of what has always been the case.  The subvention increased from €16 million in 1999 to €80 million currently because the question of whether the €80 million so-called public service obligation is delivering real public service to a travelling public in need has not been asked.  There has been no scrutiny and there will be none under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">No provision has been made for publishing route by route the cost of the public service obligation.  The Government is persisting in the belief that a monopoly's bus route performance should remain a secret.  Why should this be the case?  We are paying for the service and we have a right to know how many passengers are travelling, whether the buses are travelling on time, whether the routes are losing money and how much of the taxpayers' money goes to subvent the buses.  Why should we be denied this information?  There is no mention of opening the system up to public scrutiny even within the monopolistic structure to which the Government is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Accountability is a core issue for Fine Gael.  The authority will be run by an executive and five ministerial appointees and will have an advisory council.  The Bill does not establish a forum for public scrutiny.  There will be no monitoring and scrutineering on behalf of the ordinary travelling public of the standards of service provided by the companies awarded contracts.  An internal club of people examining one another is a recipe for regulatory capture, as has been the experience time and again among regulators.  The scrutiny must be public and the advisory council must conduct its work in public, but the latter is not provided for.  This is public rather than private business, the spending of taxpayers' money to provide public transport.  Why should it not be out in the open, which would allow us to question whether something is value for money?</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">We will be kept in the dark concerning many performance standards.  The authority will not rail against poor performance or set and publish standards.  The Bill does not provide for the publication of the contractors' standards of performance.  The contracts will be private, but the fact that there will be no publication must be changed.  The fact that there is no requirement to reveal what has been paid must also change.  Accountability to the Dáil is crucial, as there must be some accountability in the new structure.  The Dáil would not be the only suitable forum.  In 2002 when we believed that a Dublin transport authority was imminent, the Joint Committee on Transport, of which I was a member at the time, recommended a body comprised exclusively of Dublin politicians to scrutinise the performance of the authority and the agencies delivering public transport services.  The body would eventually become directly elected.  Why should there be no direct democratic accountability, which is at the core of the issue?  There will be none, nor will there be Dáil questions, rather there will be occasional appearances before committees, as is the unsatisfactory case in respect of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">The Bill runs the risk of creating another HSE.  We are not considering whether the establishment of a centralised body will lead to many savings among the bodies that have been regulating and managing public transport to date.  The OECD outlined a key issue in lights, that is, if one is restructuring operations and establishing a new agency, as occurred in respect of the HSE, one must determine whether savings will be made, whether services will be delivered more effectively, how management structures will be rationalised and redundant bodies will be removed.  None of these matters is addressed in the Bill.  Rather, it accepts that everything will continue unchanged.  A new body is being foisted on top of current bodies.  Local authorities and monopolising companies will retain their roles and that is being copper-fastened, which is not the radical reform required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">I will make myself unpopular, but price is the most effective tool in demand and traffic management.  Deciding not to consider congestion charging for many years is crazy.  We are continually introducing physical rationing mechanisms.  For example, we install lanes, ramps and one-way systems and prevent people travelling on them.  Despite imposing regulatory obligations that incur costs and affect people, we will not consider pricing as a means through which to allow people to make choices on how to spend their money.  I had believed that we were in the market system and that we recognised price as an efficient tool to help people to allocate resources more effectively.  It ensures that expensive public infrastructure is used effectively.  However, it has been decided that price will not play a part in this matter.  While road pricing may not be popular, it is an important element in any public transport strategy.  The Government is deciding that pricing will not form part of the current strategy and that we must wait for God knows what to befall us for it to be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">Pricing cannot be applied everywhere, but it can form part of a strategy that matches investment in infrastructure with pricing mechanisms to try to increase the efficient usage of the infrastructure.  It would be a legitimate and logical way to proceed.  The ESRI's medium-term review stated that installing infrastructure is easy whereas managing it effectively to deliver the intended results is difficult.  Policies must underpin the management, but the Government is fascinated by installing infrastructure.  Ministers claim that the national development plan is a God send and that we should spend, spend, spend.  Deputy O'Connor knows that roads will be full a day after they have been built.  People will buy more cars and fill the space.  Pricing plays a role in using infrastructure intelligently and allocating it efficiently.</p>

          <p eId="para_1014">I do not oppose the establishment of the Dublin transport authority as it will be important.  However, we must change many of the underlying failures that prevented an effective transport strategy during the past decade.  It is not that Ministers did not want such a strategy, rather they could not make it occur because many of the strong agencies in question obstructed policy.  If we are to change the situation, we must do more than simply establish a new agency.  We must have genuine consumer choice and public accountability and we must hunt down the wasteful use of public money, such as in terms of buses.  This must be the new standard applied by the DTA.  However, the Bill is more of the same — guaranteeing the rights of this or that body to remain exclusive, keeping the Dáil and councils out of the picture and setting up small committees to run the authority.  The Minister would have been more effective than those committees had he only done his job, but he was unable to do so.  Why did he not do his job during the past decade?  Will the Government guarantee that the situation will be different after the establishment of this quango and will the former make targets that will stick?</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">I am particularly sensitive that I will be followed by another big hitter in Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">I see more to welcome in this Bill than Deputy Bruton does.  It offers great prospects for the future of Dublin's transport system.  I often mention Tallaght in my contributions and, on this occasion, I speak as a proud Dubliner.  Members from the west are probably fascinated to hear so much about Dublin, although I am sure Senator Butler's guests from Foxrock, who are in the Gallery, will understand my accent better than those of some other speakers.  People often think I was born in Tallaght but that is not the case.  I was born locally in Holles Street, went to school on Clarendon Street and lived on Stephen Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">That is a bygone era.  Some Members will be surprised I am so old but I recall looking out from my grandmother's house on the corner of Stephen Street and South Great George's Street and seeing tram tracks being pulled up.  I make this point not to be negative but to emphasise that caution is required in the provision of all our infrastructure, particularly transport infrastructure.  What was done in my childhood days has come back to haunt the city, if not the nation.  It is important we put in place infrastructure that will last and which meets people's needs.  I recognise that Ireland consists of more than Dublin but the city and its environs comprise a large population centre.  It is vital we provide adequate infrastructure in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The requirement for a Dublin transport authority was originally outlined as part of the launch of Transport 21 in November 2005.  A small team, chaired by Professor Margaret O'Mahony of Trinity College, was established to make recommendations on the functions, structure and organisation of the proposed authority.  This body reported in March 2006 and the Government approved the drafting of legislation in July 2006.  In accordance with the commitment in Towards 2016, the report was published and submissions were invited from interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The programme for Government agreed in June 2007 committed the new Government, comprising Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and some Independents, to expediting the establishment of the Dublin transport authority.  Following his appointment, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, initiated a review of the draft legislation, which was completed earlier this year.  This review resulted in improvements to the Bill in several areas, particularly in regard to the interaction between land use and transport planning, public transport service provision and accountability of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The authority's functional area will comprise the greater Dublin area, incorporating the geographical remits of Dublin City Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, as well as Kildare, Meath and Wicklow county councils.  The authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the greater Dublin area.  The Bill puts in place the structures necessary to rationalise and streamline the planning and implementation of transport infrastructure and services in the region.  The authority will have a clear mandate to transform the transport system in the capital and will have unambiguous statutory authority to implement its mandate.  Fundamental to that will be the development of an integrated transport system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I do not claim that transport infrastructure and services in Dublin are perfect.  I live in Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the State.  The Acting Chairman will allow me to speak about Tallaght because other colleagues have referred to every street in Drogheda and elsewhere.  I am sure many streets in Kildare will be mentioned in due course.  I have a particular understanding of this issue, going back to my time as a county councillor.  I notice the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has entered the Chamber.  He was a far more famous county councillor than I in those days but we soldiered together.  I did not wait until last year to admit that we often found common ground and generally worked well together.  Following the break-up of Dublin Corporation in 1994, I was elected to South Dublin County Council where transport infrastructure soon emerged as an important political issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I am proud of what has been achieved in the area of transport.  However, I acknowledge — to coin a phrase — that there is a lot done and a lot more to do.  I heard the fine contribution earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  As a person from the inner city, I was glad to hear the commitment he gave to safeguard the ducks in St. Stephen's Green, which is an important issue for me and my granddaughter.  He also made the point that he will continue to make use of public transport.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, also uses public transport, as well as riding his bicycle.  I have not ridden a bicycle for a long time but I am always happy to use public transport, whenever that is possible.  I would have preferred not to drive into the city today but I had to bring my car because I am collecting a large quantity of material on the Lisbon treaty.  I could not bring that home on the Luas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">The same is true of the DART.  We must emphasise the importance of using public transport as much as possible.  I will continue to do so.  Taking the Luas from Tallaght and walking to Kildare Street is a much quicker journey than driving from Tallaght to Leinster House.  It also keeps me fit and well.  I am glad that my health is benefiting as a result of using public transport and walking.</p>

          <p eId="para_1032">I strongly support the further extension of the Luas system.  I have been campaigning for it for some time.  I always took the view that the Luas line should have started at the Point Depot rather than Connolly Station and should have continued on through the west Tallaght estates to serve the communities in Saggart and Citywest.  I am glad that a commitment has been given in this regard.  I was also critical at the time the Luas was launched that the two lines were not joined.  I understand there are engineering difficulties in this regard but I remain of the view that it should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Now that we have seen how successful the initiative has been, there is no doubt that we must continue to develop it.  We all know the old saying that to make an omelette, one must break eggs.  However, I have heard colleagues make the point that this development will necessitate much disruption in terms of digging up streets and so on.  Dubliners and people who visit the city from the west and elsewhere are tolerant of the necessity for some disruption in order to make progress.  With the further development of the Luas system and the introduction of the metro, people will understand the challenges that arise.  We will all have days when we complain but I expect we will generally be tolerant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">I was not being flippant when I spoke about the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and the ducks in St. Stephen's Green.  The Government and the new authority will have to be sensitive to the effects of development on the local environment, not only in the inner city but also in my area and in the areas which will be served by metro north.  Those decisions must be taken in a sensitive way to ensure disruption is kept to a minimum and that heed is taken of preservation requirements.  Many of my constituents have expressed concerns to me about how the development will affect Tallaght village, the current infrastructure on the Belgard Road and the site of the institute of technology.  Those questions will have to be addressed.  I will always be prepared to represent those with such concerns, as will my colleagues.  That is very important.  When all this infrastructure has been provided, people will be happy.  I occasionally visit the airport, although I do not go as often as some.  I wish I could have gone to Moscow tonight but we are too busy.  I do not want say a lot about the M50 and the problems it is currently encountering.</p>

          <p eId="para_1045">It is good to get out of our cars and take public transport or go walking, not only in terms of our well being but also for the environment.  I hope Members opposite will support me in making that plea.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">Other colleagues have discussed Dublin Bus.  Years ago, when I attended secondary school in Drimnagh Castle and before I knew where Tallaght was, my mother told me not to travel too far up the road or I would get lost.  I was living in Crumlin at the time.  A friend of mine who lived in Tallaght told me that if he did not leave school in time to get the 4.15 p.m. bus from the Long Mile House, he would not get home until 7 p.m.  Some critics would argue nothing has changed.  The Luas is in place and there have been a number of developments in respect of bus services in Tallaght and the Dublin region.  Reference was made on the ministerial benches to the need for joined up thinking.  Sometimes I wonder whether those who have responsibility for public transport consider planning from the perspective of new communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">As part of last week's visit by the Ceann Comhairle's Oireachtas education initiative to Dublin South-West, my good friend, Deputy Rabbitte, and I met students in St. MacDara's Community College.  We were asked a number of practical questions by young people from the Firhouse and Ballycullen areas.  The students pointed out that the bus service for these areas, which have developed in recent years, is still in the dark ages.  These are the issues which people want addressed.  The Minister of State at the Department of Food and Agriculture spoke about new communities in north Dublin and Deputy Thomas Byrne discussed County Meath.  I do not understand why transport providers do not consider how they will serve people from those communities or persuade them to leave their cars behind.  South Dublin County Council has won a number of awards for its proposals for Adamstown and Lucan, which require that stand alone communities have all the infrastructure and facilities they require.  That is the way it should be everywhere.  I do not wish to be parochial because everyone can speak about their own areas but I concur with the young people from Ballycullen and Firhouse when they say they cannot understand Dublin Bus's inability to provide a decent service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Having kicked Dublin Bus, I also want to praise the company.  On Monday, I attended a function in Fettercairn in west Tallaght with Deputies Brian Hayes, Conor Lenihan and Rabbitte, at which awards were presented to several local schools, including St. Anne's in Fettercairn, St. Aidan's in Brookfield, St. Agnes's in Crumlin, which is out of my constituency but beside my former home, and St. Paul's in Greenhills.  Young people were given awards for protecting their bus services.  Dublin Bus has told me that it faces challenges and we often hear television reports about bus provision throughout the city.  I am aware that vandalism takes place everywhere but I have never taken the view that bus services should be withdrawn from vulnerable communities just because some moron throws bricks.  There has to be a better way of resolving the matter.  I applaud the initiative taken by Dublin Bus in that regard while criticising its lack of thought and provision as far as planning is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, I was involved in previous incarnations of the Dublin transport authority.  I read with interest that the Green Party has taken an initiative on transport and I look forward to receiving a copy of it.  John Henry left South Dublin County Council to become involved in those bodies.  It is important that they have an input from local authority members, who sometimes receive a kicking.  I can be perfectly honest in that regard because I have no ambition to become a local authority councillor ever again.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">I am very happy in my position and I will not be returning to the local authority.  Deputy Durkan was a good local authority member, so he should not be knocking the role.  Local authority representatives see issues on the ground just as Deputies do, and they take the Luas and DART.  I often wonder why public representatives are excluded from certain bodies and I am glad that is not so in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">I cannot get my head around the fact that we have not yet devised an integrated ticketing system.  I understand the Department of Transport has spent money on solving the problems but we should be able to jump on the Luas or a bus in Tallaght and be able to visit the Zoo, Lansdowne Road when it is rebuilt, Croke Park or the north county with a single ticket.  I have been in other jurisdictions where this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">I am glad to have had this opportunity to make a brief contribution to an important debate for the Dublin region and the country as a whole.  If transport is properly provided in Dublin, it will help the rest of the country.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_655">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue which affects our daily lives.  Some of us have been around long enough to see how time has passed and the changes that have taken place.  I attended a public meeting several years ago at which a proposal was put from the floor on using the railway line and the canal for road transport.  Thankfully, the proposal was never proceeded with and the canal is now being used for leisure and amenity purposes.  In addition, the rail system that runs through the town in which I live, Maynooth, and various other places is being utilised in a way in which it was never previously used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">When we set about trying to achieve that to which I refer, every conceivable obstacle was placed in our path.  I include in this the suggestion that the railway line be concreted over and used for road transport.  It was first put to us that it would not be possible to run extra trains because the tracks were of the wrong type or were too narrow or because there was only a single line.  We were informed it would not be possible to do anything and that even if it were possible, people would not use the service.  We argued that if the service was provided, people would use it.  We also stated cognisance should be taken of the needs of the commuter as opposed to what was convenient for those responsible for drawing up timetables.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">With the passage of time, things have changed and it is now proposed to consider how best to meet the needs of commuters.  That is a good development.  I congratulate Iarnród Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and all those involved in the provision of public transport for addressing issues such as those to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">We are attending at the birth of another authority and it will be interesting to see what happens.  If it is to be effective, the authority will have to be powerful and there is no doubt it will clash with other agencies of the State.  The NRA and HSE do so on a regular basis.  It will not always be the case that the new authority will be correct either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Deputy O'Connor stated that public representatives will have an influence on the new authority.  I do not know how much influence they will have on it.  However, it is important to take account of the views of members of the public as expressed through their elected representatives.  This is not only good for such representatives, it is also good for democracy.  The latter is going out the window at a rapid rate, particularly at local level.  I refer in this regard to the activities of the NRA and certain local authorities, which seem to make decisions solely on the basis of technical information and regardless of what anyone else might have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The DTA will have an influence on the counties — Meath, Wicklow and Kildare — adjacent to Dublin and I hope this influence will be positive.  I also hope the DTA will recognise the needs of particular areas.  I recall it being stated some years ago that if traffic on the M50 moved any faster, it would lead to the creation of a traffic jam.  That statement was utter rubbish.  It was also stated that such a traffic jam would cause delays of up to two hours.  I recall similar statements being made in respect of certain stretches of the M50, particularly those at Palmerstown and the Red Cow roundabout.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Can someone indicate whether it will be possible to carry out some serious advance planning?  Will it be possible to employ an expert with knowledge of public transport and transportation in general?  Will advice be taken from such an individual?  Would it be possible to encourage him or her to visit some of the cities or towns throughout Europe which have solved their traffic problems and in which the authorities are able to convey many more people to and from work etc. than we do by way of a combination of public and private transport?</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Whenever any of us poor, unfortunate fools who are elected by the public raise questions we are told we do not really understand these matters and that they are extremely technical in nature.  Good reasons have always been given as to why we might not understand such matters and we came to the conclusion that we could not understand them.  However, it transpires that simple remedies will provide all the answers.  I cannot understand why we must spend so long beating down the door before the message gets through to those for whom it was originally intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The Dublin transport authority will be another large body.  It will be powerful.  As we move towards a situation where there will be a directly elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, the interaction between his or her office and the DTA, particularly in the context of the need for investment in infrastructure, will prove extremely interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">One of the aspects which must be borne in mind with regard to the capital and its environs is how to convey commuters quickly, safely, efficiently and effectively from locations outside the city to its centre and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are failing in respect of this matter at present and I do not know whether the Dublin transport authority will be able to do much about it.  We always seem to introduce stop-gap measures to solve serious problems.  There are countless instances where this has been done in the past five or ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">In the 1950s, the Naas dual carriageway was designed and built by people who were much less sophisticated than ourselves.  Engineers employed by the local authority were responsible for its construction.  The carriageway lasted from the 1950s to the 1980s and managed to accommodate traffic volumes in a way no major road development since has done.  No sooner was the famous M50 built than it was out of date.  No sooner was the upgraded road running from Lucan into the city opened than it was out of date.  When these projects were proceeding, questions should have been asked as to whether it would have been possible to put in place additional lanes or separate roads in order that vehicles would not all converge on the one spot.  I cannot understand why no one ever thought to ask these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">There are economies of scale and one can save money in the short term.  However, in the long term the story will be different.  There is a proposal to upgrade a road in my constituency that runs from Enfield to Edenderry.  This issue is giving rise to great emotion among members of the local community.  By the time the project is complete, the road will be out of date and will be incapable of accommodating the volume of traffic that will use it.  Anyone who wishes to monitor the position in respect of this road may do so and may return in five or six years to inform me that I was right.  I have no doubt this project is an absolute waste of money.  In addition, a different type of road structure should have been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">I understand a report was jointly published in the past couple of days by the Minister for Transport and his counterpart in Northern Ireland.  The report indicates a prescribed minimum height for trucks using tunnels and this is higher than the roof of the famous port tunnel.  How is it intended that traffic from the remainder of the country heading towards Dublin Port will negotiate the tunnel?  There are few options.  Either the floor of the tunnel can be lowered or the air can be let out of the tyres on larger vehicles in the hope that they might be able to pass through.  It is daft that this transport report, which was drawn up by the two Administrations on this island, has reached a conclusion regarding the minimum height for trucks using tunnels and that our most modern tunnel cannot accommodate these vehicles.  There will be a need for much more detailed reflection and debate on this matter in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I wish to refer to the modern trend in planning to house the maximum number of people in as close proximity as possible to public transport.  That is a good idea.  However, it does not necessarily mean that people's houses should be built on top of railway tracks.  People will have a reasonable quality of life if their houses are situated within walking distance of their local railway stations.  They should be able to walk there and back without difficulty.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">If the opportunity were open to me I would of course wish to move a Sinn Féin amendment to the motion.  As amended on our proposal, the substantive motion tabled by both the Fine Gael and Labour parties would read as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1069">That Dáil Éireann, noting:</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1071">the proposal to develop eight centres of excellence at various locations around the country;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1080">pending the establishment of a centre of excellence in the north east retain the Dóchas centre at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda as a satellite unit under the responsibility of the Beaumont centre of excellence;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1082">significantly enhance cross-Border co-operation between health services, maximising the health-care resources of Ireland as a whole, particularly in the development of cancer care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">Sinn Féin is supporting the substance of the motion in the name of the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies; what I have done is indicate additions to the motion as submitted.  We feel it is necessary to highlight the fact that the north-east region is also neglected under the current cancer strategy.  It is necessary to set out what we see as the solution for Letterkenny and to strengthen the call for the all-Ireland delivery of services. We of course fully support the retention and further development of cancer services in Sligo and Mayo and at the Dóchas centre in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">With regard to the plans to remove cancer services in Sligo, Mayo and Drogheda, we fully support their retention and commend local communities for campaigning to retain the services.  I reject the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, Professor Drumm and others to guilt-trip communities and their public representatives and suggest they are somehow being irresponsible for seeking the retention of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">We know from our experience in Monaghan what it is like to be at the receiving end of such an approach.  The proponents of total centralisation of all hospital care are far removed from the reality on the ground.  Part of that reality is patients dying because there is too great a distance to travel to hospital.  It means people choosing not to be treated or choosing less than optimum treatment in order to avoid the disruption to themselves and their families of travelling long distances for that treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Professor Keane is being repeatedly cited by the Minister and others as an all-knowing guru in terms of planning for cancer care.  His knowledge and experience are undoubted but he was brought in to implement a plan that was already in place.  The Government had already decided to provide only eight cancer centres, four of them in Dublin and none of them north of a line from Dublin to Galway.  This leaves large swathes of the country without proper access, and even in advance of full implementation of the plan, services at local hospitals are being cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The term "centres of excellence" has been bandied about and I emphasise again a point I made previously on this issue, most recently during the course of our statements last month on cancer reports.  We should start from the premise that every centre where cancer care of whatever type is delivered ought to be a centre of excellence.  By the Government and HSE placing the emphasis on eight centres only, they seek to promote the belief that care delivery at other sites must therefore be inferior.  That is a dangerous fallacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">Nobody is arguing for radiation oncology facilities and a full spectrum of other cancer services in every hospital in the country.  Eight centres with such facilities are too few and they are, as I and others have repeatedly pointed out, totally unbalanced in terms of regional spread, leaving much of the population very badly served or not served at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">It seems the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has her ears closed to these arguments.  Last night there was a very important debate on the Adjournment concerning the thousands of men and women in the north-east region who have received letters telling them their chest X-rays and CT scans must be reviewed.  They face a torturous two-month wait for results.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">Major questions are raised about the conduct of the HSE and the overall responsibility of successive Ministers, including Deputy Harney, and the Department of Health and Children.  Yet what did the Minister do yesterday evening at the end of the first part of this Private Members' business and with questions pending?  She left the Chamber with a Minister of State not a fortnight in office to take questions on her behalf.  That is consistent with the approach of this Minister and Government to health policy and management.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">The Minister for Health and Children would rather listen to corporate executives in the private health business and her HSE has awarded the contract for cervical cancer tests to Quest Diagnostics, a US company that has an unacceptably high rate of errors and has been convicted of fraud.</p>

If they vote for the Government amendment they are voting for the total centralisation of cancer services and the ending of services at Sligo, Mayo and the Dóchas centre in Drogheda.  That is effectively what they will be doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">They are voting for eight centres which will be overburdened and which will not provide comprehensive coverage across the country.  I appeal to those Government and Government-supporting Deputies to make a stand tonight and especially to those in the regions north of the Dublin-Galway line which are so badly served by this plan if it proceeds.  I ask them to listen to their communities and the frontline health care workers in their areas.  We should remember that each of us, as a Dáil Deputy, is a messenger of the people.  We have no monopoly on wisdom in respect of these matters.  We have no right to dictate to those who trusted their votes in us.  We have no right to act against the interests of the communities we are elected to serve.  A truly all-Ireland regionally based cancer treatment service is needed.  I commend such an approach to the Government, even at this late hour.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_1110">This debate is about the provision of cancer services.  The single most important person in the health service is the patient, or service user.  The health service must be geared to provide the best outcome for the patient.  That applies to the provision of cancer care as much as it does to any other area of health care.  It has been acknowledged by Members on all sides of the House that the outcome for a person in Ireland who unfortunately suffers from cancer is likely to be worse than the outcome for a person with the same cancer in most developed countries.  The area of paediatric cancer is an exception, however, as Ireland's results in that regard are as good as those in any other country.  All paediatric cancer surgery is done in Crumlin hospital.  It is obvious that the situation in relation to other cancers must be improved.  That is why the Government has developed a cancer care strategy.  The strategy has been drawn up, following widespread consultation, by an expert group consisting of 23 people.  As the Minister for Health and Children said last night, 17 of the people in question are medically trained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">The cancer strategy draws on the evidence of cancer care programmes throughout the world.  The development of cancer centres is at the core of the strategy.  The phrase "centre of excellence" has been used by some people.  However, I believe "cancer centre" to be a much better description of those locations where the specialised investigation and treatment of certain cancers will be carried out.  Professor Tom Keane, who is a world-renowned expert, has been appointed to implement the strategy.  I listened to an interview with Professor Keane on local radio last Monday when he explained in great detail how the centres will operate.  He outlined specifically how the centre for the west and north-west regions — Galway Regional Hospital — will relate to Mayo and Sligo general hospitals and their catchment areas.  The cancer strategy has been debated intensively since it was published.  Almost all the debate has been conducted in a reasoned and passionate manner that, quite rightly, reflects the sincerely held views of those involved in the discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">I worked as a general practitioner in Sligo town for many years prior to my election to the Dáil in 2002 and I know the staff of the surgical unit of Sligo General Hospital.  I am aware of their skill and dedication, having referred many patients to their care over the years.  They are committed health care professionals.  Like many people in the north west, they were disappointed to learn that initial assessment and surgery for breast cancer is to be conducted in a cancer centre.  As Professor Keane said, the best available medical evidence shows that patients who have their cancers assessed and surgically treated in cancer centres make better progress and enjoy better outcomes.  This important aspect of the debate must not be overlooked from the point of view of the patient.  The most important consideration must be the achievement of the best possible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Issues have been raised about the implementation of the cancer strategy.  Professor Keane has indicated that he is working to resolve such difficulties.  Among the issues is the provision of beds in Galway Regional Hospital.  People have also highlighted the difficulties encountered in travelling to Galway and back.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, referred last night to the need to provide more modern and convenient transport facilities.  After-care following surgery and chemotherapy for those who require it will continue to be available in Sligo.  Comments have been made about the supposed downgrading of Sligo General Hospital.  This is patently not the case.  Four new consultants have been appointed recently and they will take up their posts between January and June of this year.  A new medical assessment unit is currently being fitted out and is due to open in the near future.  A development control plan, which is examining the future development of Sligo General Hospital, is being compiled.  I understand that it will be available by the end of the year.  Government policy aims to provide the best outcomes for those who are afflicted with the terrible disease of cancer.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_671">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1114">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to contribute to this important debate on the national cancer strategy and cancer services generally.  This is a very emotive issue for some people.  Sensible and clear heads are needed if we are to solve the problems in this sector.  That is why I welcome the appointment of Professor Tom Keane.  It is important for politicians to make decisions, in line with best practice, in the interests of patients.  I welcome the decision to develop eight cancer care centres.  In particular, I welcome the inclusion of Beaumont Hospital, which is in my constituency, in the list of the centres.  It cannot end there, however.  All the people need to unite if a quality service is to be delivered.  When I speak about "all the people", I refer to cleaners, nurses, doctors, consultants, other staff, Deputies, councillors and everyone else who has a genuine interest in our health service.  We all need to work hard.  It is not up to somebody else to deliver on this issue, we all have to do our bit to ensure patients are put first, at the top of the queue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">We need to plan for the future.  The number of people with cancer will double over the next 15 years, mainly for demographic reasons.  There are 120,000 cancer survivors in Ireland at present.  They comprise 3.3% of the population.  These issues are covered in my agreement with the Taoiseach.  He recently signed an agreement that deals with these matters.  I also welcome the decision to allocate €15.9 million in grants and services to the people of Dublin North-Central in recent months.  The matters which comprise the broader issue are covered in section 5 of my agreement with the Taoiseach.  I warmly welcome the provision of €415 million for the implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology, which represents a serious investment in cancer services.  I welcome the additional funding of €15 million that has been provided for cervical cancer screening.  Those moneys have been provided in 2008 to meet the cost of the roll-out of the screening programme.  An additional 30 posts have also been approved.  In real terms, this means that a service can be provided to cater for 240,000 people per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">During this debate, we should remind ourselves of the need to consider what is good for patients.  We should remind everyone that good practice needs to be top of the agenda. Scoring political points will not improve the health service.  Work has begun on the major issues which need to be resolved.  We need reform, investment and change that is good for the people of this country.  Part of that change involves supporting the efforts of Professor Tom Keane to reform the health service.  The other part involves supporting the development of the eight cancer care centres.  I urge all Members of the House to vote to ensure we will have a top class health service of which we can all be proud.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_672">
          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1117">I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate.  I am glad that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is present.  I believe she is here to listen to us, and she does listen.  She comes to the Dáil to listen to Deputies.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we had a number of important meetings with the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I congratulate Deputy Moloney on being appointed as a Minister of State.  While he will be a loss to the joint committee, I welcome his appointment.  It is important that we acknowledge the efforts which have been made.  Like other Deputies, I acknowledge the progress that has been made by Professor Tom Keane.  I have met him on a number of occasions and I know he has a particular interest in what we are debating tonight, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I will be slightly parochial, like other speakers, by referring to excellent service being provided at Tallaght hospital.  The Minister is familiar with my concerns in this regard.  I remind the House that cancer care is part of the corporate hospital strategy that has been approved by the medical board and the hospital board.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country.  Over 1,500 new cases of cancer were treated at Tallaght Hospital in 2006.  I am told that this number is equivalent to the major Dublin teaching hospitals.  The Tallaght figure is larger than the equivalent figure for many of the hospitals which have been nominated as cancer care providers.  A full multidisciplinary team is present at Tallaght hospital to deal with all cancers.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to note my interest in my local hospital, which is working on behalf of people in the Dublin region as well as in counties Kildare and Wicklow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_673">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_1119">The words "confidence" and "trust" have been at the core of this debate.  The confidence we have in our services in Castlebar arises from the access patients have to it, particularly in urgent cases.  It also results from the ability and passionate interest of the surgeons in the unit and the quality of the after-care that is provided.  We fought to protect the current arrangement.  That debate and that fight took place against a backdrop of debate at both political and medical level about the impact of fragmentation of services on our current cancer policy and on the outcomes in Ireland.  Despite the strength of the unit in Mayo General Hospital, the figures presented to us by the Minister, Deputy Harney, by the National Cancer Registry of Ireland and the OECD show that our patient outcomes are not what they should and could be, and that is why the investment in this cancer strategy is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Speaking of figures, I ask the Minister to resolve the issue regarding the conflict between her figures and those from the hospitals in Mayo and, I gather, Sligo.  An independent investigator needs to be appointed to do that as soon as possible.  Unless we do that there will be no trust in a future system.  We can build trust in that new system if the same arrangements are in place for the transfer of patients to the centre in Galway, if beds are ring-fenced in Galway for patients from Mayo and Sligo and if oncology patients will not need to wait for a bed.  The 100 women who attend a clinic and the five who need a biopsy or follow-up should get a guarantee to be dealt with as soon as possible.  Each of those women who get a mammogram and a check-up in Galway should be seen on one day, as is committed to in the Government amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The Government amendment also commits that chemotherapy will still be performed on site at Mayo General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital, and that service will continue into the future, planned along the model, as mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, where it is planned centrally and delivered locally, thus avoiding the necessity for people to travel for chemotherapy, the worst part of cancer treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">I trust in the policy in the future.  I have confidence that this policy will not be initiated until Galway is ready, that the medical arrangements I have outlined are in place as has been guaranteed by Professor Keane when he addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children last December and that a fair, accessible and available transport service will be in place, not just from the various counties to Galway, but specific work needs to be done on a transport policy within Galway.  The current arrangements of parking at UCHG do not work and consideration needs to be given to a way of transporting patients across the city.  In the long term or even before that, consideration should be given to the location of oncology facilities at Merlin Park rather than dragging people across the city to UCHG.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">When Professor Keane addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in December he referred to the Canadian system of accommodation on site or near site for patients and their families.  I would like to see that system initiated in Ireland and support given to the Irish Cancer Society to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I have trust in the Minister.  Nobody has a monopoly on the impact of cancer or the understanding of that impact.  We need to ensure that through this policy that impact is reduced and that fewer people are impacted by cancer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1125">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  The national cancer strategy was formulated by medical consultants — the top experts in their chosen field.  They are people with no other agenda but to ensure that the disease of cancer could be contained and treated in the most effective way.  To them outcomes and locations are important.  What matters is that lives can be saved, the quality of life of cancer patients can be enhanced and survival rates can be improved.  Last night the Minister, Deputy Harney, stated that Ireland rates 18th out of 23 EU countries in terms of the one and five-year survival rates for breast cancer.  Sadly, even in the latest figures available from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland women in the west are showing survival rates that are 25% poorer than those for women on the east coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">I would like to recall the last Sunday in October when more than 7,000 people marched in a protest in Castlebar against the transfer of surgical services to Galway.  Seven very courageous women, many of whom are in the Gallery this evening, Mary McGreal, Mary Fahey, Ann McDonnell, Kathleen Warde, Mary Callanan, Teresa McDonnell and Ann Shields, all cancer survivors, organised and led the march because they had been treated excellently in Mayo General Hospital by Dr. Barry and his team, and they did not want to see that service lost to Mayo.  They were not alone.  I gave a pledge that day to do all in my power to retain those services in Castlebar.  I submitted a proposal which I brought to the HSE, the Minister and the then Taoiseach.  That plan would have seen Castlebar become an integral part of the Galway network.  Cancer surgery could be retained in Castlebar and Mayo patients would still have access to specialised services in Galway.  However, on 11 March the hospital manager, Tony Canavan, announced that he and his consultant colleagues——</p>

This was a decision made by clinical experts for very good reasons and I have no argument with it.  I admit I was disappointed, but I commend Tony Canavan on issuing a statement and explaining to the people of Mayo why they made their decision and expressing their disappointment at the loss of a valuable service to Mayo General Hospital.  I also commend the consultants for the clinical leadership they showed by putting the women of Mayo first.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">I want every woman in Mayo, whether a public or private patient, to have the same opportunity to get the best possible care available in Ireland for cancer.  They are entitled to a service that gives them the best chance of survival that this country has to offer.  What is planned is that a woman would have her initial diagnosis and surgery in Galway.  There will be a Mayo clinic within the Galway clinic with designated theatre and clinic times.  There will be ring-fenced beds for Mayo patients.  The clinic will be managed by Mayo staff, with the same consultants and the same staff, maintaining the valuable relationships and personal contact that women enjoy in Mayo General Hospital.  They will not be just numbers, they will be people and they will have that personal contact.</p>

This is the commitment that the Taoiseach and the Minister have given in the House.  All follow-up activity will take place in Mayo General Hospital.  There is a proposal to enhance the oncology unit in Mayo General Hospital.  Space has already been identified and work on the proposal is ongoing.  This will enhance the service of chemotherapy at Mayo General Hospital.  It will be centrally planned but locally delivered.  It will be a consultant-led service.  The proposal to develop the service in Mayo General Hospital over time will result in greater medical oncology presence on site at the hospital than currently exists.

          <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1146">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak tonight.  I had been involved in and was very committed to the campaign to retain breast cancer surgery in Sligo General Hospital in recent months.  With my colleagues, I lobbied the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and wrote to Professor Tom Keane and the HSE.  I also worked very closely with my constituents on the issue.  The people of Sligo and Leitrim, myself included, felt very passionately that we were well served by our local hospital in this regard.  It is with great disappointment that I acknowledge in the House tonight before the local campaign group that my efforts have not been successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">I must accept, however, that international best practice dictates that the best outcome for patients are achieved in clinical centres of excellence.  That has been a very difficult decision to accept and it has been a very tough few weeks for me, both politically and personally.  I am supporting the strategy because it is the right thing to do.  The cancer control strategy is in the best interest of patients.  It puts the patients' safety first.  As an elected representative it is my duty to put the safety and best interests of my constituents first regardless of how unpopular that might make me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Last night the Minister spoke about the improvement in patient outcomes that has been achieved by specialising brain surgery and paediatric cancer services in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  This model is operating with considerable success whereby every child who develops cancer has his or her diagnosis established and treatment planned at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.  For many children, significant components of their treatment are delivered by one of 16 local hospitals under the supervision of, and in accordance with, the care protocols agreed with Crumlin hospital.  In the same way, chemotherapy and other post-surgery treatment will be delivered in Sligo.  Hence I am confident that the establishment of the cancer control networks will deliver the same results for those suffering with cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">No services should be moved from Sligo to Galway until all necessary facilities are in place.  It is vital that capacity, consultants, beds and parking facilities are all set up in advance of any move.  That is important for patients' safety and is necessary in order for people in Sligo and Leitrim to buy into the strategy.  I have received assurances that Sligo patients will be able to avail of treatment in Dublin should they so wish.  That is an option that may suit some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">We have a duty to ensure that our health service delivers the best possible care for public patients.  Private patients have a choice to go wherever they wish.  Cancer affects people from all walks of life and from all income brackets.  No cancer patients should suffer further because they do not have health insurance.  Public patients must have the same access to expert medical advice and be given the same chances as the 60% of the population who now have private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">I was honoured to be elected by the people of Sligo-North Leitrim to represent them in Dáil Éireann.  I have served my constituents honestly and tirelessly.  I have made their views known to Government and to stakeholders and I will continue to do so from within Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The national cancer control strategy is not based on geographic locations, but on population centres.  An independent report on the issue found that women treated in specialist centres in Dublin have a 25% better survival rate than women treated outside a specialist cancer centre.  As the Minister indicated last night, that means that where four women in a specialist centre in Dublin will survive, only three women who have been treated elsewhere will survive.  In supporting the strategy, I am supporting better outcomes for women with breast cancer in both Sligo and Leitrim and throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1178">I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  The information on cancer that is available predicts that the number of people with cancer will double in the next 15 years.  That is a disturbing prediction in terms of the impact it will have not just on society, but on our entire culture.  If we do not address the issue now, it is difficult to understand how we will be able to cope with such an increase in cancer in 15 years.  A concise and coherent strategy needs to be put in place, backed up with an action plan.  The appropriate funding needs to be put in place also.  The strategy must be focused on the best outcome for patients.  As other speakers have said, patients must be at the centre of the process.  The strategy must be patient-focused and it must look at the potential to save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">A number of Deputies said this issue was about women's lives.  Clearly, cancer affects people across the population and has the potential to double in numbers.  The strategy is about saving those lives and we have an opportunity to put it in place.  I fully support the plan as outlined by Professor Keane.  If we do not take the type of approach he suggests, we will have a serious problem within 15 years.  If that happens, the problem will continue with no input from this House or proper planning.  This side of the House is often accused of not putting in place clear strategies and we are accused also of not setting out strategies prior to this one.  When the Government does that, it is still accused of not getting it right.  What is most important is the outcome for the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">From a constituency point of view, the strategy does not propose that a cancer treatment centre should be located in County Clare.  However, we are pretty well served by access to both Galway and Limerick and that is welcome.  I have sympathy with those areas that are losing cancer services.  It is extremely difficult from a political point of view.  When I first learned that Ennis General Hospital would lose its mammography services, I, too, was deeply concerned but, like others, when I sought the advice of clinicians and consultants it was clear that, apart from any local political issue, the best outcome from the patients' point of view was to travel to either Limerick or Galway.  The reason is that enough patients were not using the service in Ennis to keep the skill levels of those utilising the equipment up to speed or to keep the system or the machinery calibrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">I support the strategy that is being adopted.  I support the Minister wholeheartedly in the efforts she is making.  She has been a pillar of strength in regard to this matter. She has assisted all of us in terms of the difficulties we had in coming to an understanding of the reason the strategy must be put in place.  I support her in that regard.</p>

I will first examine the two key ideas behind the proposed eight centre model of breast cancer care.  The report on services for breast disease, dated March 2000, recommended 14 breast cancer centres, including one at Sligo General Hospital.  Why then has the recent cancer strategy reduced the number of centres to eight?</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">Two particular figures are widely used to justify the proposed eight centre model.  One figure suggests that the specialised breast units have a 20% improved survival rate.  The other figure suggests that a specialist breast cancer unit must have 150 or more new cases per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Of the 20% improved survival figures, the report on the development of services for breast disease in 2000 stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1187">Evidence demonstrating correlation between workload . . . and survival exists.  In some cases, a 20% improved survival has been noted in patients treated in specialised Breast Units compared to those not treated in such centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The use of the words "in some cases" does not convey a point of sufficient substance to justify the national strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">On the point that a specialised breast cancer unit must have 150 or more new cases per year, let us examine the origin of that figure.  It comes from the breast unit guidelines issued by the European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists.  The paper states that a breast unit must have a critical mass of a medical specialist, including two breast surgeons, two radiologists and two pathologists.  The paper adds that such a unit is expensive and therefore must have a high throughput of patients, leading to the figure of 150 or more new breast cancer cases.  In other words, first staff the unit then look for the patients.  A Government strategy for cancer care must consider all the factors, including geography.  The paper also states that individual breast cancer surgeons must personally carry out the primary surgery in at least 50 breast cancers per year to maintain expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">Sligo General Hospital reported 70 new breast cancer cases in 2006 and 95 in 2007 to the cancer registry in Cork — these are certified figures — and expects to report more than 100 new cases this year.  The hospital inpatient inquiry scheme database cites the total number of breast cancer surgical procedures carried out at Sligo General Hospital as 65 in 2005, 57 in 2006 and more than 80 in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">A recent study carried out by senior medical staff at Sligo General Hospital compared outcomes for breast cancer patients in Sligo General Hospital with outcomes for patients in the SEER database.  That is the largest United States database and is generally recognised as a gold standard to use when comparing outcomes.  That paper clearly demonstrates that the outcomes for Sligo patients are either identical or superior to those achieved in the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">That hospital study has the up to date figure.  The very old, if not ancient, comparison figures used by the Minister last night in the House have no validity.  I am astonished that she came into the House for this debate and gave figures that are eight years old.  That is appalling.  Likewise, her figures on the 20% recovery rate were equally appalling as that data is eight years old also.  Closing down cancer centres with a few cases does not apply to Sligo General Hospital.  The current caseload, the record of successful outcomes and the expertise of the multidisciplined team fully justifies a centre in Sligo General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">The current cancer strategy is the recommendation of an expert group.  In recommending an eight centre model, with four of the proposed centres being located in Dublin, the purely scientific analysis went out the window.  If the science behind Professor O'Higgins's report was rigorously applied, there would be just one, and possibly two, breast cancer care facilities in Dublin.  In the case of Dublin, the science was complemented by a political judgment to arrive at four centres.  Policy in national health care is a political matter.  TDs represent the people.  It is our job to reflect the will of the people, and we have the will of the people in the Gallery tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Governments request advice from experts.  We have plenty of experts in this Government — €1 million per week is spent on experts and consultants — but trade-offs require political balancing and that can only be done by elected politicians.  It is the job of experts to advise; it is the job of Government to decide.  Let us be clear about where the responsibility for the downgrading of Sligo General Hospital lies.  It lies with this Government and its Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">The proposed eight centre model examines the problem of cancer care solely from the perspective of the disease and its treatment.  Cancer is not a simple disease.  Effective treatment is not just about dealing with abnormal cells.  Cancer care is about healing the total person.  The good news is that cancer is more survivable than ever but even in the best case the disease is a heavy burden on all those affected.  We must go beyond just treating the disease and address all the needs of the patients, their families and friends if the treatment of the patient is to be fully successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">The Minister for Health and Children has stated that the key objectives of the national cancer control programme are to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient survival, irrespective of geography.  Irrespective of geography indeed.  The people of Dublin are not expected to travel to another hospital approximately 10 km from their home for cancer care but the Minister sees no difficulty asking people in the north west to travel up to 250 km or more from their homes for cancer treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">For patients, families and friends, ease of getting to and from hospitals is a serious problem that must be fully considered.  The decision to close cancer services at Sligo General Hospital ignores the cancer care for the population north of a line from Galway to Dublin.  That is not acceptable.  The strategy runs counter to all the Government's talk of regional development and is seen in the region as having a cross-Border dimension.  Speaking at a recent conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that mainstreaming North-South co-operation is a central part of policy delivery in every Department.  Talk is cheap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">The Minister for Health and Children has stated that the potential for further cross-Border co-operation on cancer care would be progressed through a North-South feasibility study.  The population of County Fermanagh has the potential to contribute to the population base for a centre of care in Sligo.  It would be a monumental tragedy for the region to have cancer services removed from Sligo General Hospital only to discover next year that a cross-Border regional review of cancer needs further confirms the case for a cancer treatment centre in Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">The cancer care strategy now being implemented is seriously and fundamentally flawed.  Equity of access cannot be delivered by ignoring geography.  The current strategy ignores the breast cancer care needs of the entire population north of a line from Galway to Dublin.  Currently, 4,000 mammograms and 2,000 colorectal examinations are carried out at Sligo General Hospital.  If the breast cancer care services are removed, all oncology services will be removed.  I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, that what is left will not be worth talking about.</p>

          <p eId="para_1220">I want to tell the Minister why the women and people of Mayo have no confidence in her and no confidence in going to Galway.  I shall give two or three simple examples.  There is a woman in the Visitors Gallery tonight who had to go on local radio this morning, crying and praying for her loved one, who is in a very bad state in Mayo General Hospital for the last number of weeks, waiting for a bed in Galway.  If that operation could have been carried out in Mayo General Hospital, it would have been done.  I had a simple case in my constituency, which I shall again put on the record of the Dáil.  A woman was called for oncology service for next September, although she has been dead for 17 years.  Yet the Minister expects the women of County Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny to believe she is offering them a better service in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">I know the Minister was aggravated the last time I mentioned that Professor Tom Keane was on €600,000 to do the job.  If the man was committed to staying here and ensuring this was going to work, I should have some respect for and actually believe the Minister.  However, he will draw down the money, set up the service and, like the Minister for Health and Children, he will have no accountability for anything.  He will have no accountability because he will be back in Canada again, and when we table Dáil questions to see how this system is operating and how Professor Keane is doing, we will be told he is no longer here.</p>

We have excellent surgeons in Mr. Kevin Barry, Dr. Mary Casey and Mr. Ronan Waldron and the Minister is now going to remove our surgeons from Mayo to Galway, although Galway cannot cope as it is.  She expects our women to believe her when she says the service is Galway will be better than they are getting in Mayo General Hospital.  That is why they are here tonight, because they know what they have and they cannot believe any more promises from Fianna Fáil, the PDs or this Government supported by the ragbags of Independents, because they do not believe them any more.</p>

It is a question of confidence at a time when patient confidence is at an all-time low.  I have questions to ask on behalf of my constituents and the general public.  Will Government policy on cancer services be of a high quality, co-ordinated and efficient?  If past performance is an indicator of the future, I doubt it very much.  Will services be population or patient focused?  The irony of centralising cancer care is that members of the predominantly healthy 25-44 age group live in the suburbs of these proposed centres, whereas the predominantly ageing population are in the peripheral rural areas.  How does international best practice in advanced nations align itself to Ireland's situation?  All things being equal, it fits well.  However, given the Third World transport infrastructure in this country, all things are not equal.  In terms of a cancer vision, will there be a clear direction that improves the patient's journey?  I do not mean a journey on the back of a bus or in an ambulance.  I mean a patient's journey from screening to diagnosis to rehabilitation and recovery.  The people of the north west do not share the Minister's confidence in the vision she holds at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">I want to discuss cancer services at Letterkenny General Hospital.  Having secured outreach status from University Hospital Galway, the cancer team at Letterkenny is developing all the time.  At present, we have three pathologists, three specialists in neurology, a permanent oncologist, a locum oncologist and a soon to be appointed breast care surgeon, proving that multidisciplinary team meetings are possible with the assistance of advanced communications technology.  As the Minister will be aware, every Thursday meetings take place via telelinks to discuss mammograph, ultrasound and biopsy results through advanced communications technology.

Serious questions arise over determining a suitable location for a radiotherapy service and the people on both sides of the Border have not been consulted.  While we are told a feasibility study is ongoing, the details are sketchy.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, are meeting but it is not advisable to pinpoint a location without prior investigation after only two meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">The focus of this motion is on patient care and the cancer patient journey.  While we accept on this side of the House that specialist cancer surgery requires a conglomeration of experts at a fixed location to where people will travel, there are other elements to cancer recovery that the Government is failing to consider.  This is where the Government is losing the argument.  So much can happen locally in conjunction with local hospitals with respect to negotiation with general practitioners.  I refer to prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, supportive care and palliative care.  These comprise the vision on paper but, in reality, the people do not have confidence in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">I cite an example of a woman who went for a mammogram last week in Letterkenny General Hospital.  While waiting for her test results for 15 minutes, 14 women went for mammograms.  I know this because the woman in question was my mother.  She went for a check on her own initiative as a private patient because there is no BreastCheck service in the north west.  How in the name of God does the Minister expect one centre in Galway to look after the whole north west if 14 women are going through the system in Letterkenny in a 15-minute period?  As the Minister well knows, the clinic in question is now operating on a Saturday as well as from Monday to Friday.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1249">The treatment of cancer is but one of many crises erupting almost daily in the health service.  To name but a few, there are serious problems with waiting lists and critically ill patients lie on trolleys for days; patients are being misdiagnosed; there is a scandal over hospital bugs, including MRSA; there are cutbacks in essential services such as the home help scheme and services for the disabled; and there is a nursing home scandal.  The litany of failures is almost endless.  The availability of cancer treatment concerns us most.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">Cancer is the health scourge of the 21st century and it is the most unwelcome illness of all.  Unfortunately we can expect it to come knocking on our door sooner or later.  Very few families have not been affected directly or indirectly.  It can be devastating to be diagnosed with cancer.  In this regard, I need only mention the late Nuala O'Faolain and how she reacted to her terrible diagnosis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">However, we all agree on one point, that the best possible treatment should be available for those who are struck by the dreadful disease.  There is general agreement that centres of excellence are the best way forward in providing treatment.  The Government's policy in designating centres of excellence is fundamentally flawed in that it lacks geographic balance.  It is a spectacular oversight to leave almost half of this country without even one such centre.  North of the Dublin-Galway line, there is a barren desert as far as the strategy is concerned.  There will be no centres of excellence in that region.  Even worse, there are definite plans to dilute the already existing cancer services in places such as Sligo.  That part of the country represents almost 20% of the State's population.  On a <i>per capita</i> basis, the region should be entitled to two centres of excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">Not alone is the north left without a centre of excellence but the BreastCheck programme has not yet been extended thereto.  Although the Minister announced more than a month ago expenditure of €10 million on digital mammography services, it is unbelievable that BreastCheck has not yet been made available in the north west, including Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">I welcome the decision to have a satellite unit in Letterkenny General Hospital under the responsibility of the Galway centre of excellence.  However, I urge the Minister to ensure the facility is provided immediately.  All those in south Donegal are dependent on the cancer treatment facilities in Sligo General Hosptial.  An excellent service, in terms of diagnosis and treatment, is being provided under the wise guidance of Professor Tim O'Hanrahan.  The people of south Donegal are shocked and opposed to any reduction or withdrawal of cancer services in Sligo General Hospital.  They want the services to be retained and enhanced.  There is no reason Sligo should not have a satellite facility associated with Galway in which to deliver treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">Our aim should be to provide treatment to patients as near to their homes as possible.  The designation of Galway as a centre of excellence for all the west will create a logistical nightmare.  Transport from the north to Galway is completely inadequate.  There are no train or air services and this makes matters extremely difficult for patients suffering from cancer.  As other Members stated, the circumstances in Galway create further difficulties in that basic facilities such as parking spaces are not available.  All of these factors lend support to having an additional centre in the north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">There is a complete absence of radiotherapy services in north Donegal and this represents the remaining gap to be filled.  I made one of my regular visits to St. Luke's Hospital last night.  Before I entered at all, I met three patients from Donegal, two male and the other female.  The latter was a 34-year-old mother whose children were at home, yet she was spending seven or eight weeks in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Negotiations are taking place at political level between North and South and I urge the Government and HSE to bring them to a conclusion as soon as possible.  Patients from my part of the country should not have to travel 200 miles for six, seven or eight weeks.  The service they require should be provided in their own region.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_1257">I speak from the Galway perspective and will outline the difficulty the Minister's proposal will create at University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG.  Already this year there are proposals for closure of some wards and theatres at the hospital for the month of August, basically due to financial considerations.  If a centre of excellence is to be provided in Galway, which, as stated in our motion, we support, funding will have to be ring-fenced for the purpose.  Our motion states existing safe and high-quality cancer services should be retained at Mayo and Sligo general hospitals and that all centres of excellence and satellite units should be subject to an annual audit by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Despite assurances by speakers on the Government side, such a system is not in place.  This is the crux of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">I cannot understand how the plans for an expanded centre of excellence will work at UCHG.  Already the staff — including doctors and nurses — is working under severe strain.  Our spokesperson on health, Deputy Reilly, outlined some figures in the debate last night that merit repeating.  He quoted the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1259">We enclose the figures for the number of patients waiting on trolleys for an inpatient bed in the [emergency department] at UHG for the month of April 2008.  You will see that this month we have had a total of 444 patients on trolleys at 9 am [throughout the month].  This compares to a total of 188 for the same period in 2007.  This is an increase of 136% at a time when the HSE is meant to be moving towards a zero tolerance for trolley waits in Emergency Departments, as recommended by the Task Force Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Deputy Reilly suggested that the overcrowding at UCHG is seriously affecting patient care, as I know from experience.  Overcrowding and the placing of patients on trolleys has been highlighted continuously by me and the staff at the hospital over several years.  Despite our best efforts, no steps have been taken to address this serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">To give an example of how circumstances are worsening, in the first four months of this year there were 1,283 patients on trolleys at 9 a.m. compared to 890 for the same period last year.  The problem is getting worse by the day.  All those patients were on trolleys overnight, in some cases for more than 30 hours.  How does the Minister propose to eliminate this serious situation before she creates a centre of excellence?  This is the crucial question for Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">At present, one cannot get into the car park at the hospital at any time of the day without encountering serious queuing delays.  Alternatively, one is obliged to drive out of the city to park and then walk or get a taxi to the hospital.  There is double parking, parking on yellow lines etc. and one cannot park a bicycle at the hospital at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">The centre of excellence should have been built as a purpose-built building at Merlin Park Hospital, where facilities would be available and where all the major roads lead——</p>

          <p eId="para_1266">This debate reminds me of the cancer debate that took place in the midlands during the 1990s.  The difference is that the then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, outlined that strategy and his Government's Deputies and councillors opposed it.  Consequently this debate is nothing new.  It pertains to independent medical advice from the National Cancer Forum, which I fully support this evening as I then did.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Peculiarly, the same players are involved, namely, the patient, who often is forgotten, the Government, the National Cancer Forum, the public and politicians.  The same three issues operate this evening as was the case then, that is, location, location, location.  Nothing much has changed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">The arguments in support of the National Cancer Forum remain the same.  Regardless of people talking about political involvement and people being under pressure, the same three issues jump out at me this evening as in 1997.

In the report's executive summary, it does not say that only eight centres should be established.  The exact words used are "about eight such centres".  Again, recommendation No. 28, after discussing the question of volume and the size of population necessary to support a centre, uses the phrase "about eight such centres".  Therefore, the obduracy in being unwilling to move from eight centres to a ninth, the case having being made, must be justified.

          <p eId="para_1311">I do not believe the Minister for Health and Children can, within the Constitution, resile from obligations on a rights basis, a point I have made elsewhere.</p>

Therefore, the onus is on the Minister to justify the inflexibility that is being imposed by way of a recommendation to the HSE.  Again the advice of a former Attorney General on this point was that no Minister — I have been a Minister — can hand to an agency responsibilities that are constitutionally the responsibilities of that Minister.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1315">The difficulty with the HSE is that it is not proofing its proposals for budget balancing against the rights that already are there under the Health Acts and which are available to citizens.  The HSE has no right simply to state it intends to balance its budget.  It is open to citizens to test this in the courts and it is my hope they will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">One of the great difficulties in this regard, irrespective of who is Minister for Health and Children, is that without a floor that accepts the constitutional guarantee to a minimum of health care available to all citizens on an equal basis, one cannot have a policy.  This brings one to the issue of the arbitrary figure.  In fairness to the national cancer forum, it did not specify 500,000 people.  It suggested "about 500,000" people and discussed the case above and below the limit.  Consequently, those who wish to take the suggested approximate figures contained in the report in black and white and suggest they are absolutes again are resiling from the report itself.  A logical case has been made and the most reasonable response to this week's debate would be to return to the report and take the interpretation that is possible by offering a ninth centre, given the strong case that has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">I repeat that it has been pointed out empirically that the alternative is to impose an unfair burden on those who already are over-burdened in Galway.  This is the reason that when one talks of equality of access, one must take into account the road structure, the amount of time spent travelling and the delivery of the service.  We went through this before when we discussed neurosurgery and the right of regions to deliver equality of access to medical rights for their citizens.  That is why, even at this stage, I appeal to those speaking on the Government side to at least consider the case supported in the report——</p>

When the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, came into this House on his first day in office, he said we should not be obliged and restricted by the acceptance of independent reports.  He said we should have the courage to change them if we believe they are not correct.  He said he gave a declaration to the people of south Offaly that the constituency boundary was never breached since the foundation of the State.  This is an opportunity for the Government to show the courage he speaks of because this is not only a medical position but a political decision and the Minister knows it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1331">I am appalled at the attitude of Government Deputies who said this fight was lost when statements were issued by management.  Members of hospital management do the jobs they are supposed to; politicians reflect the views of the people and make political decisions in the best interests of the community.  I inform the Minister, Deputy Harney, that I would not stand here and defend this motion in the name of Fine Gael if I did not believe that the standards of surgery, clinical outcome and survival stand up.  The Minister has not proven anything in this debate to date to demonstrate that the service in Sligo or in Mayo General Hospital should not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">Last week, I met Professor Keane and when I told him that Letterkenny is being set up as a satellite entity on geographical grounds, rather than medical grounds, he said: "I am very upset about this."  He is here as a facilitator to implement a Government policy that has been handed to him.  Whether there were ten, five or 20 centres he would implement the policy and the Minister knows this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">When Deputy Bertie Ahern came before the House on his last day as Taoiseach, he said he had made representations to Professor Keane and they could not be changed.  Who, in the name of God, is in charge in this country?  The reason these people are in the Gallery is that they do not believe the Minister, Deputy Harney, anymore and I will tell her why this is the case.  This morning, I spoke of people with no voice — those in palliative care, those who need psychiatric assessments and those under the charge of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, who vowed to get back the €25 million that was allocated to the Minister but has not been spent on front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">The Minister can carry this message to the Taoiseach — his vow to Deputy Reilly that he would silence me in this House will not be carried through.  I will not be beaten down in standing up for those with no voice or in outlining the case for people who need and deserve services and who have had the services they receive stripped away.</p>

We will have transport arrangements, new facilities and a Mayo clinic in Galway, although there is no mention of a Sligo clinic in Galway.  All of these wonderful things will happen before the service moves.  Today's letter from the HSE to me states: "It is agreed that the transfer of breast cancer services from Castlebar hospital will occur in early September 2008."  That is 14 weeks away.  The letter goes on to state: "The national cancer control programme has committed not to move the service until we are satisfied that the quality of the service and access to that service is at least comparable to what is currently available in Castlebar."  It states "at least comparable to what is currently available", but the Minister told us that this service will be demonstrably better than any service in Mayo or Sligo.  This is palpably not the case and the Minister is not being true to either her political remit or her ministerial responsibilities.</p>

She said she would have even more clout as an independent and on 5 March she made her clarion call when she said the only plan on the table was hers.  She said: "I am now calling for a united approach to honouring that promise and I know that I speak for the people of Mayo in calling on my Oireachtas colleagues to back my proposal and to display the unity of purpose which the people of Mayo have a right to expect."

          <p eId="para_1354">We are wasting more time.  I had a speech prepared to outline why the Minister's figures are wrong but I outlined that last night.  I have an e-mail from Miriam Wiley of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and I will read part of it.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1355">Where there is discrepancy between data reported the only way that that can be resolved is by access to the two sources.  In this instance it seems to me that would mean that the data source for the hospital would need to clarify how the findings reported there were reached and likewise the Department of Health and Children would need to clarify the process involved in identifying the data reported from that source.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">The data source for the hospital has clarified how the findings reported there were reached.  It is implicit that the ESRI can only collate what is transmitted to it and what has been transmitted to it is incorrect regarding Mayo General Hospital.  If this has been replicated around the country, the implications are obvious.  We are planning a health service on misinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Why does the Minister persist in using figures from the years 1994 to 2001 to compare outcomes for women on the west coast to those of women on the east coast when there was no breast cancer service, no surgeon and no oncologist in these areas until 2000?</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">If one checks the figures relating to five years survival in breast cancer patients for 2002, one finds that the rate is 88%, which exceeds the European average as reported in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i> last year.  It also compares favourably to American data.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">I pointed out that there is more than one way to deliver a centre of excellence.  It can be done in the absolute fashion chosen by the Minister or it can be done through satellites, as the Sloan-Kettering hospital in New York has done, as mentioned by Deputy Flynn.  In these areas all patients before they commence treatment are discussed by the entire team at both the centre and the satellite and this is what gives the best outcome.  The Government has already opted for this option in Letterkenny. I have further outlined the appalling record of the Government in keeping its word and the record of the HSE and its ability to deliver safe, effective and timely health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">I mentioned a transport system based on volunteerism.  Only this morning we had a heated debate between the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the Taoiseach, who failed to answer the question of what has happened to funds allocated by the Government through the Department to the HSE for specific purposes.  This money was designated for the hospice and the mental health services but was hived off for other uses.</p>

This was money which would have given people who were terminally ill some comfort and dignity at the end of their days, money which could have improved the appalling state of our mental health services.  No one asked for extra money, just that the money allocated would go to the purpose for which it was designated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">During the course of that debate the Taoiseach indicated that he would silence the Opposition.  We know from comments made off the record how dearly he loves us and how highly he holds us in esteem, but I guarantee he will not silence the Opposition because we live in a democracy.</p>

The people of Letterkenny are evolving their own model.

The number of overnight stays in April 2008, as mentioned, increased by 136% compared to the same month in 2007.  According to the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, if we extrapolate these figures to the rest of the country, we find that 360 people are dying unnecessarily every year.

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1656">The decision of the Government to reject Waterford Wedgwood's request for State guarantees on loans of €39 million is unimaginative and potentially devastating to the Waterford area.  The live register for the Waterford area stood at 6,586 in April 2008, an increase of 1,288 on the figure of 5,298 in April 2007.  The restructuring package for Waterford Crystal in Kilbarry includes a redundancy programme to eliminate 490 jobs.  The short-time working arrangements which will operate at the Kilbarry plant for three weeks in the next two months is a further negative development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">Without loan guarantees, the future of the remaining 550 jobs must be a matter of serious concern.  UNITE has given its full support to the company's request for loan guarantees, which it made because it is unable to raise finance of its own accord.  Reports suggest that the European Commission would not veto State aid in response to the company's request.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to clarify whether the rejection of the application was purely a Government decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">The decision to reject guaranteeing loans of up to €39 million is incredible in the context of the 550 jobs that are at stake.  It would cost the IDA multiples of that figure to develop a similar number of jobs in Waterford.  The Government is displaying unimaginative conservatism, given that Waterford Wedgwood could trade out of difficulties, in which case it would not draw upon the loan guarantees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">The US is Waterford Crystal's main market, but because the dollar is extremely weak there has been a significant reduction in earnings from the company's products.  Americans tend not to travel in years when there is a presidential election in their country.  This is affecting the Irish market.  A new US president will be elected in the autumn and this gives strong grounds for optimism that confidence in the American economy will be boosted and that consumer spending will increase.  This would be a basis for Waterford Crystal to trade its way out of difficulty.  If, however, the Government does not review this awful decision, the knock-on effects for the Waterford area will be unthinkable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The Government continues to refuse to process Waterford Institute of Technology's application to upgrade in order that it might become the university of the south east so that Waterford and the surrounding region could obtain their fair share of jobs and development in the knowledge economy and enhance the region's capacity for research and development.  The Government is effectively turning its back on the future development and prosperity of the south-east region, where the traditional industrial base is being eroded and where alternative job creation is not being promoted to anywhere near an adequate level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">The argument is advanced that if the Waterford Wedgwood application is granted, many similar applications will emerge.  This is just a cover for inaction and a lack of courage and initiative.  The Government's offer to assist the company in ways other than the loan guarantees is a pathetic and meaningless gesture.  The reported Government belief that Waterford Crystal has a sound future rings hollow against the rejection of the loan guarantees application.  Surely a company which has a sound future but which is experiencing short-term difficulties more than merits loan guarantees to the extent of €39 million in order that 550 jobs can be protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The job losses are the first and major issue but the consequent and significant negative spin-off affects for the local economy must also be factored in.  A blinkered approach without flair or imagination, as represented in the Government's rejection, isinappropriate and unacceptable.  Job protection and retention in this growing economic recession requires a Government capable of thinking outside the box and dealing with today's problem immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Applications for aid on the part of industrial concerns that may or may not be made in the future must be dealt with on their merits.  The Waterford Crystal case has unanswerable merit and logic to it.  I call on the Minister to encourage the Government to engage in a positive review of this decision in order to avoid a potential unemployment and economic catastrophe for the Waterford area.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_860">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1664">I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this important matter.  For some months the Government has engaged with the management of Waterford Wedgwood plc, following a request from the company for support to assist in the implementation of its restructuring plan.  The support sought was to fund planned restructuring in Waterford Crystal, which would involve approximately 500 redundancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">Owing to the fact that Waterford Crystal is a major Irish employer, with an internationally recognised brand and a solid history of exporting achievement, particularly in the US market, the Government was most anxious to ensure that its request for assistance received the fullest consideration.  Accordingly, detailed discussions were held with the company with a view to identifying possible interventions that would assist it in successfully completing the planned restructuring in Waterford, while not undermining the policy position that has underpinned our enterprise development strategies in the past two decades.  It was not possible to accede to the company's request.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">The thrust of enterprise strategy, adhered to by all Governments during the past 20 years or so, is to concentrate State support to firms for investments that will help them to compete successfully in an increasingly globalised economy.  The Government sees its role as helping to create an economic environment where business can prosper and focus on interventions that are related to developmental investment by companies, such as research and development grants, support for upskilling, etc.  Such a policy does not extend to providing the type of support sought by the company in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The effects of globalisation are felt in even the smallest markets and global competition will intensify and extend its reach.  The Government has recognised the inevitable changes taking place across world markets for both trade and investment.  Enterprise policies aimed at equipping companies with the ability to compete better in world markets, capture the opportunities from globalisation and build competitive advantage in innovation and knowledge have been central to policy development.  The best response to globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Our attractions include a competitive tax and regulatory environment, a well-educated workforce, a rapidly improving infrastructure and a commitment to world-class standards of research, development and innovation.  Maintaining and improving upon these standards is vital to sustaining Ireland's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">While it has not been possible to accede to the company's request for support in this case, the Government believes that there is a solid future for a restructured Waterford Crystal operation in Ireland and asks that the board of Waterford Wedgwood, its management and staff work together to agree such financial and other measures as are necessary for the successful implementation of the restructuring plan.  Any request or proposal from the company for aid for new investment will be considered sympathetically by the enterprise development agencies as appropriate.  I am confident the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies will continue to support enterprise development and job creation in the Waterford area.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1669">I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the case of one of my constituents.  My constituent was refused the respite care grant for the 2006-07 period, despite the existence of incontrovertible medical evidence from two family doctors.  This case was previously raised by Deputies Kenny and Durkan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">The constituent to whom I refer cares for his 83-year-old mother, who requires full-time care, and his brother, who is a cancer patient.  As my constituent provides constant care to his mother and brother, he is unable to take up employment.  I am familiar with this case and I have good reason to believe that the evidence provided by my constituent at the oral hearing relating to the case did not represent an accurate account of the level of care he provides to his family.  The man in question was extremely nervous and did not relate the real story.  He appealed the decision to refuse the respite care grant but this appeal was rejected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">My constituent is under considerable stress as a result of being obliged to care for his mother and brother, while being unable to earn a full-time living from work.  He has been on medication due to this difficult situation and the level of stress that results from it.  Two family doctors have volunteered to provide oral medical evidence to illustrate the true nature of his situation and his commitment to his mother and his brother.  By caring for his mother and his brother in this manner, my constituent is saving the State a great deal of money.  It is mean and penny-pinching that he should be denied the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">I earnestly urge the Minister to have this case re-examined and referred for a further oral hearing in order that justice might be done in this most deserving case.  I would appreciate if the necessary arrangements could be made for the oral hearing to be held.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_862">
            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1673">I thank Deputy O'Mahony for sharing time.  I am glad to be able to support his call in respect of this matter, which I raised on the Adjournment some time ago.  I compliment the Minister on coming before the House to reply to this matter.  That is a dying practice among her colleagues nowadays.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">As a caring person, the Minister will be more aware than others of what is involved where a person is obliged to care for his 83-year-old mother and another relative who is suffering from cancer.  I would not have found it extraordinary if there had been a disqualification in respect of one of the patients in this case.  It is amazing, however, that both patients were disqualified, one on the grounds of not being in need of care — even though she is 83 years of age — and the other on the grounds that the carer was not entirely occupied.  The fact is that the carer could not leave the family home.  He was obliged to spend all of his time there caring for his mother and brother.  If the man in question were working outside the home — which he could do — the carees would have to be placed in institutional care, which would result in a cost on the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">I urge the Minister to order a further oral hearing to ensure that the case is fully and properly heard.  My comments are not a reflection on those responsible for hearing the case on the previous occasion.  Rather they are designed to give the appellant an opportunity to state the case again, notwithstanding the fact that the decisions have already been made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1676">I thank both Deputies for raising this issue.  Eligibility for respite care grant was originally confined to people in receipt of certain primary social welfare payments, who received it automatically.  Such people continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">In the 2005 budget, eligibility for the respite care grant was extended to include all carers irrespective of means or contribution record but subject to certain statutory conditions.  The main conditions for receipt of respite care grant are that the person or persons in respect of whom the application is made must require full-time care and attention and that the applicant must be providing such care and attention.  The legislation provides that a person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where they require continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or to avoid danger to themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The person to whom the Deputies refer submitted an application for a respite care grant on 25 July 2007 in respect of his mother and brother.  With regard to the applicant's brother, the deciding officer refused the application as the application form indicated that the care being given was in the nature of help around the house and farm, which does not constitute the kind of care and attention envisaged by the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">With regard to the applicant's mother, the application was refused on the grounds that her condition is not such that she requires the level of care envisaged by the legislation.  The deciding officer based this decision on the advice of the Department's medical assessors, who reviewed all the medical evidence submitted by her general practitioner.  Also, with regard to the applicant's mother, the deciding officer was not satisfied that the level of care he was providing was consistent with that envisaged in the respite care grant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The above decisions were appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  The appeals officer, who is independent in coming to a decision, examined all the evidence submitted, including that produced at an oral hearing, and upheld the decision of the deciding officer.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and conclusive under the legislation and may only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence not already presented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">As we are now into the new year of 2008, the respite care grant scheme runs into this year.  Deputy O'Mahony stated the applicant had not given the full picture on the original application.  I suggest the applicant should make a new application under the 2008 respite care grant scheme for this year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_1683">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the closing date of 15 May for applications to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for benefit under the single farm payment scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, REPS, the energy crop scheme and protein crop scheme.  This might well be one of the shortest contributions on an Adjournment debate but it will probably be one of the more important this year with regard to the agricultural community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">I have in my possession documentation from the Department, SPS document 08.  The official Department document states, "Please note the closing date for submission of 2008 applications and supporting documentation is 31 May 2008."  I will give that personally to the Minister, whom I am delighted to see in the Chamber.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">The reason I raise this matter is that the value of single farm payments, as a result of their defined nature, is declining year on year in real terms.  We have now seen modulation proposals from the CAP reform.  It is simply unacceptable for any farmer to lose a percentage of his payment by virtue of submitting a late application.  The Minister knows as well as I and any representative of a rural constituency the pressure under which Teagasc offices and independent agricultural consultants worked over the past weeks when trying to get the maximum number of applications in by 15 May.  Significant effort was made.  I am sure the Minister will tell me tonight that of possibly 130,000 applications, the vast majority have been submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">There was conflicting advice on official Department documentation, as well as an almost impossible deadline for agriculture consultants, Teagasc and otherwise, to meet — 15 May.  I reiterate that the conflicting documentation states clearly, "Please note the closing date for submission of 2008 applications and supporting documentation is 31 May 2008."</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">I ask the Minister to address this in the interests of farmers and to ensure nobody suffers an undue penalty.  There is a 1% penalty per day on late application up to the end of May.  In order to ensure nobody suffers an undue penalty and loss of income in difficult times, given the small number of applications concerned, I ask the Minister to accept that all applications received in the Department after 15 May and up to the end of this month should be documented and approved for full payment without penalty.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_866">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1688">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I am happy to assure the House that the procedures operated by my Department during the application period for the submission of the 2008 single farm payment forms worked extremely well.  In all, over 99.5% of all applications were submitted on time by farmers either by post, the Department's electronic on-line system or by delivering them to one of the Department's local offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">The Deputy will be aware that for a number of years, my Department has adopted the practice of pre-printing data on the personalised applications automatically provided to scheme applicants in order to simplify the application process for farmers.  The huge benefit of this service is that those applicants whose farming circumstances do not change from one year to the next simply have to check the pre-printed data and, being satisfied as to its accuracy, sign and submit the form to my Department.  It should be noted that in excess of two thirds of applications each year fall into this "no change" category.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">My Department is constantly looking for ways to improve the system of submission of applications forms by farmers.  An on-line application facility for the single payment scheme was introduced on a pilot basis for the 2007 scheme, which was very well received by farmers.  While the number received on-line under the 2007 scheme was a very respectable 7,500, I am very pleased to inform the House that the number submitted on-line under the 2008 scheme has risen to 19,500 — almost a threefold increase.  This increase, which is very welcome, is evidence of the benefits which farmers and their advisers see in the on-line facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">When choosing a closing date for the 2008 scheme, my Department had to be very mindful of the fact that, for the first time, applicants under the rural environment protection scheme had to observe the SPS closing date.  Applicants under a variety of other schemes, including the disadvantaged areas scheme, the energy crops scheme, the farm waste management scheme and the new suckler welfare scheme, among many others, are also obliged to submit single payment applications.  Therefore, it was decided to set the closing date at the latest allowed under the EU rules.  Under the relevant EU regulations, there is no possibility of extending this deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">Specifically with regard to the closing date under the 2008 scheme, the following additional measures were taken by my Department to ensure that the message regarding the closing date received the widest possible publicity.  In addition to the press release of 2 May reminding farmers of the upcoming deadline and advising them to submit their forms if they had not already done so, emphasising that there was no possibility of an extension, and the placing of an advertisement in the farming press setting out a similar message, my Department took the following action on the matter.  A note highlighting the closing date was e-mailed to all local radio stations with a request that they publicise the deadline in their agricultural programmes and their community notices.  An information note was issued to all agriculture agents by e-mail.  The Department also made contact with the management of An Post and asked them to ensure that all post addressed to the single payment unit in Portlaoise was delivered promptly last week.  A further press release was issued on 12 May.  We also worked with the farming press with a view to publishing articles highlighting the need to submit an application by 15 May 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">In addition, I decided to keep all 47 Department local offices open until 9 p.m. on Thursday, 15 May, while the main single payment scheme office in Portlaoise remained open through lunchtime to facilitate callers.  The <i>Agfood.ie</i> helpdesk, which deals exclusively with on-line issues from farmers and agents, remained open until 12 midnight on the closing day, an out-of-hours service having also been available in the days prior to the closing date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">I am fully satisfied that the campaign initiated by my Department was entirely successful, as is clearly illustrated by the high level of applications submitted by farmers by the deadline of 15 May 2008.  While, as in all walks of life, some applications were submitted after the deadline, it is interesting to note that the numbers received late in 2008 are broadly in line with the numbers received late — approximately 0.5% — under the 2007 scheme and earlier years.  The vast majority of these will be subject only to a 1% late reduction penalty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">If Deputy Creed gives me the documentation referred to earlier I will have the matter investigated.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_1696">I thank the Minister for being here to respond.  My matter relates to fisheries in the Cromane Bay, particularly Castlemaine Harbour.  On Tuesday of last week, the draft netsmen had a licence to go fishing.  At 5 p.m. on Monday of last week, they received notification that they could proceed to fish.  However, the South Western Regional Fisheries Board received an e-mail from the Minister at 8 p.m. on that day, announcing that he intended to introduce a by-law to stop them from fishing.  When I raised this matter last week with the Taoiseach, who has said he wants to get business done in a proper fashion, I asked him whether this was an example of the best way to do business.  The netsmen thought they would be able to go fishing on Tuesday, but by Wednesday morning a by-law had been introduced to prevent them doing so.  The Taoiseach said he understood that the Minister had introduced the by-law on the basis of scientific information.  I have the information in question in front of me.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Minister has made this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">The three rivers in question are the Caragh, the Laune and the Maine.  I accept that there is a problem with salmon stocks on the River Maine.  I have seen a map, which forms part of the scientific evidence on the basis of which the Minister made his decision.  A line on the map represents an avenue used by salmon to get to the River Maine.  In no way does it represent an interference with the journey of the salmon to the River Maine.  Last year's surplus for the River Caragh was 1,121.  The conservation limit was 531.  One does not have to be great at mathematics to realise there was a surplus of approximately 600.  The surplus on the River Laune last year was 7,265 salmon.  There is a draft net quota for 6,166 salmon.  However, the Minister will not allow the draft men to fish.  I am in favour of the anglers being able to catch salmon with their tags, etc.  I believe they can live in harmony given that there was a surplus last year of 7,265 and a draft net quota of 6,166.  It must be admitted that those figures emerged as a consequence of the abolition of drift net fishing.  When one has a conservation limit, and there is a quota of 7,265 above that, those salmon can be caught by private licence holders but not by commercial licence holders.  I cannot understand why such discrimination exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">I have a big problem with one of the people advising the Minister.  The person in question, who is on the Central Fisheries Board, went to the High Court recently to claim that he owns the River Caragh.  He lost the case.  He is one of the many people on the Central Fisheries Board who is advising the Minister.  He has a conflict of interest, which is not right or proper.  It is not the proper fashion in which to do business, as the Taoiseach might say.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">The Laune and Caragh rivers have had a surplus since 2006 and 2007, respectively, as a consequence of the abolition of drift netting.  I believe that angling and draft fishing can live in harmony.  I ask the Minister to rescind his by-law.  I understand that the matter is to be raised in the High Court next Friday.  I do not think it should go that far.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_868">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1700">Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of inland fisheries stocks rests with the Central Fisheries Board and the relevant regional fisheries boards.  I remind Deputy Sheahan that the South Western Regional Fisheries Board — not the Central Fisheries Board — is responsible for the fisheries in the Cork and Kerry fishery districts.  The Kerry district includes Cromane Bay, which was referred to by the Deputy.  I assume he was speaking about the location where the sea comes into Castlemaine Harbour at Dingle Bay, County Kerry.  My function in the management of wild salmon fishery is to introduce the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations that specify, <i>inter alia</i>, which rivers have a harvestable surplus according to the management and scientific advice.  I have signed an array of salmon conservation by-laws determining the conditions under which wild salmon can be harvested during the season.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">On 23 April 2008, the South Western Regional Fisheries Board circulated proposals on how it intended to manage the Kerry fishery district in 2008.  It was indicated that the fishery in Castlemaine Harbour should be opened on a restricted basis, with special conditions that included an obligation on fishermen to provide scale samples of all fish caught for analysis to determine the river stock to which they belong.  Since 2006, the Government's policy has been to adhere to the scientific advice and to manage for conservation rather than for catch.  In that context, when I received the board's proposals, I sought the advice of the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission.  The scientific advice I received, generally speaking, is that the harvest of fish should be contained to estuaries and rivers which are meeting their conservation limits.  In the case of bays into which two or more rivers flow, the standing scientific committee, in specifying the available surplus for harvest, requires that all rivers meet their conservation limits.  If it is the case that harvest is going to take place on the mixed stock, an appropriate reduction of the available surplus is made.  The Maine and Behy rivers, two of the rivers that flow into Castlemaine Harbour, are not meeting their conservation limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">I am mindful of the advice of the standing scientific committee that mixed stock fisheries pose a particular threat to the attainment of conservation limits in all rivers.  In this regard, a fishery operating in Castlemaine Harbour outside of the river estuaries must be considered a mixed stock fishery as it is potentially exploiting fish from each of the rivers which flow into the harbour.  I advised the board that I did not regard the arrangements, which were identified as being in accordance with the Government decision on the management of the fishery, to be in compliance with the scientific advice.  The prosecution of a fishery in the common estuary of Castlemaine Harbour is not provided for in schedule 4 of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations.  In interpreting the regulations, it is my view that the precautionary principle must be adhered to.  Therefore, no harvest of fish should compromise stocks which are identified as failing to meet conservation limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">It is vital to afford every protection to the remaining salmon stocks and to clearly prioritise conservation over catch.  We must fulfil our obligation under the habitats directive to maintain or restore fish stocks to favourable conservation status.  To add further legal clarity to the matter, I introduced by-law No. 832 of 2008 which prohibits the taking of salmon and trout by all means, including draft net, rod and line, in the waters of Castlemaine Harbour, the common estuary of the Behy, Caragh, Laune and Maine rivers, between Inch and Rosbehy points.  Any delay in restoring the commercial fishery can only assist in the recovery of those stocks which are not meeting their conservation limits, thereby providing the opportunity for a sustainable fishery in the future.  I have asked the South Western Regional Fisheries Board to ensure that appropriate surveys are repeated to the satisfaction of the scientists to establish with certainty the status of stocks in the Behy and Maine rivers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1705">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the European Commission's Study on Benchmarking Access and Use of ICT in European Schools, which was published following two surveys carried out in Spring 2006.  The study found that 66% of Irish schools had broadband internet connections as compared with 67% of European schools generally, which ranked Ireland at number 20 of the 27 countries surveyed.  The surveys underpinning this Report were undertaken during the roll-out of the Schools Broadband Access Programme and I understand that at the time of survey in March/April 2006,  the percentage of schools connected under the Programme would have been in the mid 80s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1706">As the Deputy will be aware my Department is providing broadband connectivity to primary and post-primary schools under the Schools Broadband Access Programme.  This programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government — IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.  The Programme comprises three elements — local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools and is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">Following a competitive, technology neutral, central procurement process for the provision of local connectivity for schools in 2004, roll-out of broadband to schools commenced in June 2005.  The total number of schools involved in the Programme has been adjusted in the meantime to reflect a number of school openings, closures and amalgamations and stands currently at 3,936.  As of 24th April, 2008, 3,907 schools (99%) have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,904 have had their router capability installed and tested.  A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes.  Having regard to the almost universal availability of broadband connectivity in our schools as a consequence of the Schools Broadband Access Programme, I am confident that our relative performance internationally has improved significantly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1709">In 2005, 2006 and 2007, legal formalities were completed by my Department  for the acquisition of 36 sites for primary schools at a cost in excess of €66m. I am arranging to have a tabular statement prepared in respect of all of the sites in question outlining the position relating to planning and construction on these and I will forward this information to the Deputy immediately. However, due to commercial sensitivity, it will not be possible to provide costs associated with specific sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">It is expected that the acquisition of sites will continue to accelerate in the coming years as a result of the increasing need for school accommodation arising from demographic trends. The cost of any site is determined both by the amount of land required to accommodate the size of the school together with the value of land pertaining in the actual location of the proposed school. My Department seeks to purchase sites ranging from 2.5 to four acres in size, depending on the size of the primary school to be built. Typically, a new eight classroom primary school would generally be designed with a site area of 2.5 acres and a site of approximately 3 acres for a new sixteen classroom school. Larger schools would require four acres.  These size guidelines are advisory and relate solely to the provision of new school buildings. Smaller sites are often considered — in particular, for urban areas where sites of this size are not always available and/or where the cost per acre is prohibitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">Design Teams for school building projects work closely with the relevant local authorities to ensure that sites are developed in a manner compatible with local authority planning requirements. To meet the anticipated need for sites, my Department has also been developing in partnership with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the City and County Managers Association a code of practice for planning authorities on the provision of schools in the planning system. It is intended that these guidelines will be issued in the coming weeks and should assist in the timely procurement of sites required for schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1713">My Department has to date entered into three separate contracts to design, build, finance, maintain and operate educational accommodation under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. There are two third level projects, the National Maritime College, Cork and the Cork School of Music as well as the Pilot PPP Schools which are located in Tubbercurry, Shannon, Ballincollig, Dunmanway and Clones.  All three contracts are for 25 years. The buildings will remain in State ownership for the duration of the contract with the PPP Company being granted a licence to build the facilities and maintain and operate them for a period of 25 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">Provision has been made in the 2008 estimates for expenditure of €32.4m on PPP projects with €28.4m of current funding being provided to cover the on-going payments in respect of all three projects and the balance of €4m (capital) provided to advance further PPP projects.  The €28.4 m is divided further into a Second Level estimate of €10.8 million and a Third Level estimate of €17.6m. The interest rate for each project is fixed when the contract is concluded. During the bidding process, the risk of interest rate movement is retained by the public sector and is transferred to the private sector after the contract has been agreed. The rate is fixed by reference to the prevailing European Central Bank rate at the time the contract is concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">The interest rate on the debt for the three projects were set as follows.  For the Pilot Schools, the contract provides that the interest rate increases by 0.15% over the 25 years giving an average fixed interest rate of 6.196%.  For the National Maritime College, the interest rate deceases by 0.59% over the 25 years giving an average fixed interest rate of 5.563%.  For the Cork School of Music, the interest rate increases by 0.1% over the 25 years giving an average fixed interest rate of 4.552%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">For a PPP tender to demonstrate better value for money, the additional cost of private finance must either be justified by risks transferred to the private sector or offset in some other way by innovative proposals to address the Department's requirements. The faster delivery of the building could also be taken into account in this respect. The Public Sector Benchmark provides a key measure for the Department to test the extent to which the bids are good value for the State.  The principal funding for each of these projects has been provided by Barclays Bank in the case of the Pilot Schools and the Cork School of Music and by the Bank of Scotland and the European Investment Bank in the case of the National Maritime College.  The annual facilities management charges for 2008, excluding construction and maintenance, in respect of each of the current projects are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">Pilot Schools €94,925</p>

            <p eId="para_1720">The above charges are exclusive of VAT @ 21% and are index linked and reviewed with reference to the Consumer Price Index in the third quarter of each year.  The €4 million capital provided in the estimates for 2008 will be used to progress the current Second and third Level Programme which consists of 27 schools and 9 Third Level Institutions.</p>

          the reason the extensive reforms in the leaving certificate examinations due to come into effect in 2009 have been put on hold without a date communicated to the working group involved in the oral examinations; the cost of the changes proposed; the extent of the deterioration in the national finances which has caused this change of policy to be abruptly introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1722">It is assumed that this question relates to the timing of the oral examinations within the existing language subjects rather than the senior cycle curricular reforms.  Discussions within a working group comprised of the partners in education have been held to explore other models of delivery of the oral examinations, in the context of concerns about maintaining the integrity of the school year and of the examinations process. Following analysis of a number of possibilities significant progress was made towards identifying a viable alternative model, with some work remaining. The model involved would require significant additional expenditure, and it is not certain that it would find sufficient acceptance to result in an  improved supply of examiners vis a vis the current model.  At this stage, my Department is not in a position to approve proposals for new measures for 2009 unless they can be exchequer neutral, and such an approach is not possible in this case.   Accordingly it is not possible at present to finalise the proposals for presentation to the partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">This is not an abrupt change in policy, nor was any agreement reached on the matter. The issue will be kept under continuing review so that the discussions on a viable alternative model can be progressed at the earliest opportunity. I can inform the Deputy that a revised schedule for the 2008 June Leaving Certificate examinations has been agreed with the Partners in Education which is designed to be more student friendly, and reduce the demand on students especially during the first week of the examinations. By moving forward some of the subjects that are taken by fewer students, the revised schedule will result in most students getting at least one half day, and possibly two, in the first week of the schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">In addition, a programme of curriculum reform is continuing, for  which the NCCA is undertaking extensive development work with schools. New syllabi in Leaving Certificate Technology and Design and Graphic Communications have been introduced in September 2007 for first examination in 2009, significant reforms are under way in Maths and Irish, and proposals are expected from the Council shortly in regard to senior cycle Science.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">The stages of architectural planning referred to by the Deputy arise from my Department's design team procedures for the procurement of major capital projects. These are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender. They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.  At present, there are nine stages involved in the delivery of major school projects under my Department's design and building processes. These fall into 3 main phases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Stages 1 to 3: Design Team is appointed, site options are identified and the optimum design developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">At present, there are 245 primary schools at the following stages of architectural planning:</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">94 projects are at stages 1 to 3</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">51 projects are at Stages 4 to 5</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">My Department has been using generic repeat design buildings, wherever possible, to achieve a substantial savings in terms of design team fees as well as reducing the time taken to bring projects to completion.

It is envisaged that the conference will accommodate approximately 200 invited delegates.  These will include representatives of the main patron bodies, management bodies, the wider primary education partners and other interested parties.  I can confirm that it is also my intention to invite each of the Opposition Education spokespersons to attend.  The conference will be open to members of the media.  I am currently working with my officials to finalise the detailed practical arrangements for the day, including the detail of speakers and attendance.  These arrangements are at an advanced stage and the details will be made public as soon as all the relevant speakers and panellists have been confirmed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The format for the day will aim to encourage a high degree of dialogue and interaction on the important issues under consideration.  As the Deputy is aware, the conference will consider the implications of new societal diversity on the future organisation of primary schools.  The conference will provide an opportunity for each of the main patron bodies to outline their vision of how the system needs to collectively evolve to respond to the changing circumstances.  Discussions will focus on the particular challenges of ethos and inclusion for patron bodies, under the existing patronage models as well as under the new patronage model to be piloted in September 2008.  The long term challenges of organising and developing our system of school governance to accommodate new parental demands and aspirations will be subject to consideration.  The Conference will deal with a range of associated issues such as the challenges of capacity constraints, the provision of choice for parents, ensuring whole community inclusion in our schools as well as the implications of societal change on enrolment policies and approaches to the teaching of religion in multi-faith environments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">Following opening key-note speeches to establish the context for the discussion, each of the main patron bodies will be invited to present their perspectives on the evolving governance challenge.  This will be followed by structured open forum discussion and debate around the relevant issues, involving the speakers from the main patron bodies, an extended panel of participants and the wider audience. This discussion will be led by an independent chair.  I am personally looking forward to what will be a very valuable opportunity for engaging with all of the relevant stakeholders on the very important issues at stake for the future of our primary education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1741">The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government. The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.  Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children. This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.  Similarly the commitment in relation to improving class size in second level schools can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing  priorities for available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1745">The purpose of the C4 provision in the Estimates is to meet the costs of salary, employer's PRSI contributions, substitution and pensions for Special Needs Assistants in primary schools. The costs of salary, employers contributions and pension costs of the caretakers and clerical officers employed in primary schools under a scheme introduced in 1978 are also met from the sub-head.  Special needs assistants employed in primary and second level schools and paid fortnightly and have a common incremental pay scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Special needs assistants are awarded the general pay increases but are subject to adherence to the terms of the various agreements.  In the case of the recent 2.5% increase from the 1st March, 2008, it was necessary to obtain verification of co-operation of the SNA grade with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of the matters covered by the Towards 2016 agreement.  Clerical Officers and caretakers employed under the 1978 scheme are paid fortnightly.  The pay scales are approved by the Department, with the sanction of the Department of Finance, and attract national pay awards.  There are incremental scales for these caretakers and clerical officers.  Both the clerical officers and caretakers are awarded general pay increases but are also subject to the terms of the agreements that I referred for the special needs assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Discussions on terms and conditions of service for special needs assistants are held with the relevant unions on an ongoing basis. The managerial bodies of schools also participate in these discussions.   Agreements exist for special needs assistants in relation to contracts of employment, pension scheme, hours of work, length of working year, school holidays, seniority in school and redundancy terms.  There were 8,241 special need assistant equivalents employed in primary schools in March 2008.  198 Clerical Officers and Caretakers respectively were employed under the 1978 scheme and paid on the payroll in March  2008 in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The 1978 scheme was replaced by the ancillary services grant scheme.  Under this grant scheme, the amount paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs.  The C4 sub-head does not cover the cost of secretaries and caretakers employed by schools under the ancillary grant scheme.</p>

An application for recognition, from September 2008, of the new school to which the Deputy refers was received by the New Schools Advisory Committee.   As the proposed school was deemed to meet the general criteria for new primary schools, the Committee recommended that it be granted provisional recognition from September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">In granting provisional recognition to a new school, cognisance needs to be given to the potential future commitment of capital resources that is likely to arise.   My Department must ensure efficiency and equity in the allocation of limited resources.  In that context, and given the significant additional levels of primary school provision made in the area in question in the past 3 years, my predecessor was satisfied that sufficient provision has been made to serve the current and future population in the short to medium term and that appropriate diversity of provision has been provided. On that basis, provisional recognition has not been granted to the proposed new school at this time. This does not preclude recognition at a future date. The Patron has been informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">With regard the new pilot community primary school, this school was established in 2007 under the provisional patronage of the Catholic Church to meet educational needs of the Diswellstown/Porterstown area.

From September 2008, this school will come under the patronage of the VEC under the new pilot primary school model and will be relocated to a site on the Porterstown Road to continue to serve the Diswellstown/Porterstown area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1759">The New Schools Advisory Committee (NSAC) was established in 2002 on foot of recommendations of the Commission on School Accommodation on a non-statutory basis.  The Committee is charged with making recommendations to me in relation to applications received for new Primary schools using a set of published criteria.  Under Section 10 of the Education Act, 1998 as Minister I am empowered to recognise schools for the purposes of the Act. The vast majority of NSAC recommendations are accepted; however, there have been five occasions where NSAC recommendations were not followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">In 2007, the NSAC was unable to look favourably on two applications received due to inadequate enrolment information provided by the proposers.  However, in view of the population growth in the locations to be served by the proposed schools it was decided to grant recognition. In 2008, the NSAC was unable to look favourably on one application received due to inadequate enrolment information provided by the proposer.  Again based on population growth in the proposed area this school was recognised and is expected to open in September.  While the NSAC looked favourably on two separate applications, one application was not granted recognition pending the outcome of an assessment of the proposed patron body by my Department, while the second application was not granted recognition at this time, given the significant additional levels of primary school provision made in the area in the past 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">Since 2002 the Committee has considered applications and made reports and recommendations on six occasions.  I have instructed my officials to provide the details requested by the Deputy in relation to the recommendations made by the NSAC to my Department.</p>

My Department is aware also that the Christian Brothers kept the relevant stakeholders, such as the management and teaching personnel of the schools concerned, informed of the progress they were making. At the core of the establishment of Trust Boards, including the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, is an intent and desire to secure the future of the ethos of these schools at a time when the role of members of the orders in day to day management will be greatly diminished as a result of falling numbers of religious.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1770">I am aware of the funding pressures on schools generally and also of the recent submission on this matter by the Primary Management Bodies to the Joint Committee on Education and Science. It is a key priority for Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools to help address these funding pressures. Specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to improving school funding are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment.   The Government will continue to prioritise further improvements on school funding for 2009 and onwards and this approach is the best way of sustaining the substantial improvements into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil. As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.  The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 from 1st January, 2008. This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.  Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion. In the current school year, DEIS related grants totalling almost €19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  In summary, I agree that further increases are necessary and increasing the capitation for primary schools will be a key priority. I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.</p>

          further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 62 and 63 of 13 November 2007, when the Special Education Appeals Board will be operational; if he has concluded developing proposals for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004; when he expects the Act to be implemented in full; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_884">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1775">As the Deputy will be aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs. Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.  The Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established in April 2007, under section 36 of the EPSEN Act 2004, to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act. The Board comprises a Chairperson and two ordinary members, each of whom have a special interest in, or knowledge of, education and in particular the education of persons with special educational needs. The Board is continuing to identify the resources and processes it will need to put in place to ensure that it will be ready to fulfil its role once the relevant sections of the Act are commenced.  As part of the associated extensive research process the board is being supported by a research consultancy group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">When the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 was enacted it was recognised that implementation would require a considerable change agenda, in order to further develop and support inclusive schools as the cornerstone of special education needs provision. The National Council for Special Education was required under the Act to make a report on the implementation of the Act. Following consideration of the issues raised in the Council's implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, it is envisaged that the five year timeframe to 2010 acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">My Department is now at an advanced stage in finalising proposals on this basis to facilitate implementation of the remaining sections, including the provisions in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEP). The time taken to finalise proposals reflects the complexities involved, the need for consultation across the wide range of people and sectors involved, the need to align with the requirements of the Disability Act, 2005 and define how the Health Service Executive (HSE) and NCSE will work together under both acts.  A Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the NCSE and the HSE, is currently developing operational protocols to outline how the two sectors will interact in accordance with the legislative framework. All parties are approaching this work with a view to determining how the assessment of need and education/health planning process can be aligned in the best interests of people with disabilities and their families. It is envisaged that these protocols will be finalised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced. My Department's priority, therefore, is to ensure that the necessary training, guidance and supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. In parallel with these processes, my Department has also advanced a number of areas relevant to the implementation of EPSEN:</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">Proposals for pre-school services developed</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">Establishment of the Standards Body</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">Recruitment of additional staff for the Council and staffing review of the NCSE</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">Appointment of Chairperson and members to the Special Education Appeals Board</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Recruitment of educational psychologists</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Review of the scheme for commissioning private assessments</p>

            <p eId="para_1786">Contributing to assessments under the Disability Act</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">It must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs across the schools network through the work of the National Council for Special Education.</p>

            <p eId="para_1789">In accordance with the Programme for Government, my Department has established a Developing Areas Unit to identify areas of rapid population growth, assess the educational needs in these areas and plan solutions for the accommodation needs identified. As part of a fast-track programme of construction for September 2008, my Department is building five 16-classroom primary schools, 25 eight-classroom primary schools and a number of smaller projects in those areas where school accommodation is under greatest pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">To deliver its 2008 programme, the Developing Areas Unit has been working closely with relevant Local Authorities on the acquisition of sites and on general pre-planning issues. Project Managers, together with architectural, engineering and quantity surveying services were recruited from the private sector in October 2007 to prepare the planning applications, undertake the necessary surveys and oversee the delivery of the schools on each site. Sites for each of the projects have been identified and site master-plans have been developed by the technical teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">An EU tendering process to establish a drawdown contract for the off-site construction of permanent and temporary accommodation has been completed. The successful tenders for the construction of each individual project have been notified and at this stage, construction of a number of the schools has already commenced. The programme for the delivery of these projects is broadly on target, however, the time-frames are very challenging and risks to the timely delivery of these new schools still exist and are being managed by the Developing Areas Unit.  When taken with a number of other projects in developing areas involving extensions to existing schools, approximately 7,500 additional school places will be provided for September2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">In the meantime, my Department is identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be needed for 2009 and onwards. This is also being done in close consultation with local authorities.  My Department is satisfied that the approach which it is now taking to the identification and delivery of extra school places in rapidly developing areas will ensure that those places will be provided when and where they are needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1794">Under the terms of my Department's Free Fees Initiative the exchequer meets the tuition fees of full-time eligible undergraduate students. Third level Institutions have a Student Services Charge which is levied by the institutions to defray the costs of normal examinations, registration and student services.   This charge does not cover the costs associated with the setting, administering and correcting of repeat examinations offered by institutions as a second chance option for students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">All students who are eligible for a means tested student support grant have the Student Services Charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant to which they are entitled.   The position is that the third level institutions are autonomous institutions and my Department does not have any function in their day to day operational affairs, for which the Governing Bodies and the management staff of the institutions are responsible.   Accordingly I do not have a role in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">However as the Deputy may be aware there is a Student Assistance Fund (SAF) available in the third level institutions. The objective of the SAF is to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, because of financial reasons, suffer severe hardship or be unable to continue their third level studies. Applications for funding should be made by the individual student to the Access Officer in their institution. The SAF is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1798">Under the terms of my Departments Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees of eligible students, including those from Northern Ireland and other EU Member States, who are attending approved third-level courses in the State. The main conditions are that students must be first-time undergraduates and hold E.U. nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an E.U. Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  There are no plans to extend this initiative to cover third-level institutions in Northern Ireland.  However Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in both EU and in non-EU member states.</p>

            <p eId="para_1810">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. If an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>

            <p eId="para_1813">The Erasmus Programme, which emphasises student and staff mobility and European co-operation involving higher education institutions and other key players in the knowledge-based economy, is a key part of the European Commission-funded Lifelong Learning Programme 2007-2013. The Commission's regulations for the Erasmus Programme specify that a Government Ministry must act as the National Authority, which is responsible for the monitoring, supervision and funding of the operations of the National Agency, which administers the programme.  My Department acts as the National Authority for the Erasmus Programme in Ireland and programme is administered by the Higher Education Authority, as the National Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">The provisional number of outgoing participating students from Ireland in 2007/2008 is 1,525 for Erasmus study, which involved study in a partner institution in Europe, and 344 for Erasmus placements, which is a work placement programme for higher education students, making a total of 1,869.  The number of participating students across the European Union for 2007/208 will not be available until the spring of 2009.

            <p eId="para_1817">Agreement has been reached between the trustees of the three existing post-primary schools in Skibbereen to amalgamate into a single school. The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works was requested to source a site for the development of a single school. A number of sites were identified and examined. Those considered potentially suitable for the provision of a school building for the amalgamation were then discussed with Cork County Council.  Following that exercise and to date, no site has been identified that is suitable from the perspectives of my Department, the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">Because of the difficulty in sourcing a green field site the Department decided to investigate the possibility of utilising the Rossa College site to facilitate the proposed building project. To this end a feasibility study of the site and building was commissioned in order to determine how best to provide for the long-term accommodation needs of the proposed school. However, because of the opposition from the Trustees of the proposed new Community School to the Rossa College site, this option is no longer being pursued.

          the action he proposes to ensure that all primary and secondary schools provide places for children who have a learning disability or a special need, such as the children of immigrant families, and so avoid the emerging apartheid culture at present in the school system here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_896">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1820">The Deputy will be aware of this Government's commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes almost 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are also over 7,800 resource and learning support teachers — compared with about 2,000 in 1998. More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment.  Schools are therefore being supported to enable them to cater for children with special educational needs.  The provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs will continue to be a key Government priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">To meet the needs of migrant pupils for whom English is a second language, English Language Support Teachers have been appointed to primary and post-primary schools.  There are now just under 2,000 language support teachers in the schools at a cost of €120 million per annum. Schools with fewer than the 14 such pupils needed to qualify for one support teacher are provided with financial resources to assist them.  The National Council on Curriculum and Assessment has developed Intercultural Guidelines, one for primary schools and one for post-primary schools, to support teachers and schools in developing a more inclusive learning environment and in providing students with the knowledge and skills they need to participate in an intercultural world. There are also resources available specifically for English Language Support Teachers and other resources for the whole school team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">A number of research projects are also underway.  The Inspectorate is conducting an evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language (EAL) in a number of primary and post-primary schools in 2008 and 2009. A report will be prepared for mid 2009.  The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) is undertaking a large-scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning in primary and post-primary schools. It is expected that this review will be completed in autumn 2008.  The Department of Education and Science has agreed to become involved in the OECD thematic review of migrant education policy and practice at pre-school, primary and post-primary, which will be carried out by a team of OECD experts. It is expected that the OECD report will be completed by autumn 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The findings of this research work will evaluate current provision and will inform me on ways, where such are indicated, to improve the standard of English language education for migrant pupils in primary and post- primary schools.  The Deputy will be aware that it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">The Deputy may be aware that my Department recently published a report of a major audit of school enrolment practice. The purpose of the audit, conducted by my Department's Regional Office Service, was to examine the disparities that exist in schools in particular locations in relation to the numbers of pupils enrolled who are newcomers, have special educational needs or are from the Traveller community.  Over half the primary and second level schools in the country were surveyed under the audit.  I should emphasise that the statistical information presented requires cautious interpretation, particularly in the context of local factors that could be identified in many instances at primary level (e.g. a concentration of newcomer or traveller children living in a particular area impacting on enrolment in the nearest school).</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">When interpreted in that context, the statistical information returned does not point to enrolment problems on a system wide scale.  It does, however, identify a number of school clusters where the evidence points to some schools assuming more responsibility for enrolling children of all backgrounds and needs within their local community, than others.  In order to ensure that no schools are directly identified and to ensure that "league tables" for particular areas could not be formed, the published information excludes the names and addresses of schools, but groups them within geographical clusters for comparison purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">My predecessor has written to the main partners in education setting out some areas for consideration in order to facilitate an informed consultation with the education partners about possible policy measures available to ensure that all schools are welcoming and inclusive to all children of all needs in their own local community.   Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I will host a Conference on the Governance Challenge for Future School Needs on 27th June 2008 in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to consider the implications of new societal diversity on the future organisation of primary schools.  It will be an opportunity for each of the main patron bodies to outline their vision of how the system needs to collectively evolve to respond to the changing circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">The Conference will focus on the particular challenges of ethos and inclusion for patron bodies, under both the new and existing patronage models, in ensuring that the system is appropriately attuned to future demands.  The long term challenges of organising and developing our system of school governance to accommodate new parental demands and aspirations will be subject to consideration. The Conference will also deal with issues of capacity, choice, ensuring inclusion and the implications for enrolment policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1856">My Department spent €34.6m on the rental of temporary accommodation in primary schools in 2007.  This figure covers the rental of prefabricated classrooms as well as the rental of high quality buildings.  The duration of the rental contracts varies according to the need for such accommodation.  However, my Department has a policy that where such temporary accommodation is likely to be needed for more than three years, the prefabricated accommodation should be purchased rather than rented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">Demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided. However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible. Against this background, my Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low.  It should be noted that the amount spent on rental and purchased accommodation in 2007 was only 6.2% of the total investment in school buildings in 2007. This compares with 10.8% in 2003.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to a report delivered to the recent meeting in Galway of the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools which stated that secondary schools are required to independently raise up to €60 million a year and that 27% of the cost of day to day spending on heating and lighting has to be financed by voluntary contributions or other fund-raising measures due to the deficit in finance allocated to cover the costs of secondary school education; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1859">I can confirm that I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware secondary schools receive funding by way of per capita grants, to meet their day-to-day running costs, including heating and lighting.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools  have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">The total increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. The Deputy should be aware that these grants are in addition to the per capita funding, of up to €40,000 per school, that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. Accordingly, in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings the annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.  It is my intention to prioritise the commitments in the Programme for Government 2007-2012 relating to improved funding for our schools, for delivery over the lifetime of this Government, having regard to available resources.</p>

Despite its small size, Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world and accounts for 42% of total EU output.  In recent years up to 70% of the world's top stallions have been located in Ireland. This sector has been built from a cottage industry and I am satisfied that the tax exemption regime in force since 1969 has made an important contribution to its growth.  However, the Deputy may be interested to know that, as provided for in the 2006 and 2007 Finance Bills, the tax exemption will terminate with effect from 31 July this year.  I believe that the industry is mature enough and strong enough to continue to thrive in the future.</p>

It should be noted that registration on the NIDD is voluntary.  An integral part of the National Disability Strategy is the Multi-Annual Investment Programme, (MAIP), announced in the 2005 Budget, which provides €900m for the period 2006 to 2009. MAIP contains specific commitments in relation to the provision of specific high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009.  MAIP commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism in each of the years covered by the programme as well as the transfer of persons with intellectual disability/autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The Deputy's specific question in relation to the proposals and time-frame to move those individuals to more appropriate accommodation relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

            <p eId="para_2095">Section 10(c) of the Adoption Act, 1952, as amended by Section 2 of the 1964 Act provides that, in order to be eligible for adoption, a child must be "illegitimate or an orphan" or be a child who has been legitimated, but whose birth has not been re-registered.  The Adoption Act, 1988, does permit the adoption of any child (including children of marriage) but only in exceptional and very limited circumstances where the parents are shown to have completely abandoned their parental duties, and there is an expectation that they will continue to do so until the child reaches the age of eighteen.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">After its passage through the Oireachtas, the President referred the Adoption Bill, 1988 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on whether the provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution.  While it was found to be Constitutional, and subsequently became the Adoption Act, 1988, it was clear that these narrow circumstances, based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution, were the basis for the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children and included a provision to ensure that all children would be eligible for voluntary adoption, subject to appropriate consents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 and to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children [JCCAC] was established in November, 2007, to report back within four months, on the proposals set out in the Bill.  The Committee recently received Dáil and Seanad approval for an extension of their timeframe to 30th November 2008.  The Committee is now progressing with its work and the Government awaits the outcome of its deliberations before proceeding further with the proposed amendment of the Constitution in relation to children.</p>

          his views in respect of the growing crisis in Zimbabwe.  
        [20072/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_935">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2155">The Government is deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis in Zimbabwe. Since polling day on 29th March, the situation on the ground has deteriorated considerably. There are reports that at least 20 people have been killed, and over 28,000 displaced. State-sponsored beatings and torture meted out to opposition supporters and activists have reached appalling levels, and many of those who have been attacked have been prevented from accessing medical care, further exacerbating their injuries. The Government strongly condemns these vicious and inhuman acts. In this context, there are serious questions about whether a sufficiently secure environment can be achieved to allow a credible conclusion to the electoral process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">The long-delayed results of the presidential election of 29 March were finally released on 2 May. The Zimbabwean Electoral Commission figures give Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai 47.9% of the vote, and President Mugabe of ZANU-PF just over 43%. The MDC maintains that Mr. Tsvangirai took 50.3% of the vote, and there was certainly some evidence that ballots may have been tampered with during the unexplained 34-day gap between polling day and the announcement of results. However, it is clear even from the results announced that President Mugabe has lost the confidence of the people; and the people of Zimbabwe deserve the opportunity to make their choice between these two candidates in a free and fair run-off vote.   The Zimbabwean constitution specifies that a runoff election be held within 21 days, but it also allows postponement of the runoff if necessary in view of conditions on the ground. The Zimbabwean authorities have now indicated their intention to delay the run-off for ‘logistical reasons', and the second round of voting has been set for 27 June. During this period, President Mugabe will lead a care-taker administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">I take note of the fact that leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have urged the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that any second round of the Presidential election must take place in a secure environment. Ireland and the EU have also insisted that there is a need for conditions to improve, including in respect of media freedom and freedom of assembly, and for an end to the climate of violence and repression before any second round of voting. The EU is encouraging a regional response to the Zimbabwe situation by SADC's neighbours. Ireland will continue to press for an end to state-sponsored violence in Zimbabwe, and full respect for the democratically-expressed will of the people. Irish Ambassadors in the southern African region, and indeed throughout the continent, have raised our concerns with their host Governments, and will continue to do so as appropriate on an ongoing basis. We know that many of our African partners share our concern and outrage about what is happening in Zimbabwe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">We are also mindful of the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe, which has been exacerbated by disruptions caused by post-election violence. The EU and its member States remain the most important group of donors to Zimbabwe, and for our part, the Government is committed to continuing Irish Aid support to the Zimbabwean people. We, and all of the international community, must act with the best interests of the Zimbabwean people in mind, whether that means strong public pressure, or intensive efforts behind the scenes.  I intend to ensure that this issue is further discussed at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 May. Ireland will support any further action by the European Union to help create space for democracy in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <p eId="para_2162">The Irish government supports both the Colombian government and civil society groups in their efforts to support the peace process in Colombia.   In 2007, Irish Aid provided funding to the sum of €200,000 — the first of three equal yearly instalments — to Children in Crossfire, an NGO working to protect children's rights in Colombia and Brazil. In 2007, Irish Aid also provided €146,400 to Mercy Corps Scotland via Concern Universal for work to protect human rights in Colombia, and will maintain this level of funding in 2008 and 2009.  Irish Aid has also provided a total of €1,122,713 to date in 2008 to Trócaire and Christian Aid for projects in Colombia. Both Trócaire and Christian Aid work through local partners in Colombia. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided about €3.3 million to these organisations for their work in Colombia. Irish Aid also funds Irish Missionaries in Colombia via the Irish Missionary Resource Service. So far in 2008, the IMRS has allocated €41,500 to Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">In addition, Ireland is supporting regional efforts to support the peace process in Colombia. Irish Aid committed €390,000 to the Organisation of American States (OAS) Mission to Support the Peace Process (MAPP) in Colombia in three tranches starting in 2005. This mission has a broad mandate aimed at providing comprehensive support to the peace process, with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerning the rule of law.  The highest priority is attached to the human rights dimension of the OAS Mission's role. In this regard, Irish Aid provided €177,434 to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights between 2006 and 2007 for the independent monitoring of human rights issues in support of the OAS mission in Colombia. Irish Aid has also provided €50,000 in 2008 to the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for the OAS, who monitors and defends the right to freedom of expression in Colombia as well as other countries in the Americas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">In conjunction with our European Union partners, the Irish government will continue to examine how we may, as appropriate, contribute further to the peace process in Colombia. While, in discussions at EU level, it has not been considered that current conditions call for UN involvement in bringing peace to Colombia, Ireland would be supportive were the Colombian Government to request such intervention.</p>

These investments totalled €2.5m and which leveraged a further €4.7m. The targeted level of entrepreneurs or investors to be matched by the end of 2008 is 8. Total funding to date by Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland is €460k.</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">Sound management capability amongst enterprise leaders is of utmost importance in enabling them to adapt to modern business practices, to sustain their enterprises against competitive forces and to innovate for growth, expansion and exports.  In May 2007, as a follow-up to the recommendations in the Small Business Forum's Report, the Management Development Council was established, for a period of three years. The Council's objectives include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">To profile the adequacy and relevance of management development provision in Ireland;</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">To develop an Action Plan to close identified gaps in management 	development provision in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">To promote the development of a coordinated approach to building awareness and appreciation in the SME sector of the need to upgrade leadership and management skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">The Council has met on three occasions and has a number of projects currently underway. These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">A detailed census of all the Management Development Programmes, courses, schemes, services etc. available to SMEs;</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">A study to identify and understand the management development demands and needs of SMEs, and the barriers which inhibit SME participation in management development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">The Council will produce an Action Plan later this year.  It will contain practical   recommendations to my Department on supporting the development of world-class management skills within Irish SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">The Agencies under the aegis of my Department, particularly, FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards in addition to supporting the general development of small and medium enterprises also support direct management development initiatives.  Last year, FÁS through their One Step-Up Programme entered into a strategic alliance with six organisations to provide management development training to owners/managers of SMEs over the period 2007-2009. This training is being provided by Chambers Ireland, the IMI, Small Firms Association, ISME, National College of Ireland and Optimum Results. The cost of providing this training will be €10 million and it is expected that approximately 8,200 will avail of the training.  Since its inception Skillnets has placed a strong emphasis on stimulating demand amongst the SME community. The result of this has been that approximately 85% of all companies funded through the Training Networks Programme (TNP) and the Accel initiative have been SMEs with owner/managers forming approximately 10% of the total trainee cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">Enterprise Ireland delivers a number of management development programmes such as, the Leadership 4 Growth Programme for CEOs in the Software and Life Sciences sectors and the Enterprise Platform Programme, which is a one-year rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business.  The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. They also provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, mentoring initiatives and targeted promotion activities such as enterprise education and female entrepreneurship promotion activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2209">An tArd Chlaráitheoir (Registrar General) is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland. I have made enquiries with the Registrar General and he has informed me that the position is as follows.  Section 46 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, provides that the husband in a legally subsisting marriage shall be presumed to be the father of all children of the marriage, unless the contrary is proved on balance of probability. Statutory declarations and court orders set out as follows are required in order to set aside the presumption of paternity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">The provisions governing the registration of births are contained in Part 3 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004. Section 22(3) provides that, where the mother was married at the date of the birth of the child or at some time during the 10 months immediately before the birth, and where it is maintained that the legal spouse is not the father, the registrar must be given either a statutory declaration from the spouse rebutting paternity of the child, or a statutory of more than 10 months declaration of the mother that she has been living apart from the spouse during a period ending immediately before the date of the birth of the child by virtue of a decree of divorce, a decree of divorce a mensa et thoro, a decree of nullity or a deed of separation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">Sub-section 22(1)(<i>d</i>) provides for applications to register the father’s particulars the registrar is provided with a document purporting to be a copy of an order made by a court in proceedings referred to in section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987, and to be certified by or on behalf of the court to be a true copy of the order, finding that the person is the father of the child. The orders referred to are maintenance orders and orders relating to guardianship, for which applications may be made to local District Family Law Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">In the case that is the subject of the Deputy's question, the mother is still legally married and must provide to the registrar a statutory declaration from her estranged spouse rebutting paternity. Alternatively, a court order naming another man as the father of the child would be sufficient to rebut the presumption of paternity. While the mother is not obliged to register the particulars of the man named as the father in the court order, the mother or father, individually or jointly, would have the option to effect a re-registration to add the father's particulars at a later date.  Until such time as the presumption of paternity concerning the spouse is rebutted, either by way of statutory declaration or court order, it is not possible to effect registration in cases such as this without registering the legal spouse's details.</p>

            <p eId="para_2216">My Department has taken a lead role over the years in developing and implementing identity management policies and procedures based on the use of the Personal Public Services (PPS) number. This number was previously known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number. The name was changed to indicate the broadening of its role to one which supports delivery of a broader range of public services but it is also still used for its original core purpose of providing a common identifier for the Revenue Commissioners and this Department.  As well as facilitating wider-scale exchange of information, the PPS number also has a role in the development of on-line services for individuals. My Department provides identity related services to a number of agencies in accordance with legislation. Building on these services, the Department constructed Public Service Identity (PSI) services to assist agencies in basic on-line identity management. The initial deployment of PSI services supports the registration and authentication functions of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE on-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2217">The overall Government strategy is to realise the potential of the Information Society through innovation and modernisation of public services. As part of this, the Standard Authentication Framework Environment programme, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, builds on PSI Services to provide the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services. The Revenue Commissioners are also participating in this programme of work and we will continue to develop PSI and other relevant services in conjunction with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">My Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are currently engaged in finalising a renewed Memorandum of Understanding between our organisations concerning co-operation and mutual assistance. The objective of the proposed revised Memorandum is:</p>

            <p eId="para_2225">I am conscious of the need to facilitate persons in receipt of social welfare payments when taking up employment opportunities. To ensure that supports are structured to support this objective, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.  These include easing of means tests through income disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and the provision of employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">Some examples of disregards and the tapered approach are: the weekly cash disregard on one parent family payment (OPFP) and 50% assessment of the balance, with the earnings ceiling increased to €425 from 8 May 2008; payment of half rate OPFP for 6 months where earnings exceed €425; the earnings disregard which applies to people with disabilities when engaging in work of a rehabilitative nature, and the enhanced disregards of earnings introduced in 2007 in relation to the rent supplement scheme, which complement the rental accommodation scheme that was introduced in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">Significant progress in removing poverty and inactivity traps is also shown in two important reforms which were introduced as recently as September last.  These improved the method by which a person's earnings from employment, or the earnings of their partner, are assessed and facilitate persons in increasing their level of employment and income.  This means that both adults associated with a jobseeker's allowance claim are now assessed in a similar manner and ensures that the families gain when earnings increase, encouraging qualified adults to move beyond long-term part-time employment. These changes are designed in particular to be progressive for women, who currently make up the majority of qualified adults in the social welfare system.  Under the previous assessment procedures a trap existed whereby the loss in benefits to a household could exceed the gain in income attained by an increase in the earnings of a partner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">The changes also removed an anomaly in the assessment of means which discriminated against people with children, through the introduction of a daily earnings disregard of €20, benefiting many part-time workers, but particularly those with children.  For example, a couple earning €290 per week over three days with two children gained over €112 per week jobseekers allowance under the new arrangements.  In contrast, previous arrangements discouraged all but a small level of attachment to the workforce.  The new arrangements also apply to the disability allowance, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">The back to work (BTW) allowance scheme is part of the programme of initiatives designed to assist long term unemployed people, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force.  There are currently some 8,900 participants in the scheme of whom over 4,800 (54%) are engaged in self-employment. Participants also retain entitlement to certain secondary benefits.  In addition, the in-work income support provided through family income supplement (FIS) provides ongoing income support for people in low-income employment with children. There are in excess of 22,700 people in receipt of FIS, benefiting over 47,600 children (March 2008).</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">Notwithstanding these improvements, it should be appreciated that poverty traps can feature in any contingency-based system which features income thresholds.  However, the measures outlined, including those recently introduced, will have the effect of greatly reducing the incidence and extent of poverty traps and ensure that they will only arise at significantly higher income levels than previously applied.  My Department will continue to monitor the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives are removed.</p>

         the progress with the programme for Government commitment to ensure that women are treated fairly in the social welfare code and examine the proposals in the Green Paper on pensions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_952">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2232">The social welfare system has been improved over recent decades to make it easier for people, and women in particular, to qualify for contributory pensions.  Social insurance coverage has been extended to include new categories of employment such as part-time workers and qualifying conditions for pensions have been eased.  The home-makers scheme was introduced to limit the impact periods spent out of the workforce, on caring duties, on pension entitlements. The effect of these reforms, combined with increased workforce participation, will ensure that, in future, most people will qualify for a contributory pension in their own right.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">A qualified adult increase is payable in respect of a spouse or partner who is wholly or mainly maintained by a claimant. Since 2002, pensioner couples have been able to choose to have the qualified adult portion of the pension paid direct to the spouse or partner.  Many spouse partners without their own pension entitlement have received a direct payment in this way.  These arrangements were further enhanced from last September when direct payment of the qualified adult allowance was made mandatory in respect of all new pension claims.  Couples may opt to receive a single payment but only where the qualified adult indicates that she/he does not wish to receive a direct payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">The Government committed itself to complete the process, begun in Budget 2007, to bring payments to qualified adults up to the level of the state pension (non-contributory) over a period of three years. Budget 2008 included an increase of €27 per week in the rate of the qualified adult increase, bringing it to 94% of the state pension (non contributory).   The Programme for Government also includes a commitment to extend payment of the over 80 allowance to qualified adults, which will, when implemented, benefit some 4,500 people who are receiving support as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">There are, of course, some older women who, for various reasons, cannot benefit from the many changes already outlined.  Their position and that of others not covered by the social welfare pensions system is discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions which was published on 17 October 2007.  A consultation process on the Paper will conclude at the end of this month and work on developing the framework for future policy will commence with a view to completing the framework by the end of 2008.  The outcome of this process will inform pensions' policies to ensure they reflect the needs of women as well as men.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">The Department is also carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended).  The review will examine all the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.  The findings of this review will inform planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of all citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2238">The Programme for Government states that ‘The role and economic contribution of spouses working on the farm will be better recognised within the social insurance system, following on from Budget 2007 which allowed recipients of Farm Assist to make PRSI contributions for the first time'.  Spouses working for self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions. However, spouses who are actively engaged in a commercial partnership, including the operation of a farm, as opposed to simply being the joint owners of a property, are treated as individual self-employed contributors and are thus included under the social insurance systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">In the situation where a family business or farming enterprise is incorporated as a limited company, spouses involved in the business can establish a social insurance record as either employees or as self-employed contributors — depending on whether a contract of service exists. Also, a spouse engaged in "off-farm" employment, will pay social insurance contributions in his or her own right.  Under the provisions of the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, an information leaflet is currently being developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business. The leaflet will be published shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2246">I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures that scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.  The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  It has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">Increases to the carer's allowance income disregard, provided for in Budget 2008, mean that, from April 2008, a single person can have an income of €332.50 per week and a couple can have an income of up to €665 per week and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance (the previous levels were €320 and €640 per week respectively).  This ensures that a couple can have an income in the region of €37,200 per year and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package and the respite care grant.  This increase surpasses the "Towards 2016" commitment of ensuring that those on average earnings can qualify for carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">In addition, in Budget 2008 the maximum rate of carer's allowance was increased to €214 per week for those aged under 66 and to €232 per week for those aged over 66, with effect from January 2008.  Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance while receiving another social welfare payment, other than jobseekers benefit or allowance.  In June 2006 the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2250">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.    A carer who is caring for two or more people is entitled to a full grant for each of the care recipients.  The rate of the grant will increase to €1,700 per year from June 2008.  I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2253">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 30 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Improvements to the fuel allowance in recent years include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 30 weeks and an increase in the rates of payment. The current rate of fuel allowance is €18 with a supplement of €3.90 paid to recipients in designated smokeless areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">The extension of the national fuel scheme to eligible carers, as set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, will be progressed in the context of the overall package of commitments relating to carers contained in the programme. Any additional costs arising will be considered in a budget context having regard to overall resources available for social welfare schemes generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_2256">The development of a National Carers' Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" and the Programme for Government.  A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, has begun work on developing the strategy.  My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive.  To date the working group has held three meetings, in February March and April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group. Officials of  The Department of Social and Family Affairs have met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen's Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority.  A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March. The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are currently being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">"Towards 2016" commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and bodies attended.   The theme was the National Carers' Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  It is intended that a further meeting with carer groups will be held in early summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">The commitment to the development of a National Carers' Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008.  Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.  It is intended to publish the strategy later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  Under the proposals the lone parenthood category of payment would no longer exist.  Instead, a new payment would be made to all parents (living alone or with a partner), with young children, on low income.  This new payment is currently being developed in the Department, taking into account the various issues raised in the consultation process which continues to take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">Any proposed new payment scheme can only be introduced when the necessary coordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other relevant Departments and Agencies.  This is why the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion has been tasked with bringing forward a plan on the key issues of childcare, education, training and activation measures.  The non-income recommendations contained in the discussion paper were examined in two areas: Coolock and Kilkenny. These studies focused on identifying and resolving any practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced and took place between November 2007 and February 2008. They allow for the operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and Agencies to be considered and facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme and accompanying supports.  The outcome of the process is currently being considered in the Department. This will inform the further development of the proposals which I hope to bring to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_2266">Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement, the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement (FIS) with the increase for qualified children (IQC) and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single means-based child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.  This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016'.  Although NESC failed to reach a consensus on this issue, a research paper by Dr. John Sweeney was made available late in 2007 as a contribution to the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">In considering future policy, it is important to keep in mind the multiple objectives behind the provision of child income support and to maintain the correct balance between broad based supports such as child benefit and more targeted supports such as FIS and IQCs.  My Department has undertaken a review of this area adopting a two strand approach which includes an analysis of families already receiving FIS and an examination of possible FIS qualifying families who have not applied for payment.  This review, together with consideration of the issues raised in Dr. Sweeney's discussion paper, is expected to be available later in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2269">Child benefit is a universal payment, paid in respect of children up to the age of 16 years.  It continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families.  Commitment to this policy is reflected in the significant resources invested in the scheme since 2001, increasing monthly payments to €166.00 for each of the first two children and €203.00 for the third and subsequent children from April 2008. This represents increases of 336% and 310% respectively since 1997, compared to a 47% increase in the consumer price index over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">Although recent policy has been to concentrate additional resources on more targeted supports such as family income supplement, increase for qualified children and back to school support, Budget 2008 also provided for CB increases of €6 per month (lower rate) and €8 (higher rate) from April 2008.  This government is committed to improving the level of child income support and will continue to do so.  The information on rates of child benefit from 1994 to 2008 can be found in the following tabular statement.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2323">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">The school meals programme gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes, the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme and the school meals local projects programme.   Implementation of improvements in the programme is well underway.  Expenditure on the programme increased from €13.6m in 2006 to €27.16m in 2007, and is expected to be in the region of €32m in 2008. In 2006, some 1,394 schools with over 145,000 pupils benefited and this increased to over 185,000 pupils in over 1,900 schools in 2007.  The Department of Education and Science have identified a total of 875 disadvantaged schools under its ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS) action plan. These DEIS schools have been targeted for inclusion in the school meals local projects scheme and, to date, pupils from over 700 DEIS schools have benefited from the scheme.  The additional funding provided in 2008 will be used mainly to include more DEIS schools in the school meals local projects scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">The Back to School Clothing and Footwear scheme has been greatly improved also in recent years. The rates of back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) have been increased significantly.  Since 2005, the allowance has increased from €80 to €200 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and from €150 to €305 for those aged from 12 to 22 years.  These are increases of 150% and 103%, respectively.  In 2006, the income limits for BSCFA were increased by €50 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.  The numbers of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 161,000 in 2006 to over 180,000 in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">These improvements provide a major boost to families in meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.  The improvements in BSCFA are also very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for April 2008, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by almost 3% over the past twelve months.  Further improvements in the scheme will be considered in the context of next December's Budget in light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_962">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2330">I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 to 193, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">The commitment in the programme for Government in relation to the development of a mortgage support system is being advanced in the context of housing policy. Housing supports in general are provided by local authorities but the Department provides income maintenance support where required in particular circumstances.  Mortgage interest supplement provides income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. However, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods.  I am anxious that all avenues are explored as regards ways of providing support for those on long-term rent supplementation including options to support them in securing home ownership. One of the measures introduced to address this is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). Almost 13,000 tenants have been transferred from rent supplement scheme to RAS since 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">This and other measures are being considered in the context of overall housing policy, led by my colleague the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government. His Department already provides a range of housing supports through local government initiatives, including traditional social housing and RAS, both of which provide tenants with the benefit of Differential Rent. They also include shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. Any further initiatives in relation to mortgage support will be framed by that Department in the context of its "Delivering Homes — Sustaining Communities" housing policy statement and "Increasing Affordable Housing Supply" published in 2007. A public consultation on enhancement of the existing affordable housing mechanisms is now under way.  I consider that the current range of housing supports, together with the enhancements that may emerge from the current public consultation in relation to affordable housing, provide the potential to meet long-term housing needs in an appropriate and sustainable manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">With regard to commitments to review of the rent supplement scheme and the associated means test, significant changes in the means test for rent supplement were implemented last summer. These changes were designed to specifically facilitate people returning to work and those accepted as eligible for accommodation under RAS. Where a person, working up to 30 hours per week, has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregard for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">In addition, rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person who engages in full time employment, subject to their satisfying the improved means testing arrangements, as outlined above, and where they have been accepted as having a long term housing need under the RAS. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.  I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review, including the rent limits that apply within the scheme, and the Department will be working closely with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2337">The development of advocacy services for people with disabilities remains a priority for my Department. In order to expand advocacy provision for people with disabilities the Citizens Information Board began a process in 2004 of engaging the community and voluntary sector in the provision of advocacy services to people with disabilities. In this regard funding of €1million was allocated to the Citizens Information Board in 2005 to enable the introduction of the new service. An additional €1.4 million was allocated in 2006 to develop the work further and €1.9 million was allocated in 2007 for the development of a Personal Advocacy Service and for the implementation of the Disability Sectoral Plan. In line with the commitment to invest further in the Citizens Information Board, funding of €1.8 million was provided in 2008 for service developments which include advocacy services, bringing funding to €6.1 million for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">The Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme has to date developed and funded 47 advocacy projects. The Citizen Information Board is monitoring the programme to ensure that the projects are operating in accordance with the Board's advocacy guidelines. It is planned to undertake a full evaluation of the Community and Voluntary Sector Advocacy programme in 2010.  An organisational structure has been developed by the Citizens Information Board to meet the needs of the Personal Advocacy Service (PAS). The appointment to the new post of Director of PAS will be made shortly and the service will be launched when the Director has taken up the position, recruited the staff and is satisfied that the structures, resources and facilities are in place to allow the service to commence operation. The Personal Advocacy Service (PAS) will then be subject to continuing review when operational.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">The further investment in the Citizens Information Board's advocacy programmes and PAS will depend on the outcome of the evaluation and review and the level of demand for advocacy services.</p>

         the progress with the programme for Government commitment to urgently examine the introduction of free travel for Irish citizens of pension age particularly those resident in the UK when visiting Ireland and press the European Commission to examine a similar EU wide scheme and to replace the existing paper travel pass with a plastic card which can be used on all public transport services which offer the facility of free travel; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2341">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over and to people receiving certain disability or care payments.  Proposals to extend the free travel scheme to Irish born people living abroad and those receiving pensions from my Department have been examined and, in this regard, officials of the Department have engaged in discussions with EU Commission officials.  However, at this stage, it has not been possible to progress the matter as, under EU legislation, discrimination on grounds of nationality is prohibited.  More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">The Department is co-ordinating an interdepartmental initiative to develop a public services card.  This programme of work is known as the SAFE (Standard Authentication Framework Environment) initiative.  It has been agreed that the first iteration of the new card will be a replacement for the existing free travel pass.  The Department is currently working towards the introduction of this card towards the end of 2008.  The new card, which will include photo identification, will introduce a number of improvements, including an improved registration process and new card technology which will bring improved security features.</p>

            <p eId="para_2344">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The MABS has a unique and expert contribution to make in meeting the needs of people with debt difficulties in today's society.   This includes promoting greater awareness about household budgeting and shaping the strategies, especially those of services providers such as the banks and the credit unions, to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland. The MABS continues to work closely with the Financial Regulator in developing initiatives in this regard.  For example the MABS and the Financial Regulator have developed an education programme on money management for Transition Year students which will be rolled out to 120 schools from September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2346">Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy.   Since then it has been a requirement for significant policy proposals to indicate clearly the impact of the proposal on people in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.  Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) in my Department, produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment. The revised guidelines emphasise that the focus in the process should be on evaluating the outcomes of policies, programmes and services in terms of their potential impact on poverty and that poverty impact assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process. The guidelines are available on the OSI website at www.socialinclusion.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">Support for the work of the OSI in developing effective poverty proofing mechanisms is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the roll out of the revised guidelines is a priority in this regard.  The Office has commenced a pilot programme, to implement the new guidelines, with three government departments. All the pilots are at an early stage.  However, when completed they will provide models of best practice that will assist the OSI in its efforts to effectively embed poverty impact assessment as part of the policy making process across all government departments. In addition, the Office is working with the Combat Poverty Agency on applying the new guidelines in the local authorities.  My objective, in line with the Programme for Government, is to ensure that the new guidelines will serve as an effective tool in ensuring that the priority of combating poverty and social exclusion is kept to the fore in policy making and implementation at all levels of Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">The Family Support Agency was established on 6 May 2003 and brings together programmes and services to support families introduced by the Government in recent years.  Its mission is to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families.  Funding for the Agency has increased from €17.28 million in 2003 to €39.38 million for 2008.  The main functions of the Agency include: the Family and Community Services Resource Centre (FRC) Programme; the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling and related services; and the Family Mediation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">The FRC Programme was established in 1994 to help combat disadvantage by improving the function of the family unit. The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned. By the end of 2007, the number of Family Resource Centres had expanded from an original 10 to 106 nationwide. Funding increased from €317,500 (£250,000) in 1994 to €18.774m in 2007 with further provision for development under the NDP 2007 — 2013. In addition, funding has been allocated for an additional worker in 100 Family Resource Centres between 2007 and 2013.  For 2008 it is planned that a further 6 Family Resource Centres will come on stream. Funding for the programme for 2008 has increased to €21.436m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The Family Support Agency administers the Scheme of Grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, marriage preparation courses, child counselling services in relation to parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services on the death of a family member. A total of €9.929m was allocated in 2007 and some 553 organisations nationwide benefited from the Scheme. €11.033m has been made available under the Scheme in 2008 and over 600 applications for funding have been received. 2008 will also be the first year where groups in receipt of more than €60,000 per annum will be eligible to receive multi-annual funding, thus giving large groups the opportunity to make more long-term plans to develop the invaluable service that they provide to thousands of people across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The Family Mediation Service has expanded to 16 centres nationwide with another centre being operated on a pilot basis.  There are four full-time offices in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway with part-time offices situated in Athlone, Blanchardstown, Castlebar, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Raheny, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tralee, Waterford and Wexford, as well as the pilot office in Ballymun.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_979">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_2465">It is understood that the question refers to a meeting held by my predecessor, Minister Mary Hanafin T.D., with representatives from the Second Level Schools Network on the 22nd of April 2008.  The Second Level Schools Network represents nine schools all of which participate in DEIS, (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for Educational Inclusion.  DEIS focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years). Principle among the concerns raised by the network was the range of issues faced by schools because of the large number of newcomers enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_2466">Nationally, in the 2007/08 school year, there are 305,000 pupils in post-primary schools.  Of these, 21,000 were newcomer pupils.  There are over 160 nationalities represented in the primary and post primary schools.  The top  ten nationalities represented in post primary schools are UK, Poland, Nigeria, Lithuania, Spain, USA, Germany, the Philippines, Latvia and Romania.  In order to address the information needs of newcomers to Ireland, my Department has placed information on its website in six international languages including Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German.</p>
            <p eId="para_2467">In May 2007, Circular 53/2007 was issued to the Managerial Authorities in primary and post primary schools. This circular outlines the resources available to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language.  The limit of two Language Support Teachers per school was removed and the provision of language support was extended beyond two years, where a specific request is made. In fact, it is now possible for some schools with over 121 such pupils to have 6 language support teachers. There are now over 1,900 language support teacher posts allocated to primary and post primary schools, compared with just 262 in 2001/2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">The list of language subjects for the Leaving Certificate examination includes:  Irish, English, Ancient Greek Arabic, French, German, Hebrew Studies, Italian, Spanish, Japanese and Russian. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) also provides examinations in a range of languages referred to as the non-curricular EU languages. These are languages that do not appear as  part of the normal school curriculum but which students may opt to be examined in if they meet certain criteria. For example, candidates: are from a member state of the EU; speak the language in which they opt to be examined in as their mother tongue; have followed a programme of study leading to the Leaving Certificate; and are presenting also for Leaving Certificate English.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">In 2007 these examinations were offered in Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, modern Greek, Finnish, Polish, Estonian, Slovakian, Swedish, Czech, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Portuguese, Danish and Dutch. The model for the non-curricular language examination papers is based on the First Foreign Language final written paper of the European Baccalaureate.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA has developed Intercultural Guidelines to support primary and post-primary teachers and schools in developing a more inclusive learning environment and in providing students with the knowledge and skills they need to participate in an intercultural world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">My Department and the Language Policy Division of the Council of Europe have jointly published a Language Education Policy Profile for Ireland. This profile presents an analysis of the current state of language education in the primary and second level sectors in Ireland. It also pays particular attention to the language needs of immigrants for whom English is not their first language.  It outlines a range of policy principles and action priorities for the future. It promotes the development of plurilingualism in the education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has been commissioned by my Department to undertake a large scale study into how an increasing diversity of students impacts upon resource requirements and day to day teaching and learning. The research is organised in two phases, the first involving a national survey of primary and post-primary school principals and the second involving detailed case-studies of primary and post- primary schools. It is expected that this review will be completed in autumn 2008.  An evaluation of the provision of English as an Additional Language (EAL) will be conducted by the Inspectorate in a number of schools in 2008-09. This evaluation will focus on the quality of teaching and learning of English as an additional language that students experience in mainstream education and in support contexts in schools. It will help to inform policy in the area of supports for students learning English as an additional language.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">Following the review the Inspectorate will draw up Best Practice guidelines and define what is needed with regard to teaching English as a second language. A report will be prepared for mid 2009.  My Department will engage with the OECD thematic review of migrant education policy and practice which will be carried out by a team of OECD experts. The overarching policy question to be answered in this review is "What policies can promote successful education outcomes for first and second generation migrants?" This review will include pre-school, primary and post-primary education. It is expected that the OECD report will be completed by autumn 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">In conjunction with the HSE, my Department is working with education authorities in Northern Ireland to develop an information pack for immigrant parents on an all Ireland basis. The pack will have two versions for both sides of the border and will include information on education services, adult and community education programmes along with information on the health services, welfare entitlements, housing allocations etc. in each community. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has been appointed to develop the pack with a timeframe of Autumn 2008 for completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">With regard to the nine schools which belong to the Second Level Schools Network, as DEIS participants, these schools receive the following benefits under DEIS: access to the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) and Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA); additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on their level of disadvantage; additional funding under the School Books Grant Scheme; access to the Schools Meals Programme; access to the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL); access to a range of supports based on best practice of the School Completion Programme (SCP); access to transfer programmes; and access to planning supports.  Planning templates will be introduced in DEIS post primary schools in the coming school year: access to a range of professional development supports; enhanced guidance counselling provision (3 of the 9 schools are availing of this provision); and provision for school library and librarian supports (3 of the 9 schools are availing of this provision).</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">The nine schools in the network have the services of nine Home School Community Liaison Coordinators.  Home School Community Liaison helps to get parents involved in their children's education, which, as we all know, is a crucial component of convincing young people of the value of education.   The nine schools are spread across five School Completion Projects which target approximately 2000 children and young people. The projects include some 35 schools in the area and share €1.4 million in financial supports.  These financial supports allocated to each of the schools selected under DEIS provides for the inclusion of after school and holiday time support — for literacy and numeracy development as well as homework support, social and personal development and arts activities.  Additional financial resources amounting to €143,000 have been allocated to the 9 schools under DEIS to support their efforts in tackling disadvantage.  My Department intends to continue to work with, and provide appropriate support to, the Second Level Schools Network, and others, in order to achieve improved educational and social outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2492">In recognition of the responsibility which the Education Act has imposed on Boards of Management and the increasingly complex environment in which they must operate, the Teacher Education Section (TES) of my Department has developed a scheme for the provision of support to school management bodies for the purpose of training and development of boards of management in the  discharge of their duties and consistent with national and DES priorities.  Among the essential core areas covered in the training is Health &amp; Safety.  The issue of making defibrillators available to schools is a decision for each individual Board of Management to make in relation to their own school.</p>

            <p eId="para_2494">Where a site for a new school building is purchased by my Department the full cost of its construction is also provided. In these cases the building is owned by the Department and leased to an operator.  In general, where a school is not owned by my Department, a local contribution of 10 per cent of the project cost is required for school building projects. This is capped at €63,500 for new schools and €31,500 for extension/refurbishment projects. The amount of the local contribution for schools with disadvantaged status is 5% of the project cost subject to a maximum amount of €12,500. These arrangements have been approved by the Department of Finance and are of a general application.  As the Deputy is aware the Programme for Government commits my Department to abolish the local contribution to building projects and to the rental of accommodation. This matter is currently under consideration.</p>

With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past  few years, my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. Accordingly, there will not be a Summer Works Scheme for 2008. However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2500">My Department is progressing the acquisition of a number of sites under the Fingal School Model Agreement. The Fingal School Model is an agreement reached with Fingal County Council and is a partnership approach to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities throughout the Fingal Area. The intention is that the agreed approach will match the rapid pace of housing development in the area with the delivery of schools while at the same time providing important facilities for  community use.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">A site has been identified in Kellystown for the delivery of phase one of the primary provision to be made for the area and the Department intends, subject to finalisation of legalities surrounding site acquisition, to relocate an existing school in temporary accommodation to the new school 16 classroom building in Kellystown for September 2008 to meet the demand for school places.  My Department intends to acquire further land for the provision of a post primary school to serve the Dublin 15 area in due course.  A number of sites being acquired under the Fingal School Model are at varying stages of acquisition including the site at Kellystown and, as the Deputy will appreciate, due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisition, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_2617">My Department has established a number of measures to support and advise schools where pupils may experience behavioural and emotional difficulties.  All second level schools have been required to provide Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) as part of the junior cycle curriculum since September 2003. This course builds on SPHE in the Primary School Curriculum.  SPHE, when considered both at primary level and in the junior cycle, provides all students with opportunities to develop skills and competences to enable them to engage in responsible decision-making and to promote their physical, mental and emotional health and well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">In September 2003, my Department established the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas: Autism,  Challenging Behaviour, Dyslexia, and Inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the Education Centre network and/or through whole-staff in-school support.  The SESS have also provided targeted support for post-primary schools. Funding is also provided through the SESS for on-line training in Managing Student Behaviour, Inclusion, Dyslexia, Understanding Autism, ADHD, Applied Behaviour Analysis, Gifted and Talented Students and Teaching Troubled Children. These online courses are run by the Institute of Child Education and  Psychology Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2619">In 2006 the National Behaviour Support Service was established. A National Co-ordinator and five Assistant National Co-ordinators have been appointed In addition, ten Regional Development Officers and fourteen part-time Associates were recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A Research Officer has been appointed and will carry out research  of current Irish and international literature and test against reality situations in Irish schools. This should provide an invaluable benchmark of the level of disruption in schools and the effectiveness of intervention by the  NBSS. A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2620">Since their appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues: The development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement; The development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour; On-going training for the NBSS team; and research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2621">The NBSS is currently working with 50 selected schools throughout the country.  Behaviour Support Classrooms have been established and staffed in 30 of these 50 schools. These classrooms provide an individualised intensive intervention programme for a targeted group of students. The Behaviour Support Classrooms are staffed by at least one qualified whole-time teacher. The Board of Management of the schools concerned have flexibility in relation to the employment of another whole-time teacher equivalent and may employ people with different expertise to cater for the needs of the students involved. I want to  emphasise however that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour. They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement. The NBSS also propose to produce a training CD/DVD on all aspects of challenging behaviour, within the  Irish context. It is envisaged that this would be available to all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2622">A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a team of four psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way.  In addition all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an  assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2623">It has always been the policy of NEPS, within the normal boundaries of finance and process, to endeavour to respond positively and flexibly to extraordinary need and circumstance as presented by school authorities on occasion and it is open to school Principals who have urgent needs for pupil assessment in excess of allocation to discuss the matter with the local NEPS Regional Director.  My Department is committed to supporting schools and I want to advise the Deputy that since its establishment the number of psychologists allocated to NEPS has trebled.</p>

            <p eId="para_2633">The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in any given area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places.  This approach ensures that the use of existing accommodation is maximised and that the development and support of one school over others does not occur.  As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in the Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas, including the areas referred to by the Deputy.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2634">In this context, the status of all schools in these centres is being assessed as part of an overall delivery plan, which is currently being formulated within the Developing Areas Unit.  In addition Forward Planning Section of the Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2642">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 315 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools, 27 of these classes are in Co. Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">Children in these classes benefit from having fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS).  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">The Deputy may be aware that in order to support teachers my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in specific interventions associated with autism including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.  A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team.</p>

            <p eId="para_2646">The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions.  This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based.  That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last Summer.  It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments, to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.  This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2648">All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to class size are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment.  In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment all things considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2649">Similarly the commitment in relation to improving class size in second level schools can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years and the competing priorities for available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_2660">Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the Board of Management of each individual school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.  The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  In general my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a  particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with Equal Status legislation.   In the event of additional accommodation being required at short notice it is open to a school to apply to my Department for the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2678">In 2007 the school in question received approval to build additional classrooms under the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme (PAS).  The purpose of the PAS is to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake building works which will address the school's long term accommodation needs.  Under the terms of the Scheme, school authorities are empowered to manage these works with guidance from and minimal interaction with the Department.  Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs; rather the terms of the Scheme require the schools to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.  The Board of Management submitted an appeal for additional funding which was unsuccessful.  They were advised to use the grant to achieve the maximum accommodation possible taking into consideration the extra cost which has arisen.</p>

A large volume of the appeals outstanding more than 6 months in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is due to the delay in processing appeals pending the granting of access to Tribunal Decisions following the Supreme Court judgement (in the Atanasov case) on the matter. Following the judgement the RAT set up a comprehensive data bank of previous decisions of the Tribunal, suitably redacted, which is readily available for access by legal representatives of applicants. This data bank, along with other measures being applied by RAT, will be of considerable assistance in clearing the current backlog of cases.  Other factors such as adjournments, postponements and judicial reviews can also impede the Tribunal from completing cases earlier. High quality, consistent and fair decision making in all cases continues to be a high priority in the Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_2742">*The Department of the Environment and Local Government passed over responsibility for asylum seeker accommodation to the Reception and Integration Agency on 1 January 2003. In 2002, that Department reported a spend of €88.85M on asylum seeker accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2743">**The figures for 2007 are provisional and may be subject to change until publication of the 2007 appropriation accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2744">Additional costs are borne by other Departments and Offices, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  The Deputy should note that the costs incurred under subhead D1 include the total cost of running the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) which includes the delivery of services across Asylum, Immigration, Naturalisation and Visa areas. The provisional expenditure under Subhead D1 for 2007 also includes expenditure on a number of  major IT projects which will improve efficiency and customer service in asylum and immigration areas once completed. A significant proportion of the overall costs to my Department in delivering asylum services are in relation to the provision of asylum seeker accommodation, as can be seen from the table above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2745">As INIS costs are not exclusive to asylum services and as asylum costs are borne by other Government Departments and organisations it is not possible to provide an average cost to the State for an asylum seeker per annum.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill published in January of this year, and which is currently at Committee stage of the Dáil, comprehensively reforms and simplifies the current refugee status determination process. It proposes, inter alia, the introduction of a single procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection presented by applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">This change of the processing framework will remove the current multi-layered and sequential process and will thereby allow an applicant to get a final decision on their application in a more efficient manner. Together with other provisions of the Bill, it is anticipated that the time required to reach a final decision in a given case will be reduced, which can only be in the interests of the applicant and indeed the protection of the integrity of the refugee status determination process.</p>

         the level of funding for domestic violence allocated by the State in each of the past ten years; the number and location of refuges funded or part funded by the Government; if there are proposals to increase the State funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2748">The Deputy will appreciate that funding for action on domestic violence encompasses direct action by identifiable victim support services as well as a broad range of actions across the justice, health, housing, education and family support sectors. Moreover, actions particularly by the State sector to deal with domestic violence may be part of a wider family support programme which is not identifiable under a domestic violence heading. The overlap between domestic violence and other family and community issues, for example in terms of Garda Síochána and Health Service Executive (HSE) frontline staff action, creates a challenge to the quantification of the total State allocation on this issue. This is one of the issues which will be addressed, insofar as is possible, in the context of the preparation of the proposed National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2749">I can inform the Deputy that the bulk of direct funding in relation to domestic violence service provision is provided by the HSE which funds the core work of the NGO support services in this sector.  Prior to the establishment of the HSE, the Department of Health and Children provided this funding through the Health Boards. The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government provides funding through the local authorities for the capital and maintenance costs of women's refuges and other crisis accommodation.  In the timeframe available it has not been possible to provide a detailed reply to the broad question raised by the Deputy. I can provide information in relation to my own Department and I have requested details of direct funding allocated to domestic violence from all the other Departments concerned.  In addition I have sought information from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the HSE on the number and location of refuges funded or part-funded by the Government.  I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">Direct funding by my Department has been allocated in relation to awareness raising and perpetrator intervention programmes.  The Deputy should note that funding for awareness raising includes funding for both domestic and sexual violence.</p>

            <p eId="para_3014">I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3015">The Greener Homes Scheme provides support to homeowners to invest in a range of domestic renewable energy heating technologies including solar panels, biomass boilers and stoves and heat pumps.  There has been a strong interest in the scheme since it was launched in March 2006.  On foot of the achievement of the original scheme targets three years ahead of schedule, Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme was closed on 3 September 2007.  Phase II of the scheme was opened on 1 October 2007 with assistance still provided under the above mentioned headings.  The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  Continuing the scheme is helping secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.  The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review, and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing technologies and market developments, including the consideration of additional technologies such as wood log gasifiers.</p>

         asked the

         if there are grant supports or other incentives available to a company wishing to install a HIBrite energy efficient lighting system at its retail premises.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3018">Section 46 of the Finance Act 2008 provides that companies may claim 100% of the capital cost of certain energy efficient plant and machinery, including lighting, against taxable profits in year of purchase.  The scheme is expected to commence in July 2008 and run for 3 years.  Other product categories covered are lighting controls, motors, variable speed drives and building energy management systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3019">The purpose of the scheme is to encourage businesses to purchase plant and machinery that is highly energy efficient.  Over the lifetime of such products, the energy used is generally a more significant cost to business than the purchase cost.  Energy efficient products are more economical over their lifetime and are a sound investment for business.  However, despite their economic advantages, businesses have been slow to change their purchase habits.   I expect that the tax incentives provided through this scheme will help persuade companies to re-evaluate their purchase policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3020">Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has drafted product efficiency criteria following a public/industry consultation and these are likely to be published in the coming weeks, with an invitation to manufacturers to submit their eligible products for inclusion on the Approved List for the purpose of the Section 46 tax allowance.  It will be necessary for the manufacturers or suppliers of HIBrite to assess their products against these criteria and if deemed eligible, to apply to SEI for inclusion on the List.  I expect to make an Order under Section 46 in July this year adopting the efficiency criteria in law, together with the Approved Lists of products under those criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_3022">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I have no function in the matter of the enabling for broadband purposes of exchanges owned by private companies.  However, it is hoped that the facilitation of greater competition via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms will encourage the more rapid enabling of all exchanges for broadband.  My role as Minister is to promote the necessary statutory and regulatory framework to facilitate competition between the private providers.</p>
