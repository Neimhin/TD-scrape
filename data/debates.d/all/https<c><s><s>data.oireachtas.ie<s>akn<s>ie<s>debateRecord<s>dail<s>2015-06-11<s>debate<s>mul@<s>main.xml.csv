It seeks to get some idea as to when the roll-out of the Leader programme will happen and when it is expected to be operational throughout the State from the north to the south and from the east to the west. I hope the Minister can clarify when this will happen and when we can expect the money to flow.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	The Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2014–2020 will provide €250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities. Under stage one of the selection process for the new programme, any entity wishing to be considered as a local action group was invited to submit an expression of interest. For the purpose of the new programme, there are 28 sub-regional areas in Ireland, and 45 separate expressions of interest were received. A single expression of interest has been received in 19 of the 28 areas and at least two expressions of interest have been received in the remaining nine areas. In areas where multiple expressions of interest were received, my Department has given an undertaking to facilitate discussions between the relevant entities with a view to engaging all parties and, if possible, reaching an agreement to develop one coherent local development strategy for their area. In this regard, my Department commenced meetings last week with a range of entities, and these will continue over the coming period. In the meantime, I expect that all of the expressions of interest will be presented to an independent evaluation committee for assessment and decision by late June. On foot of this, preparatory support will be made available to all eligible local action groups selected by the committee. The groups will then be provided with a minimum of six months to develop their strategies, but I expect some strategies to be submitted earlier than this. The independent evaluation committee will also assess and make the final decisions with regard to the quality of the local development strategies. In areas where a single strategy is submitted, the committee in question will review and evaluate these strategies with a view to ensuring that the strategies meet the required standard. In areas where entities do not come to an agreement and multiple strategies are submitted, it will be a matter for the evaluation committee to a make a decision on which local development strategy best meets the needs of the community. Notwithstanding this, I anticipate that the new programme will be operational in some areas by autumn 2015 and hopefully in all communities by early 2016.

The Minister of State mentioned a minimum of six months, but I accept that there is a maximum of six months to get the plan in. From the end of June, a maximum of six months gives one up to end of January, after which the applications have to be evaluated and the contracts agreed. As the Minister of State is aware, there are always delays, questions and issues; it is part of the job. Will she accept that it is optimistic to suggest that any of the Leader programmes will be rolled out before the end of 2015, given that there are only five months from the end of this month? In respect of areas where there is more than one expression of interest, when does the Minister of State think, in reality, she will have signed contracts and will be in a position to accept applications for Leader funding? When will the programme be up and running as far as the community is concerned, allowing for the time taken to carry out evaluations, agree contracts and go through the small print and clauses?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	As the Deputy mentioned, there will be a maximum of six months to develop the strategy. From speaking with the people in this space, the development companies and the local community development committee, LCDC, structures, I know they are working hard on getting their strategy together. I do not envisage any delay in the process. Everyone is working hard to draw down this money and get it into the communities. That is not only the priority for me but it is also the priority of the people on the LCDCs and Leader companies. The Department is doing everything it can to facilitate the process. I do not expect any particular delay. The process this time around is different from the process on the last occasion. Once the local development strategy is decided on, that is the trigger for the drawing down of moneys, so I do not expect any delays.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Will the Minister of State confirm that once the strategy is submitted, for which I understand there are significant requirements, there will be a requirement for an evaluation and that issues may arise in regard to the strategy that may need clarification? Once the evaluation has been agreed and the strategy has been agreed, contractual arrangements will have to be entered into with the companies. As I correct in saying that it is only when the contractual arrangements are agreed with the companies and the contract is signed that the companies can actually start accepting applications for Leader funding?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I accept what the Deputy is saying.I do not have a crystal ball so I cannot say exactly what will happen in the future, but I try to deal with the problem when it arises. We are going through a process and we should allow this process to take place. If it does throw up any difficulties, we will deal with them.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	My question concerns the terms of reference of the inquiry into planning matters into Donegal. Will the inquiry be in a position to question current and former members and current and former staff of Donegal County Council?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	On 14 June 2013, the High Court made an order quashing that part of my Department's planning review report of 2012 relating to Donegal following a settlement between my Department and the party concerned who had brought judicial review proceedings in respect of that part of the report. The matter has been disposed of to the satisfaction of both sides. In light of these proceedings, my Department subsequently sought the advice of the Attorney General on how best to proceed in the case of issues raised relating to planning matters in Donegal. I have now considered what next steps need to be taken in this regard, taking account of advice from the Office of the Attorney General. In that context, my Department is finalising arrangements for the imminent appointment on a non-statutory basis of a senior counsel nominated by the Attorney General to prepare a report relating to the matters concerned. This report will be prepared in line with terms of reference which have been agreed in consultation with the Attorney General's office.  The arrangements involved in the preparation of the report will be announced in due course. It will be a matter for the appointed senior counsel to determine how best to undertake the preparation of the report relating to these matters, including engagement with any relevant persons. I would expect that the same person will engage with all relevant parties in order to deal with this issue in a satisfactory way.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The Minister said he was about to appoint a senior counsel to examine the irregularities complained about in Donegal and that this would be done on a non-statutory basis. The consultants examining the other six counties under scrutiny were appointed on a statutory basis, so why is this being done on a non-statutory basis? The Minister said he was in discussions with the Attorney General about the terms of reference, that the senior counsel would put those together and that they would be published, but the terms of reference for the senior counsel heading this up are of the utmost importance. There could be very different outcomes depending on the terms of reference and the areas that are looked at. Can the Minister also tell us what authority the senior counsel will have to call and question former officials and relevant persons who are the subject of complaints and who have now finished their employment with Donegal County Council?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I have no reason to believe that the senior counsel will not get the full co-operation of everyone. I am satisfied that proceeding on a non-statutory basis is probably the most efficient and quickest way of dealing with this. I note that there was full co-operation relating to the previous review, even though this report was then the subject of High Court proceedings. In the unlikely event that there is some issue with co-operation, I have no issue reconsidering it and putting it on a statutory basis, but I want to get this done as quickly as possible so we can get to the bottom of the issues once and for all. My Department is currently engaging with senior counsel nominated by the Attorney General. Obviously there is a lot of preparatory work to be done, and a fee proposal relating to the work is imminent. Subject to agreement on that, we will be in a position to announce the person who will carry out the review.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank the Minister for that reply, but I must say that people who are no longer in the employment of the council may not feel as compelled to co-operate with any inquiry. Any investigation that does not question these individuals would not be of much use. A number of serious allegations have been made by a former planner, Gerard Convie. A total of 20 cases have been sent to the Department. Will the inquiry investigate those cases? Serious allegations are also being made in respect of the Greystones area in Wicklow. Will there be any investigation into them?  We were promised that the office of the planning regulator would be established, as recommended by the Mahon tribunal. When are we likely to see this?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The legislation for the office of the planning regulator will be coming through in the autumn. Subsequent to the passing of that legislation, the office will be put in place, which is something I presume the Deputy welcomes. The case of Wicklow is under thorough consideration by my Department and I expect to be able to make some comments on that in the very near future. The Deputy knows that I cannot go into the allegations to which he referred, but the process we are putting in place will ensure that it is dealt with as efficiently and quickly as possible. As the Deputy is aware, it has been going on for some time. I believe that what we have put in place is the best way of dealing with it. Of course, we will constantly review it, but we are expecting full co-operation from all those involved. My Department has already written to the chief executive of Donegal County Council advising him of the appointment of a senior counsel. As soon as the contract is signed and the senior counsel is in place, we will ensure everybody is written to as part of this process.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	We are moving away from the rent allowance model for private rented accommodation for people on the housing list, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, and long leasing are being used by the vast majority of people. The problem is that individuals must source the accommodation and it is very precarious in the absence of a change in the environment at local government level.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	Addressing the current challenges relating to homelessness is a top priority for me and my Department. I will not say there is any silver bullet or that it is easy, but we are trying every combination we can. It is not about funding. It really is about trying to ensure we can put in place all the strategies that will work. I have put in place a special task force to oversee the work of an interdisciplinary unit to source additional accommodation for homeless families.  The task force meets weekly under the guidance of the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and myself. My Department is in regular contact with other Departments, State agencies, local authorities and a range of stakeholders from the NGO sector relating to homelessness issues. This issue is dealt with on a daily and weekly basis in my Department and is constantly being monitored. Formal arrangements in place include the joint forum of the cross-Department team on homelessness and the national homelessness consultative committee, which met on 4 June, and the high-level homelessness policy implementation team, which last met on 15 May. This issue is also raised very regularly at meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy chaired by An Taoiseach. The level of engagement is very high. The number of families presenting to local authorities as homeless has increased. I accept that rising rents are a major issue and we must address the issue of supply. I have already announced a suite of measures, of which the Deputy is well aware, to increase the supply of social housing. I have also established a suite of measures to help people who are vulnerable to becoming homeless. We are monitoring this constantly. We are also trying to roll out other protocols relating to intercepting people who are vulnerable.These protocols have worked well in Dublin and have been rolled out in Cork and we are looking at rolling them out. In some cases they are managed by Threshold but it need not always be the one agency. Anyway, those protocols have worked well. Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a query as regards the local authorities and a change in mindset. I would be interested to hear more detail on what the Deputy is offering on the matter. Certainly I can assure her that we are constantly on to the local authorities as regards dealing with this issue, providing extra funding and providing a considerable number of extra staff as well.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	The short term is the real problem. The Minister is right about rising rents and said he is dealing with this every day but I am dealing with this every day as well and from what I can see, it is not working. There is a county boundary which delineates my area from the Dublin area. The tenancy protection environment in the Dublin area is very different from what we experience. I see vulnerable groups finding it impossible to secure accommodation. I see families being broken up and cases where one person in a family is sleeping in the car while the children are being farmed out and do not get to school. Real damage is being done. If we are moving to a different model, we cannot have a situation where people have the entire responsibility to source the accommodation themselves, because some people will simply find it impossible. We find that people are being moved away from resources, for example, children with special needs. When they have to move, very often the resources cannot move with them. What I am seeing in my area is pure chaos. There is an urgency about this issue and about extending what is available in Dublin to other areas.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	We have made a number of changes. We have put substantial amounts of funding into it and I hope the Deputy acknowledges that. There is no silver bullet as regards the necessity to provide extra supply. The funding is in place up to 2020 and it is a substantial amount. We have works programmes with the local authorities for social housing. That work is ongoing, as everyone is aware. However, there is a time lag. The Deputy referred to the commuter areas. I agree that there are specific pressures there which need to be addressed in a different way, and we are looking at addressing them. We have changed protocols as regards the volume of accommodation provided and prioritised for people who are vulnerable and homeless. This is something we review on a monthly basis. We are looking at extending the intervention mechanism to which I referred earlier to commuter areas because of the fact the pressures in many of the commuter areas, in particular, in Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, are similar to the issues faced by many people in Dublin. This is something we are addressing through the local authorities as well. There is an increase in the prioritisation of funding as regards how we can turn around stock quickly in the case of voids and in other areas.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I acknowledge resources are being provided but much of that is medium-term. If someone arrives at my office tomorrow morning, I cannot say to him or her there is no silver bullet. He or she will want a solution tomorrow if facing homelessness on Monday, and often that is the case. Not a day goes by that I do not have people in my office with these problems. This has been the case now for a year or more. One of the problems is the definition of homelessness. In many cases, local authorities take it to be what was deemed as traditional homelessness - I hate to use that term. Anyway, a mindset change is needed because there is a different housing model. People are not being listed as homeless or at risk of homelessness in some local authorities because of that definition. There needs to be a change in the culture, arrangements and rights to ensure that people have a right to shelter. I am not suggesting that they should have fantastic houses in the locations they want necessarily, but the basic point is that they have a right to shelter. A change in mindset and institutional change is needed.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I will offer two observations, or comments. I deal with this as a Deputy rather than as a Minister as well. The priority is to keep people in their homes and to put in place as many intervention mechanisms as possible to do that. We are continuously rolling those out. We have 80 directions in respect of homelessness and trying to keep people in their homes. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Some of the tactics - for want of a better phrase - work in some areas and do not in others. It is my desire to extend the protocols to which I referred. The issue raised by Deputy Catherine Murphy on the mindset of local authority staff and management on this issue would be a concern of mine if I believed it to be widespread across local authorities, but I do not detect that. On the basis of what Deputy Murphy has said, I will re-emphasise this. There is a differentiation between what many people see as homelessness, that is, those who are, unfortunately, sleeping on the streets, etc. and the new homeless, including families, etc. A differentiation applies. Obviously, we have dealt fairly quickly with many of the issues with the rough sleepers, but the prioritisation, without a shadow of a doubt, now relates to vulnerable families and people like that. The idea is to try to have the protocols in place to intercept them. That is the priority and that is what we are pushing across the local authorities. I can assure Deputy Murphy of that.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	This question relates to the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014. We have seen a major downturn in the construction of one-off houses, up to 70% in some cases, year-on-year according to the most recent figures produced. Ridiculous prices are also being charged, as was predicted. Many of the doomsday scenarios we had predicted associated with this legislation have, unfortunately, come home to roost. Has the Minister taken note of these reductions? Has he taken note of the consternation that it has caused in the one-off house-building sector? When can the Minister expect to address this issue, further to his recent announcements on same?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	The Government’s Construction 2020 strategy sets out a comprehensive package of measures to restore the construction sector to a sustainable position within our economy and sets out a number of actions to increase the supply of good quality houses to meet a growing demand. My Department is the lead Department for a range of the Construction 2020 actions in the areas of housing and planning. Strong progress is being made, as demonstrated by the roll-out of the social housing strategy and the ongoing work on new planning legislation. Deputy Cowen raised the matter of regulatory costs. The Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015 provides for amendments to the Part V provisions on social and affordable housing in the Planning Acts. There will be an opportunity in the coming days to debate some of the aspects of this. As a result of the Government's proactive and focused approach, house building activity is now showing clears signs of recovery. Moreover, we now have a credible building control regulatory framework in place, underpinned by the new arrangements introduced by SI 9 of 2014. In overall terms, I am satisfied that the new building control regime represents a reasonable and appropriate response to the many building failures that occurred in the past decade and will lead to improved quality within the construction sector, something we would all welcome. However, I am conscious that concerns have been raised relating to the costs imposed by SI 9 of 2014 relating to single dwellings, including self-builds and extensions, as referred to by the Deputy. As Minister of State, I have a responsibility to ensure that the cost of compliance with regulations is fair, reasonable and proportionate. I have already publicly indicated my willingness to consider concerns expressed and take whatever steps are reasonable and appropriate to address them. A broad review of SI 9 of 2014 is currently under way and includes a special focus on the impact of the regulations on single dwellings and extensions in particular. A report on the key concerns raised during the review and the recommended course of action for addressing these concerns will be prepared by my Department in the coming weeks with a view to ensuring that any changes deemed appropriate will be effected as a matter of priority subsequently.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I welcome that the Minister of State has committed to considering the key concerns emerging from the review with a view to amending the regulations introduced by statutory instrument in 2014. I urge him to ensure his Department and those who have responsibility in this area move swiftly to rectify the problems that have arisen in regard to one-off house building and extensions to houses because they are causing fear and consternation. I ask him to move speedily in addressing these issues.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I acknowledge the Deputy's views. New housing completions in 2014 amounted to 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure, with a further 2,639 units completed in quarter one of this year, an increase of 26% on the previous year. The projections for increased housing output are positive. In respect of planning permissions in the pipeline, planning permissions were granted for 2,144 dwelling units in the third quarter of 2014, compared to 1,400 in the same period of the previous year. This represents an increase of 52%. In line with the general collapse in economic and construction activity, the one-off house building sector contracted dramatically in the period from 2005 to 2013, with the number of units built falling from more than 19,000 to just under 3,000. Positive signs can now be seen, however, with 864 commencement notices for one-off homes recorded during the first four months of this year. If this level of activity persists, we can expect between 2,500 to 3,000 one-off homes to be developed in the current year. I take note of the Deputy's concerns, however, and hope to address them in the coming weeks.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	In February, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government confirmed that the number of commencements had decreased since the introduction of the building control (amendment) regulations. It indicated that more than 5,000 construction projects commenced since the new regulations took effect on 1 March 2014, of which more than 1,100 were new build single dwellings. In comparison, the total number of commencement notices lodged for 2013, an historic low point for activity, was 7,456, including 3,000 for one-off houses. That underlines my point that the construction of one-off housing and extensions declined by up to 70%. Rather than argue the figures, I acknowledge the commitment made by the Minister of State in regard to the review and ask that the concerns expressed by those in the construction sector and engineering professionals are addressed by amending the regulations.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	The Deputy will agree that dramatic decrease in one-off house construction was due to a number of reasons, primary among them the economic consequences of the crash and access to credit for young people who wanted to build homes on their own land. It is not entirely due to the cost of regulations but the Minister and I have undertaken to review the regulations after one year. I met all the stakeholders in the Custom House and I listened carefully to their concerns. A number of detailed submissions have been made and they are currently being reviewed and analysed. We will be considering them further in the coming weeks and I hope to respond appropriately to any concerns. We must be conscious of the need for quality and sustainability in housing construction, as well as learn from the mistakes of the past, but I acknowledge that genuine concerns arise and I will endeavour to address them.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I tabled this question on foot of a letter I requested under the Freedom of Information Act 2014. I am seeking clarity on the assumptions behind the departmental position paper to which the letter refers.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	The programme for Government included a proposal to establish Irish Water, a State-owned water company that would take over the water investment and maintenance programmes of the 34 city and county councils who acted as water services authorities. The programme of financial support for Ireland with the EU, IMF and ECB also required the preparation of proposals for implementation of the recommendations for an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water service provision to a water utility and the introduction of water charges. A team led by PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed through an open competition to conduct the independent assessment.  The first part of this study, the Irish Water phase one report, was published for public consultation in January 2012 along with a departmental position paper setting out the overall approach to reforms in the water sector. This six week public consultation lasted from 16 January 2012 to 24 February 2012 and covered a range of water sector reforms, including the establishment of a new public utility, Irish Water, to take over the responsibility for the delivery of water services from local authorities; the introduction of water charges based on metered usage, with the metering programme to commence later in 2012; and the introduction of independent economic regulation of the water sector under the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The aim in conducting this public consultation was to facilitate a more informed and inclusive debate on the fundamental reforms proposed for the water sector.  These reforms sought to ensure that the appropriate organisation and funding models were in place to deliver water services to existing and future users, while also providing the volume and quality of water and waste water services required to protect public health and support employment.   The Deputy's question pertains to a letter which was one of the 270 submissions made to my Department in response to this public consultation. All of the submissions, of which 32 were from companies, were published on the Department’s website, together with the implementation strategy for the water sector reform programme in December 2012. I cannot speculate on the assumptions made by the company in question when it was formulating its response to the public consultation. The Government is committed to maintaining Irish Water in public ownership.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I accept that the company is making the assumptions to which I refer but its letter states:There should however be an exit/separation strategy in the event that the Water utility needed to be in a stand alone position at some time in the future. A key consideration for this approach is the method of providing funding during the start up phase and the impact of the eventual sale.Why would the company presume that the water utility would eventually be sold if it was responding to a position paper? I did not find anything in the paper that would lead it to that conclusion. I tabled the question to find out whether there was an underlying assumption in this regard and whether a dialogue had been entered into on the Government's long-term intentions for the ownership of the new entity.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I appreciate the reasons for the Deputy's questions but I cannot make assumptions on what Siemens was thinking. It is a private company. Similarly, I cannot make assumptions about any of the other submissions made during the public consultation. The letter from Siemens, which I have read, was received during the public consultation phase and raises a number of issues and recommendations on how the establishment of the entity should proceed and how the metering programme should be implemented. I genuinely do not know the assumptions behind its participation in the consultation, nor does my Department. It made its own assumptions and it wrote the letter on that basis. It was a matter for those participating in the public consultation to offer ideas or raise concerns based on their own assumptions. Those assumptions were the company's business, although I do not agree with many of them.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I take it that the assumption that there was ever any intention to sell the utility off is completely its own and had nothing to do with the political approach that was being taken.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	Absolutely. I cannot speak on behalf of Siemens which made its own assumptions, and in this case I would say wrongly. I do not know; that is just my opinion. I do not know on what it based its assumptions. I have no idea. As part of an early round of public consultation, it made its decision to submit its letter, offering ideas and concepts. It made assumptions for that. I have no idea on what it based those assumptions. I have no information to suggest it based its assumptions on anything except itself and possibly another party with which it may have discussed putting forward this submission. In many cases I think its assumptions are wrong obviously. As the Deputy knows, I feel very strongly on the whole issue of public ownership. That is the bottom line.

As the Minister of State will know, sadly, I come from the capital of the country when it comes to unfinished housing estates with four times the national average. Under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, an estate can be taken in charge through two mechanisms. Either the developer can make a request or the majority of residents in the estate can do so. The original law specified the majority of people who were on the register of electors. This was amended and it is now the majority of the owners. In some cases, there are a substantial number of absentee landlords or people in financial difficulty with banks who cannot get the deeds for the property or do not want to do so. This makes it very difficult, where there is no developer, to have these estates taken into charge. Will the Minister of State amend the legislation?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I thank the Deputy for tabling the question. I know the Roscommon men are resilient - they had a good win in the hurling last week, so the Deputy's injury will not stop him. Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides that for estates, which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the planning permission, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.  In the case of estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced against the developer within seven years of the expiration of the planning permission relating to the development, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners of the housing units, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures. That was outlined by the Deputy. My Department is currently reviewing, in the context of the forthcoming planning and development (No. 2) Bill, the section 180 provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates with a view to improving and streamlining the relevant procedures. A particular focus of the review will be the time limits for the taking in charge of housing estates and my Department will consult with planning authorities in this regard. It is intended that the planning and development (No. 2) Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. There will be further opportunity for detailed debate during the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I expect to take place in the autumn.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	When the Minister of State is responding, he might address the question I have asked. Will he revert back to the original legislation? I bring a second issue to the attention of the Minister of State on the taking-in-charge process. I refer to the drawdown of bonds where the developer is gone and the estate is incomplete. In a number of instances in my part of the country, insurance companies are not releasing the bonds. They are licensed here to operate in this jurisdiction. One, in particular, that is causing significant problems is HCC International, which will not engage with the local authorities. It is not just the insurance companies. Bank of Ireland is very slow to engage, as is IBRC, which has stated it will not deliver on the bonds in place for developments. How can we get local authorities to finish out these estates and ensure that people can live in a habitable housing estates if pillar banks are dragging their heels, if the State-owned IBRC is not honouring bonds and if insurance companies licensed by the State and have bonds here are not willing to release those bonds to have those estates completed in line with the agreements in place?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I again confirm that we will revise the planning legislation in the autumn and plan to strengthen and streamline the taking-in-charge protocols and processes to assist local authorities to deal with the many legacy issues the Deputy has outlined. Strong progress has been made with estates that local authorities have registered as unfinished. More than 3,000 such unfinished estates were registered in 2011. They have been resolved to the extent that there are now fewer than 900 throughout the country with the help of the special resolution funds and funds put in place by local authorities. That is not to confuse it with the taking in charge of estates where there are many legacy issues, including infrastructure deficits, and developers or builders having gone off site. Those legacy issues have to be dealt with by the local authorities, which have the appropriate powers to pursue developers to ensure that those estates are finished to a proper standard. Every citizen living in an estate is entitled to a house that is finished to a high quality and a proper standard. Developers and builders have a responsibility in this regard. Local authorities have the appropriate powers to pursue them in the interests of citizens.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I have no difficulty with the local authorities living up to their responsibilities. However, in a large number of estates in counties Galway and Roscommon, the developer is gone and is not to be found. When the planning permission was granted, IBRC, which is owned by the State, put bonds in place for some of these developers. Now this State agency is not honouring these bonds. The insurance companies that were licensed by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority issued commitments and bonds that they are not honouring. Even pillar banks, such as Bank of Ireland, are dragging their heels over releasing bonds in cases where there is no developer and people are living in what are still building sites. Those bonds were a condition of the planning permission. Fees were paid by the developer to ensure a bond was put in place. Now we find that some of the supposedly most reputable organisations in the country are washing their hands of it and letting people remain in these half-finished estates without releasing the money to get them completed.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	The bonds were put in place almost as an insurance policy. Where a developer does not complete an estate to a proper standard, they can be drawn down. It is the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that those bonds are put in place in a comprehensive and secure way. It is also the responsibility of the local authority, in the interest of the citizens who live on such estates, to pursue the developers. If the developers have gone off site and cannot be pursued further, the local authority must engage with the credit institutions, banks and insurance firms that are providing those bonds. The local authorities have the power to pursue those and it is their responsibility to do so. In the planning Bill that will come to the House in the autumn, we hope to strengthen that process and we are open to proposals from the opposite side, including the Deputy's views. I look forward to further engagement at that time on how we can strengthen the hand of local authorities. These are further legacy issues we need to address. We are making strong progress in many estates. Some are outstanding and it is very frustrating, but local authorities must continue to pursue those who are responsible. They cannot always fall back on the taxpayer to bail out the developers who went off-site without finishing the estates. Local authorities have the power to pursue them and those banks have responsibility to pay them also.

My question is how much money is expected to come in this year, net of outflows. It normally comes in during April. What are the plans this year to spend the Dormant Accounts Fund on social and economic disadvantage, educational disadvantage and on disability?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	Under the dormant accounts legislation, balances on dormant accounts with banks, building societies and An Post and the net encashment value of certain life assurance policies are paid into the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. The primary purpose of the legislation is to reunite the original account holders with their moneys, including all interest due. In addition, the legislation provides that disbursements from the fund may be made for charitable purposes or for purposes of community benefit, as the Deputy outlined. Financial institutions transfer dormant funds to the NTMA, generally as one block transaction on 30 April each year. Information from the NTMA as of the end of April 2015 indicated inflows of approximately €36 million this year. The 2012 Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act provides for an action plan to give effect to the scheme and full details of the measures adopted under the action plan in 2014, which continue to be rolled out this year, are available on my Department’s website. The current plan includes some €26 million of measures across a range of Departments and agencies that will provide diverse supports for disadvantaged communities. The planned expenditure for 2015 will support a range of measures, including emergency support services training and other supports for vulnerable and disadvantaged young people, and health-related supports to assist young people with disabilities, as well as other community-based initiatives. To give effect to the plan, there is a total allocation in excess of €18 million in the Estimates for 2015 across seven Departments. That includes almost €6 million for measures under my Department. Under the plan, Pobal will administer new measures on behalf of my Department that will promote social enterprise and innovation, both urban and rural, and youth employment, employability and entrepreneurship in disadvantaged areas. Applications will be open to eligible community and voluntary sector organisations, local development companies and statutory and other public agencies from 1 July next with a closing date of 22 July. Pobal also administers new training and support services for home carers on behalf of the Department of Social Protection and a range of measures on behalf of the Department of Health. Applications under these measures can also be made during the same period by eligible community and voluntary sector organisations, local development companies and statutory and other public agencies. As part of the support for these new measures, Pobal will hold a series of four regional pre-application information meetings which will take place later this month. Full details on each of the measures, the online application process, and how to register for the pre-application meetings are available on Pobal’s website.

If one looks at cash expenditure, then a total of €18 million will be unspent. For some reason the Government is holding onto the money. My understanding is that excluding the statutory reserve required to reunite people with dormant accounts, as the Minister of State put it, more than €100 million in the Dormant Accounts Fund is not being released for the purposes for which it was collected from the banks. Perhaps the Minister of State would confirm the figure on the record of the House? Why is the money being held and why are we not using it for the intended purposes? I will give the Minister of State two examples. Could she explain why the Government ceased the operation of the scheme we had in place for RAPID areas, whereby we allocated €100,000 every year for small programmes in the most disadvantaged areas in the country.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	I thank the Deputy.

#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	The net value of uncommitted funds is currently €141.28 million. As the Deputy well knows, people sometimes view dormant accounts as free money or as some type of slush fund but that is far from the case.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	Well said.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	As the Deputy well knows, there are accounting procedures governing dormant accounts funding. He knows also that the moneys must be included in the Vote and must be included in the Estimates, and that is how we arrive at the money we can commit from the Dormant Accounts Fund. A complex accounting procedure is involved. I assure the Deputy that where moneys can be spent, they will be spent. However, he must be mindful of the requirements under the legislation for me to provide a report to the Government on the operation of the fund during the preceding year. I will do that before the end of June. We are subject to regulatory requirements in the same way as every other Government organisation.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	When the Minister of State goes back to the Department she should ask the officials whether the previous Government spent the money, and if that was done in an open, fair and transparent way, and to the benefit of people. I will mention two programmes which the Minister of State could institute immediately. One is to give the money to the RAPID area implementation team, which would ensure there is no ministerial interference, to fund small projects in communities in the most deprived areas. The sum of €100,000 could be allocated between the 41 communities. The second programme we operated was a scheme which provided matching finance to either philanthropic or community funds, in particular to disability organisations for capital projects. That resulted in the provision of many very good facilities for people with disabilities. Would the Minister of State consider opening the fund for that purpose? I know the challenges involved in the operation of the fund. They do not justify sitting on €142 million. The statutory reserve more than covers the risk of anyone who comes looking for his or her money. The Minister of State has still not explained why we are sitting on €142 million that could do so much for ordinary people around the country who suffer social and economic disadvantage, educational disadvantage and those in the disability sector.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I am sorry but we are over time.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I assure the Deputy that if I was sitting on more than €100 million and I could get my hands on it for disadvantaged communities and youth unemployment, I would do so. The programme is in place and there are commitments in that regard in the Votes. The process is governed by accounting procedures. It is not a slush fund. I accept the point the Deputy made about RAPID areas. The other area to which he probably wished to refer is to CLÁR areas. Those programmes were good. I am due to answer a question on the RAPID programme and if the Deputy wishes I can supply him with the response also. I also refer him to the Pobal website which contains much information and some of the answers he sought.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	Many issues surround the proposal that is the construct and funding model of Irish Water which is before EUROSTAT at present. Its approval, or otherwise, will generate Irish Water's direction, duty and obligation to the public and also determine the suitability of proposals by the Government on the possibility of it putting its hands into the pay packets of many throughout the country on foot of non-payment. Could the Minister provide an update and a timeline on the proposal before EUROSTAT and indicate when we can expect a response and seek resolutions thereafter?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	A key component of the strategy to establish Irish Water is that Irish Water will be classified as a market corporation under EUROSTAT rules and as a result, will not, other than in respect of Government support, be included in the calculation of the general Government balance. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, an independent body, is responsible for engagement with EUROSTAT on such matters, and my Department has engaged with that office and has provided the necessary information to facilitate its work. The CSO has confirmed that it has submitted a classification proposal on Irish Water to EUROSTAT and that the proposal envisages Irish Water being classified outside the general Government sector. The CSO has further stated that this is a closed process and that it is awaiting the final adjudication by EUROSTAT. I genuinely cannot give the Deputy a date, although I would expect an outcome in a couple of months. It is a closed process and it is a matter for the CSO to make the announcement.  Pending a decision by EUROSTAT, for prudent forecasting reasons, the spring economic statement and accompanying documents are based on Irish Water being in Government. In the draft of Ireland’s stability programme: April 2015 update, table nine outlines the impact of Irish Water being included in Government on debt and deficit forecast, in order to be prudent. By 2020, the Irish Water debt, based on its capital investment proposals, would amount to just under 1% of Government debt if it was classified in Government. However, we expect it to be off balance sheet. The Government is confident that the underlying funding model for Irish Water supports increased investment in the water sector through an off-balance sheet classification of the utility, while at the same time providing for water charges which are affordable, clear and certain. The decision is ultimately a matter for EUROSTAT.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I thank the Minister for his response. I had thought the Taoiseach, if not the Minister, had informed the House some months ago that the delay in the CSO proposal to EUROSTAT meant any decision by EUROSTAT would not be forthcoming until June. Now the Minister is saying it will be June at the earliest and may be some months thereafter. Can he confirm to the House that for a €300 million loan Irish Water has taken out in the marketplace, it is paying 150% more than the NTMA is currently paying on behalf of the Government? I believe that, while the Government may be borrowing at 1%, Irish Water may be borrowing at 2.5%. That would seem to defeat the purpose of the mechanism by which the construct was put in place in the first instance, in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. Ultimately, the cost will be borne by those who avail of the water services.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	The dates and timing of this are really a matter for EUROSTAT. I do not have a date as it is not for me to decide, and I would not like to deflect from the independence of either the CSO or EUROSTAT. When they make their decision is a matter for them. The interest rate would reflect the time at which the loan was taken out and the terms and conditions of that time. I will get that information for the Deputy and forward it on to him. A different rate would not be abnormal.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I thank the Minister for his response and look forward to him providing that information. I again ask if he would find it strange, to say the least, if Irish Water is paying 150% more than the Government for funds on the open market? That would represent a contradiction in terms for the whole construct and purpose of Irish Water, and would work against the Government's purpose of taking it off balance sheet in order for it to be less of a burden on the taxpayer when it would be 150% more of a burden.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	Pending clarification, the one thing I will say is that when a loan is taken out, circumstances are obviously different. One could apply this to many different models, depending on when funding was taken out. The circumstances in every case are completely different. I would not find it strange that there are different percentages. The information will be provided to the Deputy in due course.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	The Deputy who tabled Question No. 9 is not present.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	This is simply to find out why there is such delay in the updated planning guidelines on wind farms.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	In December 2013, my Department published proposed draft revisions to the noise, setbacks and shadow flicker aspects of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines. These draft revisions proposed the setting of a more stringent day and night noise limit of 40 decibels for future wind energy developments; a mandatory minimum setback of 500 m between a wind turbine and the nearest dwelling for amenity considerations; and the complete elimination of shadow flicker between wind turbines and neighbouring dwellings. The public consultation process was initiated on these proposed draft revisions to the guidelines, which ran until 21 February 2014. My Department received submissions from over 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this public consultation process, which was one of the largest ever.  It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 wind energy development guidelines will be finalised very soon. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the wind guidelines. That technical work is currently being concluded and is quite technical, as the Deputy will appreciate. The revisions to the wind energy development guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Pleanála must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions under the planning Acts. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I was one of those who made a submission. The very fact there was this level of interest shows that people wanted ground rules before there was to be large and industrial-scale wind farms, for which there are already applications in place. Part of the reason people made submissions was to ensure there was a basis and yet major applications have gone in. One application, for example, straddling a number of counties, including County Kildare, has gone to An Bord Pleanála under strategic developments. I would have thought that if something was a strategic development, the Minister would actually set out a basis for it. The guidelines are the very least that should be required. I accept that the matter is complex, the Minister wants to get it right and there are technical matters. The problem is that events are overtaking us in terms of planning applications and there is extreme urgency in getting this concluded.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I take on board the Deputy's comments. I cannot comment on an individual application, as she will appreciate, although I accept that there is a need to bring in the guidelines very quickly and that there is a need for clarity. I am well aware of the volume of applications across the country and these guidelines are necessary. It is one of the largest projects in terms of guidelines that our Department has ever undertaken, given the volume of submissions. I would also stress that it is quite technical. We cannot approach it in a one-size-fits-all manner. To facilitate good planning, we must ensure that the guidelines reflect all necessary variables and that they reflect all the issues across the country from a planning perspective. I stress again that the technical appendices to the guidelines will also be quite thorough.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	Could the Minister give us an estimate of when he thinks the guidelines will be concluded and published?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I will allow Deputy Stanley to ask a quick supplementary question.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The Minister replied that it will be very soon. The point I want to raise concerns the 500 m statutory guideline he is bringing in. I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, on this two weeks ago. My point is that the set-back distance should be governed by the height of the turbines. A distance of 500 m is fine if it is a small turbine but there is a problem if it is a very large one, like those in the midlands where there is a specific problem in Laois and Offaly and the height of turbines can be 180 m.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	To answer Deputy Stanley, obviously, we are taking cognisance of all of that and I can assure him it will be dealt with as part of the guidelines. In response to Deputy Murphy, I expect to have this concluded before the summer recess, if not earlier.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	As the Deputy is not present, Question No. 11 cannot be taken.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The most serious crisis facing this country is the lack of affordable and social housing for people. The Government committed to delivering 15,800 social housing units this year. Can the Minister of State tell us if we are anywhere even close to those figures? Certainly, going on the experience of what is happening in Dún Laoghaire, where there will be a total of five this year, if that is indicative of what is happening in the rest of the country, these targets are a complete sham.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I thank the Deputy for the question. To correct the record, what the Deputy is referring to is just phase 1 of the local authority allocations which were announced a few weeks ago. I have already stated in the House to the Deputy that further phases of allocations will be made very shortly. The capital acquisitions scheme which will provide funding to voluntary housing bodies in association with local authorities will be announced jointly by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and myself very shortly, and a further phase of local authority housing allocations will be announced in the coming months. This is all based on the proposals coming from the local authorities, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, on the priorities they have identified to address the housing challenges in their particular areas. With specific reference to the question on Part V, the proposed legislative changes to Part V provisions have been set out in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill 2015, which will be debated here in the coming days. In future, the focus of Part V will be on the delivery of completed social housing units, with a requirement for up to 10% social housing in developments of ten or more units. The Bill also proposes a more concerted focus on the delivery of completed Part V units, with other options, such as the making of cash payments instead, being discontinued. I believe the Deputy will welcome this. While my Department does not have details on the exact number of social housing units to be delivered under Part V in future years, as this is dependent on the number of house construction projects that are commenced, it is estimated that, nationally, in the region of 4,000 additional social housing units will be delivered by 2020 under the revised Part V provisions, using a range of delivery options. I am committed to the principle of a social housing gain from private development and I believe the Part V mechanism has the potential to be a significant contributor to social housing in the context of a recovering housing market. On 5 May last, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and I announced a €312 million social housing construction investment programme, with over 1,700 housing units to be built in 100 separate projects across all 31 local authority areas in the period up to the end of 2017. Based on the information supplied by the local authorities, 32 of these projects already have Part VIII planning approval, so they are shovel-ready and under way. The announcement on 5 May was only the first phase of a new social housing building programme and further projects will be announced in the coming weeks.

As the Minister of State rightly said, the reason he cannot give us figures and the reason those houses are not being delivered is that it is dependent on construction in the private sector. That is the problem, is it not? That is why were not getting the delivery. In Dún Laoghaire, against a target of 681 units, HAP has this year delivered none; the figure for those built or acquired is none; for leasing, none; for voids, one; and for RAS, four. It is not happening, and this is because 85% of the target for this year is dependent on the private sector, which is a total mirage, is it not? The Department is not going to get anywhere even close to the target it has set for this year because it is depending on the private sector to deliver the units.

However, as I indicated in reply to Deputy Cowen on an earlier question, there are now very strong signs of recovery in the housing market, given the number of housing projects getting off the ground and the number of commencements and planning permissions going through. Even if we were to pursue the Deputy's solution, which is the direct build of local authority houses alone, there would still be a timelag in providing those units. What the Department has had to do is look across a wide range of measures to respond to this housing challenge. First, we looked at the voids and vacant housing stock which were unacceptably lying vacant. These are existing local authority houses in local authorities across the country. We have ring-fenced funding and provided allocations to local authorities, and we have asked them to prioritise this and to turn units around efficiently so they are put back to beneficial use as quickly as possible. Additional funding was provided to local authorities for this. Some 2,000 units were turned around last year and another 1,000 vacant units will be provided this year. We are also providing funds for direct acquisition to local authorities and voluntary housing bodies so they can buy houses in the interim period before the new projects are built. We have green-lighted the shovel-ready projects the Deputy is speaking about and we have provided the funding to the local authorities. We cannot magic up more projects if the local authorities are not coming forward with them. In the meantime, we are making other provisions, such as the Part V provision. In the past five years, Part V has delivered literally nil units because private construction was not happening but we are now beginning to see it happening. We are removing the ability of people to substitute with cash. We will deliver units under this scheme and we are using every mechanism available to us because it is a priority for this Government.

However, based on the Minister's own letter, 85% of what was promised this year is dependent on the private sector - 3,000 from leasing and 8,400 from HAP. It is not happening and it is not going to happen. The landlords are not interested in getting involved in this and the construction is not happening on the level that is needed. The Government's entire social housing policy is predicated on getting stuff from the private sector. Can I point out something else?

#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	Yesterday I commented on some of the stand-out provisions of the Bill, such as section 7, which concerns registered employment agreements and instructs the Labour Court to register agreements only where there is all-party agreement and in cases in which the court is satisfied that a trade union is substantially representative of workers in an organisation. On the other side, section 18, which concerns sectoral employment orders, will extend advantageous benefits and conditions to workers in a sector even if they or their employer were not party to Labour Court proceedings. Section 20 of the Bill is also significant because it provides a mechanism to allow a business owner or employer to apply to the Labour Court for a temporary derogation from the requirement concerning pay levels set out in the sectoral employment order. This, it must be pointed out, is for businesses experiencing temporary financial difficulties. It is important that businesses experiencing difficulties have options regarding sectoral employment orders, and this is an issue I raised at the Oireachtas committee. It provides flexibility. In times of financial difficulty for a business, when jobs are under threat, we should not put in place a system that would compound this threat. Section 20 will enable business owners and employees to work together to save the business and bring it back to viability. An example would be everyone in the business taking a small cut rather than allowing a colleague to be let go. This is the type of flexibility we need to ensure job creation and job retention.  In terms of the benefits of the Bill for workers, it will ensure that where there is no collective bargaining, workers will have an effective system that will allow them to air grievances about pay or conditions of employment in the Labour Court. For employers, the Bill will provide a clear and balanced mechanism in which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place. I again commend the Minister of State on the work he has done on this Bill. I wish him well in its passage through the House.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	It has been predicted that in 2015 we could see one of the highest levels of workplace stoppages since pre-recession times. Disputes in the transport, education and retail sectors alone will bring to more than 65,000 the number of days lost this year to work stoppages. This compares to 33,748 between 2010 and 2013, according to CSO figures. The high levels of disaffection do not come as a surprise to many of us. One in five workers now earns less than the living wage of €11.45 per hour, a level of income on which it is impossible to make ends meet in modern Ireland, something that has been accepted by agencies in Ireland and Europe. We currently have the weakest legal protection for bargaining in the Western world. Hence, the broad aim of the Bill - that is, to provide an improved framework for workers who seek to enhance their working conditions of employment where collective bargaining is not recognised by their employer - is commendable. As the economic recovery continues, as we are told it will, it is important that the right to collective bargaining is in place and that employees who seek improvements in pay and conditions are not victimised for doing so. However, I am greatly disappointed that the proposals fall short of statutory union recognition. From my interpretation of the Bill and those who have read it with me, I understand it does not require employers to engage in collective bargaining. Rather, it provides a framework through which employers who fail to do so may be brought before the Labour Court by trade unions. I am also confused - perhaps the Minister of State could offer an explanation - as to where the term "voluntary engagements" in the definition of collective bargaining came from. I remind him that I am currently dealing with FÁS supervisors in Waterford who won their case in the Labour Court but still have not been paid. They have been told that because the money is not available they cannot be paid. Therefore, going to the Labour Court does not necessarily mean that one's rights are vindicated. I welcome the fact that the determination of the Labour Court may be enforced by the Circuit Court if an employer refuses to engage. I ask the Minister of Sate to clarify that when the Labour Court makes a recommendation that is not upheld, such as in the case of the FÁS workers I mentioned, workers can go to the Circuit Court.  I acknowledge the enhanced protections against victimisation by employers of workers who invoke their rights under the new legislation. However, my interpretation of the Bill, together with some people in the trade union movement, is that it is disappointing that the Bill does not apply where the number of workers party to the trade dispute is considered insufficient, having regard to the total number of workers employed by the employer. If that is correct, it immediately removes the recognition of collective bargaining as a fundamental right, as it is under international and European law, if the numbers are considered too small. Why should a worker be discriminated against just because he or she is in a minority in their workplace? It is a very important part of the Bill and needs to be reconsidered and perhaps amended, unless I am misreading the Bill, which I do not think I am. The Bill was designed to provide significant strengthening of laws to protect and promote workers' rights and the low-paid. However, it fails completely to recognise the plight of workers on zero or minimum-hour contracts with no hope of the economic stability that is necessary to build a future for themselves or their families. Many of us have spoken about the plight of the Dunnes Stores workers, but this problem is not confined to one company. I was recently contacted by a constituent in Waterford who works for Penneys and was recruited on a 11.5 hour contract. At the time, she made it clear that she was available for work seven days a week in the hope of getting full-time employment. In reality, her average working week is four-hour shifts spread over four days, and because of the way the hours are spread out she cannot claim jobseeker's allowance. Her average weekly take-home pay is €169, and last week she came home with €124. That is slave labour and it is an issue that is not being dealt with. It is the essence of the problem here, where many workers are on the minimum wage or below or have zero-hour contracts. They are the people we should be trying to help in this Bill. The company to which I referred continues to recruit staff in Waterford while at least 30 of its workers are on these contracts and available to work full-time. It does not make any sense at all when we are discussing a living wage and respectable conditions for employees. I know the woman I mentioned and she is living in poverty. There is no way that somebody who wants to work full-time - who has work available but cannot avail of it because the employer wants to keep him or her on a minimum hour or zero-hour contract - should be living without a decent quality of life. It is demeaning and demoralising for people who want to work hard, and the Bill fails completely to deal with the many such workers.  In Frederick Court, which is run by the HSE and the Government, four women have had their hours cut back to six hours a week in the past couple of weeks. Their wages have been cut dramatically. We now have workers on contracts of 1.5 hours a day facing cuts. Where in the Bill is provision made for the workers who most need to be protected? This is very important because it applies to workers everywhere, including those in the public service and the private sector.  We do not know what will happen in years to come as we privatise contracts in hospitals and so on. Private contractors are contracted under the lowest possible amount of money; therefore, wages have to be cut.Their contracts could be up in two years while another contractor could come in and do the same work. There are thousands of workers across the country feeling this way. Over 16% of employees are estimated to be living below the poverty line. The pattern of recovery in wages is uneven across sectors and occupations, not to mention the precarious work contracts and conditions. This, coupled with cuts and a tightening of eligibility conditions in social welfare along with increases in taxation, have increased poverty even further to the extent that the think tank, TASC, is warning that inequality in Ireland will edge closer to US levels unless there are changes in economic and social policy. I would go further. If this country does not dramatically, not to mention urgently, rethink its stance on employment rights and the rights of workers to secure employment, a liveable wage and defined hours, we are heading for income inequality that will have catastrophic implications for future generations. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, means well for workers and has met the Dunnes Stores workers. While not a criticism of him, this Bill may have been different if the Labour Party was not in coalition with Fine Gael. However, we should address how those workers on zero-hour contracts and similar contracts are treated. It is appalling and degrading for them. I have workers telling me they want to work 40 hours a week full-time but do not want to be on social welfare. I gave the Minister of State the example of a worker in Penneys coming home with less than what they would get from social welfare. There is something fundamentally wrong with a system where a worker can earn €125 for working a week spread over four days but cannot claim social welfare. Those are the workers that need the most protection. The Bill is commendable in many areas. For the first time, legislation is being introduced which would protect workers in some ways. However, it has failed and is a missed opportunity to deal with workers on low incomes and zero-hour contracts.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015. I also welcome the debate on this Bill. While there are more measures I would like to have seen in this legislation, as an Independent Member I will always look at each Bill in the context of how it is presented in the Dáil and in broader society to decide on its merits. If I believe it is good for workers or for the people, I will support it. The bottom line is I will be supporting this legislation. I commend the Minister of State on his work in this whole area. The bottom line for me is that it is sensible legislation, protecting the rights of workers in difficult and harsh economic times and in which some employers are hostile to their rights. For too long, Irish workers have been pushed around and exploited. We have to stand up to protect them. Last Saturday, I attended the protest against Dunnes Stores and I support the Mandate workers on the zero-hour contracts issue. People need to wake up and support these workers as many of them are our neighbours, friends and families. I also welcomed last week the Minister of State’s strong support for these workers. It is important the Minister of State responsible for labour issues goes on the record to support workers in such cases. I know from talking to many of the staff on the ground, many of them friends of mine, that they really appreciated the Minister of State’s stance. It is important this issue is not politicised in a party political way. If people are exploited, they should be supported, regardless of their political background as it is a justice and equality issue. I speak as a former branch secretary in the INTO, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, and a delegate to the Dublin Council of Trade Unions for many years. I have had strong contact with many of those who will be affected by today’s legislation over the past 20 years. We also know the reality of modern Irish society. Reform will come slowly and concessions will have to be given. The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, as presented, is progressive legislation. I accept it is difficult for the Minister of State. As Deputy Halligan said, one does not always get everything one wants in coalition. At the same time, I accept this is a positive development in the industrial relations field. When one digs down deeper into the legislation, one sees the Bill aims to reform the system of registered employment agreements and provides for a process of registering employment agreements on an individual enterprise basis but also on a sectoral basis. The Bill will also introduce reforms on the right to engage in collective bargaining. It will amend the procedure under which trade disputes are brought before the Labour Court in circumstances where collective bargaining is not practised. The bigger picture is often missed by many of our colleagues, however. This Bill is also part of a package of employment legislation to counteract the weaknesses in existing employment legislation. These include the minimum wage (amendment) (low pay commission) Bill and Workplace Relations Bill 2015. The reality is that there has been a marked increase in industrial disputes between 2014 and 2015. In the first quarter of 2014, there were just two disputes involving 178 workers, resulting in 310 working days lost. However, in one year, this has increased with disputes involving 27,588 workers and 24,056 working days lost. This attempt at reform and the protection of workers is positive. Outside of legislation, if one looks at good practices in SMEs, small and medium-sized enterprises, where workers are treated with respect and given a decent wage, productivity is usually high. I have many friends who employ between three and 15 people in SMEs. They have close relationships with their staff and pay them well. They get it back in productivity and growth in their businesses. Employers need to cop on and listen to what is going on with labour legislation such as this Bill. They should not see it as a threat against their businesses as some of them seem to do. There are ultra, right-wing conservatives on top of some businesses who do not seem to get this. It will cause them more grief in the end. They need to open their minds. Even if they do not like trade unions or do not want to negotiate with their workers, the bottom line is they will increase productivity and growth if they do. It is also important to broaden this debate to include the public sector. We have seen the hammering public servants have taken over the past eight years from right-wing conservatives who present themselves as commentators without any electoral mandate. I will remind them that over the past several years, public servants have implemented many workplace reforms. Productivity has been boosted by additional workplace hours. There are new shared services and the redeployment of staff.They have had a 10% reduction in their numbers and their sick pay and annual paid leave were reformed. There was average benchmarking between 2002 and 2006 of 8.9% and this was wiped out with pay cuts. There was no benchmarking award in 2007. Many public servants have delivered reforms and shared services despite 10% cuts. It is important we say this during the debate. To return to the legislation, it is important that we focus on the low paid workers whom Deputy Halligan mentioned. The grave injustice they face is a new issue in Irish society. They are caught between deciding whether to take a low paid job or stay on social welfare whereby they know they will be able to put food on their table. Families are getting caught in the poverty trap. It is sad that in 2015 some 138,000 children live in poverty and the number in consistent poverty has increased from 6.8% to 11.7%. People such as Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, is concerned that 37,000 children will be living in poverty in 2020. At present, 1,054 children are homeless. We need to target resources to these people. I jump up and down here speaking about children in poverty, but the figure of 138,000 can be tackled. It is not out of control. If we could focus employment and social welfare resources to target these people first, we could then move on to deal with the other injustices in society. We need a clear strategy. We hear debates on the radio about Independents speaking together. When we do so, we speak about poverty, protecting the rights of workers, educational disadvantage and services for people with disabilities. We can work very closely together on these issues, even though we might come from very different backgrounds. The bottom line is we are big and bold enough to sit down and hammer out real issues on which we can agree. I hear smart alec commentators stating it is not a cohesive group, but when it comes to come serious issues such as unemployment, low pay, poverty, disabilities and education we have a group of Independent Deputies who will roll up their sleeves and get stuck in. This is why people are looking in our direction for the formation of a Government. As we all know, we must get elected first and this is what is most important. The legislation is positive. The Minister of State will probably die of shock, but I commend him on the work he has done on it. As an Independent Deputy in opposition, if somebody in government does something progressive we should support it and I welcome it.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. I warmly welcome the tremendous work done on the legislation by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, and I compliment him on it. The legislation will allow for collective bargaining in the workplace and for sectoral registered employment agreements to be re-established. I listened with some disbelief and bemusement to some of the utterances of some politicians, particularly in Fianna Fáil, who bemoaned the fact that the legislation is just a repair job. With regard to Dunnes Stores, they exhorted that the legislation be implemented immediately. They must have fallen asleep because I remember the Supreme Court's decision on Ryanair in 2007 which cast doubt on the functionality of the Acts and had a significant and chilling effect on their use subsequently. Now they pretend this is not a significant advancement. Of course we are circumscribed by the constitutional provisions, and I agree with Deputy Halligan as I would also like to see this as a constitutional right, but it is not the case now. The Bill is a significant step along the way. My roots go back to the very beginning when my late grandmother was involved in the Lock-out, so I will not take lectures from people who do not have these leanings. Every Labour Party member and public representative would certainly go further and Deputy Halligan acknowledged this. Notwithstanding the ample opportunities other parties in the House had to deal with this, they singularly failed to do so. It is appropriate that the Labour Party has availed of its opportunity of being part of the Government to rectify what has been long sought by our activists and trade union colleagues. When implemented, the Bill will give some industrial muscle and strength to workers, such as the Dunnes Stores workers, and ensure such a situation is unlikely to recur. The Labour Court would be able to investigate a dispute and all the relevant factors and surrounding circumstances. We have thousands of tremendously good employers. Small employers always obey the rules and regulations. Legislation is like a big umbrella which catches the unfortunate small people doing their best who are struggling and who have good communication with workers. It will also catch the big employers. If an employer fails to participate or recognise the recommendations, the outcome can be subject to judicial supervision by way of a Circuit Court application to have the recommendation enforced. I anticipate that when a matter goes to the Circuit Court it would award costs against recalcitrant employers. This is what should be done. Recalcitrant employers should pay the cost of the worker having to go to the Circuit Court. Many of them have deep pockets, and a costs order which could be subsequently enforced would have a sobering effect and might bring them to the implementation table much quicker. We have met Dunnes Stores workers in Mullingar and everywhere else and we have marched with them. We have noted their plight. I hope the legislation will provide some remedy and respite for them. Dr. de Buitléir has examined the minimum wage and measures will be brought forward on this. The University of Limerick has examined zero hour and variable hours contracts. How can one plan with any certainty under such a contract? I agree with Deputy Halligan in this regard. How does one pay a mortgage or for child care, a car or other such costs if an employer can, when one has a number of years' service, cut one's hours from 19 to 14 to ten and bring in somebody at the lower end to replace one? This must be nailed. Workers in Dunnes Stores and other firms are looking for fair pay, decent wages and reliable hours which are not changed or altered at the whim of the employer. We must tackle the issue of zero hours contracts and variable contracts because of the lack of certainty. We should not forget that appropriate legislative amendments to the industrial relations legislation of 2001 and 2004 were a commitment in the programme for Government drawn up in March 2011 to reform the law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining and ensure the State complies with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in this regard. The new legislation will be of benefit to employers and employees as it will bring some degree of certainty to the industrial landscape and will assist in preventing a race to the bottom in terms of pay, conditions, employment and skills. I know from his background this is something which motivates the Minister of State and brought him into politics. Collective bargaining and fair conditions of employment go hand in hand. The right to join a union and bargain collectively for fair pay and fair conditions of employment is critical for a fair workplace as it is the only way to ensure employees have equal bargaining power with the employer. The right to collective bargaining is essential so working men and women have the strength to improve their living standards, provide for their families and build a strong foundation for our economy. The trade union movement has repeatedly stated that workers are not commodities to be bought and sold. They make a very productive input. My uncle always said nobody ever made money on the back of the bricks and mortar, it was always on the back of the workers. It is the sweat on the brow of the workers which is productive and creates extra output and profits. This is why it is important we ensure their rights are recognised. The right to collective bargaining through a trade union is a human right, recognised in human rights and European treaties. I have heard about other human rights, but this is definitely a human right. Every human rights system recognises workers' rights to unionise and take appropriate action to protect their interests. One has only to look at Article 23.4 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Articles 27, 28 and 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.We signed up to recognise these human rights standards but the law has not been adequate to protect employees, whence the necessity for this legislation. I am very proud that the Labour Party was instrumental in bringing this forward. The International Labour Organization has expressed serious concern that Ireland's laws and practices are inadequate and violate of Articles 87 and 88 of the said convention relating to freedom of association and the right to organise and participate in collective bargaining. It recommended that we amend our laws to bring them into line with the fundamental convention requirements and that is what is being done. Ireland lags significantly behind other industrialised European countries in respect of providing workers with collective bargaining rights, recognition of a union and the acceptance of negotiation on a collective agreement being an essential element in asserting those rights. In the Wilson case, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that governments needed to ensure that the right to unionise is respected by employers, including by prohibiting coercive practices such as offering inducements or more favourable treatment if workers do not exercise their union rights, or using other means to attempt to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees at any stage in the exercise of their trade union rights. It is important, therefore, that there is a focus on outlawing less favourable treatment, victimisation or other penalisation. There are myriad ways of victimising workers and I would like the Minister to look at them as they need to be prohibited. These include refusing to hire somebody because he or she exercises his or her human right to join a union and seek to collectively bargain and keeping a blacklist of workers who support the union, which is particularly unacceptable. Refusing to allow the union representative to meet with the workforce to discuss and prepare a collective bargaining request is an unfair practice as is the refusal to provide workers with any information.  To collectively bargain, workers need a back-up and hands-on help from the union. It is not acceptable for management to hold meetings to caution against joining the union or seeking to collectively bargain to protect and improve pay and conditions, or for management to threaten to move operations if workers exercise their human right to collectively bargain through a trade union. Disciplining, penalising, harassing, transferring or making a worker subject to any less favourable treatment because they support the union also comes into this category, as does favouring employees who do not support the union over those who do when it comes to promotions, hours, the enforcement of rules or anything else. Similar actions include penalising workers who take action in support of securing a collective agreement, taking away benefits or privileges in order to discourage people from seeking to collectively bargain through a trade union or promising employees a pay increase, promotion or special favour if they oppose the union. I am sure Deputy Halligan would agree that is a fair collection of inducements and forms of victimisation.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 also provides for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between an employer or employers and trade unions, covering remuneration and conditions of employment in individual enterprises. It also puts in place a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration, terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers. It is in effect a framework to replace the former sectoral registered agreements and this is contained within Part 2 of the Bill. I listened to the speech of Deputy Tóibín yesterday and he did not seem to acknowledge the progress that this legislation will mean. We would of course like a constitutional change but that will take some time. Deputy Finian McGrath spoke about the potential for a wide range of Independents in the next Dáil and it will be interesting to see if they will bring forward something such as this. It is something a re-established Constitutional Convention might examine and I await progress in that area. This, however, is progress and it is churlish not to acknowledge that. A lot of people may wish to downplay the role of the Labour Party in bringing forward this long sought after legislation. The legislation must, of course, pass the constitutional test. We are prohibited from introducing legislation that is not in conformity with the Constitution but this legislation conforms with it and it achieves significant progress. In McGowan and others v. the Labour Court, Ireland and the Attorney General, the Supreme Court held that Part 3 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 had regard to Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution which vested in the Oireachtas the exclusive power to make laws, which cannot be allocated to other bodies or individuals. That is why this legislation has been brought forward in this format. We ended up in a serious situation in which the registration of employment agreements were declared invalid, meaning the Labour Court no longer had jurisdiction to enforce or apply them. In effect, all enterprise level REAs that had been registered by the Labour Court - over 50 of them - were invalid, notwithstanding the fact that they were not the subject of the Supreme Court decision. This led to significant uncertainty and there was angst and some disputes, especially in construction-related areas. The restoration of REAs and sectoral employment orders will provide a mechanism whereby the existence of legally binding terms and conditions of employment relating to rates or remuneration, sick pay, pension, etc. will be examined and this will promote harmonious relations between workers and employers. Ultimately, employers should look at this as something of benefit to them as it provides tramlines within which industrial relations can be conducted. The Labour Court will, in respect of SEOs, initiate a review of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister. The Labour Court will, under the legislation, have principles to take into account in helping to make its decision. A derogation will be allowed for employers from SEOs under specified circumstances. The proposals which were approved by the Government and published in May respect Ireland's voluntary industrial relations system but ensure that where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, either with a trade union or an internally accepted body, the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there are effective means for a union on behalf of the members in that employment to have disputed remuneration terms and conditions assessed against relevant comparators. That is important because very often it was a lack of knowledge that made both sides somewhat wary. It also ensures that if an employer chooses to collectively bargain with an internally accepted body, as opposed to a union, that body must pass the test of its independence, because it is extremely important that it is not just a cover or a front for the employer. I believe, however, that the most appropriate body with which to conduct industrial relations is a union. There is a provision to ensure that cases dealt with are those where the number of workers is not insignificant and that elements of remuneration conditions have to be looked at in the context of the totality of remuneration conditions. There is also provision to manage the frequency of the reassessment of like issues. It is important we have a detailed definition of what constitutes collective bargaining and accepted bodies, bringing clarity to the requirements to be met by the trade unions in advancing a claim. It also sets out the principles and conditions for the Labour Court to follow when assessing workers' terms and conditions and contains provisions to ensure that they are looked at in their totality. There is enhanced protection for workers who may feel they are being victimised for exercising their rights in the form of interim relief in the case of dismissal and that is important. This is a good start to remedy a lacuna in the legislation. I am proud of the role of the Labour Party in bringing it forward and I compliment the Minister.
#DerekNolan	unknown-#DerekNolan-party	unknown-#DerekNolan-dob	unknown-#DerekNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. It shows the implementation of the Labour Party agenda in government and in statute and the debate is very welcome. One of my most poignant moments in my job as a public representative occurred when I went down to the picket lines at the six Dunnes Stores outlets in Galway city a couple of weeks ago. I met the workers, primarily women, on the picket lines. It was not easy for them and there was not uniform support from customers or staff. Many of the people protesting and picketing were outside while there were people inside working. The divisions, the bitterness and the discord were notable. The decision they took was largely on behalf of other people.The people who are active in the unions were doing it for other people who are coming into Dunnes. They saw how the younger people working there had such precarious conditions and such volatile hours and so on. If we are to take anything from that, we should realise that when people engage in an industrial dispute, they do not do so lightly. They do so when there is something at stake, in an atmosphere which is not conducive to their own progress at work and is often very harsh. They must be commended for what they did. They are aware that this legislation is going through this House. They know the need for it and it will make a big difference in those situations. The vast majority of employer-employee relationships work quite well. We do not hear about strikes or industrial disputes very often because most of the time employers and employees engage quite positively. Where employers refuse to acknowledge that their employees have a collective view on their working conditions and hours of work and refuse to engage with their employees, that is anathema to good industrial relations. It is bad business practice. This legislation will help to remedy that and put in place a structure that will allow those workers to see their rights vindicated. We need to take a step back. In the years to come, as the economy continues to recover, we must have a debate in this country about the kind of society we want to build. Will we just go back to where we were ten years ago, the era of light-touch regulation, of worshipping at the altar of the developer, of the quick buck, of the guy who manages to buy a site and sell it on, or do we build a society and an economy that rewards people who get up in the morning and contribute? The only thing we all have that is individual to ourselves is our day's work. Whether it is Bill Gates or someone working in Dunnes, all a person can do is get up in the morning and go to work. People should be rewarded and respected for contributing and we should not have this hierarchy of entitlement and worship in the economy based on people's roles. If we go down that road again, saying that the guys at the top need to be looked after and the people at the bottom have to watch themselves because if their wages go up a little we will lose the jobs, and so on - if we go down that road of a low-wage economy, where it is very good to be at the top and very bad to be at the bottom - we will sow a seed of real discontent and we will do people a disservice. The measures we are debating today, with the registered employment agreements, the collective bargaining, and the excellent work the Minister of State is doing on the Low Pay Commission, will ensure that everybody in society who gets up in the morning, goes to work and contributes will be respected and afforded the decency they deserve because they are contributing and doing their best. If we keep that message at the heart of what we are doing and the decisions we make, and if we create an economy and a society that is based on people working and respecting them, we will have a far different trajectory from the one we followed in the boom years, when it was about whoever had the flashiest car, the biggest house, or whatever was admired. We need to realise that our society is broader than that and everyone must contribute and must be able to get by. I commend the Minister of State on his passion in pursuing this. He has been dogged in his determination to see it through. He has consulted widely and he has strengthened the Bill from its original version, putting in anti-victimisation measures and comparative measures that were not there before. All of those measures will go a long way towards creating that floor and that trajectory in our discussion about our economy and participation, which will see us finally moving in the direction in which we all want to move, namely, that of an economy that is people-focused and worker-focused.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I am sharing time with Deputy Naughten. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this important debate. I would like to voice my support for the general thrust of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015. The Bill will go some way towards strengthening our current legislation, and that is a starting block from which we can move towards the dismantling of zero-hour contracts, poor working conditions and victimisation of workers who wish to be represented by trade unions, as we saw in recent weeks. In February 1998, as enterprise, trade and employment spokesperson in the House, I introduced the first trade union recognition Bill on behalf of the labour and trade union movement. This followed lengthy consultations with trade union and employee representatives and was especially directed at assisting unionised workers in Ryanair, where chief executive Michael O'Leary refused to engage with his own workforce and its trade union representatives. I recall the bitter hostility to the proposal from some employers and in particular from US companies based in Ireland and from IDA Ireland acting on their behalf. A key mechanism in the 1998 Bill was subsequently adopted in the 2001 and 2004 Industrial Relations Acts and later attacked in the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Ryanair v. IMPACT. That brings us back to today's legislation. I welcome Chapter 2, which restores the legislative framework for REAs, and Chapter 3, which does the same for sectoral employment orders following a lacuna for many years in this area. In July 2011 the High Court found the JLC wage-setting mechanisms to be unconstitutional and struck down the employment regulation orders, EROs, which had applied under the Industrial Relations Act 1946. In 2013, in the John Grace Fried Chicken case, the Supreme Court further struck down Part III of the 1946 Act. Hopefully, these infirmities in earlier legislation have been fully rectified in sections 5 to 20 of this Bill and future court challenges regarding the constitutionality of Parts 2 and 3 will not occur. To have allowed our industrial relations machinery to exist without such legislation for a number of years was unacceptable, and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, has moved at last to restore this legislative bulwark for good industrial relations. I have some concerns regarding the provisions in section 7(3)(c) relating to REAs, whereby the trade union must be "substantially representative of the workers to whom the agreement relates". In section 14(1)(a)(i), relating to sectoral employment orders, there is a similar provision, whereby the trade union must be "substantially representative of the workers of the particular class, type or group in the economic sector". It will certainly now fall to the Labour Court to define these clauses on a case-by-case basis. I hope that significant groups of workers will not be disenfranchised by these sections in the actual operation of the Bill. Another big worry for workers and their representatives, as the Minister of State will have observed in the preparatory period of the Bill, is that there do not seem to be many compliance and enforcement provisions for Chapters 2 and 3 in the published Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State will return to these issues in his response to the debate and on Committee Stage. Part 3 will amend existing legislation, as mentioned earlier, in order to insert definitions of "collective bargaining" and "excepted body". The nub of Part 3 of the Bill is the provision of a better legal route for workers to go to the Labour Court for reviews of their salary, terms and conditions, which is very welcome. However, the Bill does not address the fundamental right to trade union recognition and representation, which I tried to address 17 years ago, in a forthright way, or the deplorable impact on workers of the 2007 Supreme Court judgment. Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights clearly protects freedom of association, which includes the right to bargain collectively. Article 28 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights also provides for the right of collective bargaining and collective action. I note, for example, that Michael Doherty of Maynooth University has expressed concern that the term "voluntary engagements", which the Minister of State has inserted into the definition of collective bargaining, may be open to wide interpretation and that Ireland has had, until now, perhaps the weakest legal protection for collective bargaining in much of the EU. Unite trade union has also expressed fears that the retention of the concept of "excepted body" in section 23 may allow companies to negotiate with their employees only through an employer-sponsored association or an employer-friendly company union. Like other speakers, I welcome section 35 of Part 3, which provides for the amendment of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 in order to protect persons who may be victimised or dismissed for being a member of the trade union. Only a few weeks ago we heard from Dunnes Stores workers in this very building about serious intimidation and victimisation of workers who stood up for their basic rights. It is disappointing to see that the opportunity has not been taken in this Bill to include, once and for all, the right to full recognition for trade unions. This is a missed opportunity. However, I welcome the small improvements the Minister of State has made in this Bill and I commend him on that work.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and the principle behind it. The important aspect of it is that it will provide certainty for employees in that they will know what their rates of pay will be and it will also provide certainty for employers. In the many sectors we are discussing, many employers tender for contracts. It is a competitive area and the provisions of the legislation level the playing pitch with respect to employers based in this jurisdiction competing for contracts in that when they tender for projects the rights, rates, conditions and terms of employment of their employees are not being squeezed. It also gives certainty to employers when they put in a price for a contract in that they know that the cost of their labour will be at a certain rate over the period of the contract. It is good from the point of view of employees and it also provides a level of certainty that is needed for employers when they tender for contracts in what is a very competitive market. If an employer can secure a long-term contract, it provides long-term security to their employees. However, some employers tendering for contracts are not covered by these agreements or this legislation because they are outside this jurisdiction or they may continue to use subcontractors. They may squeeze the price from subcontractors, cut their margins and put legitimate businesses on the road. I have a concern about that. Our tendering processes are very much to the letter of the law with regard to what must be included but there is very little flexibility in dealing with the needs in respect of that contract in terms of ensuring that certain conditions are complied with as part of the project. Therefore, price is king with respect to tendering here. Far more contracts in Ireland are successfully won by companies outside the country than in any other jurisdiction in the European Union. While that is partly due to the fact that we are a small economy and do not have the necessary expertise and skills in every area, another reason is that we only consider the price and do not consider other conditions. I will illustrate the point by giving the practical example of a sewerage contract involving the laying of sewer pipe. That is a pretty basic contract and there is not much room to cut corners. A contractor was awarded a sewerage contract in my constituency and untold problems arose while the works were ongoing. The contractor employed staff from outside this jurisdiction and they undercut legitimate employers and contractors locally who could not compete for it. It took years to resolve the problems created by that set of works and yet the next contract awarded by the local authority was given to the same contractor. The same problems arose again. That company eventually went to the wall. The local authority then had to follow up on the bond that was in place and eventually had to appoint another contractor to come in and fix the problem on the second contract. While local authorities might get caught once, there should not get caught again and again. A contractor who does shoddy work in one local authority area should not be able to move to another local authority area and create the same problems. There is a lack of joined up thinking across the board to ensure such cowboy contractors are identified. Such contractors either come back in another guise or move to another local authority area and secure contracts again.  There is also the matter of the impact of such projects in an area. I will use the example of water contracts again and this has been the experience across the board, although I have met people involved in tendering for work in the Department of Education and Skills, stationers and book suppliers across the country and they have all encountered the same problems. Irish Water is awarding contracts for water and sewerage mains works. Two of those contracts in County Galway, one in Oranmore and one in Ballinasloe, are causing problems. In both cases, it seems the issue is that has been a lack of discussion with local retailers. Sewer pipes and water mains are being laid through the business areas of those towns. There was a lack of engagement with the businesses and no conditions were attached to the contract to minimise traffic disruption or minimise the period that roads would be closed. Those should be basic, fundamental conditions attaching to a contract involving the laying of mains for the public water supply through a town centre or a retail area. Such works have a direct impact on ratepayers' ability to pay rates and pay their staff and it will end up that some of those businesses will go to the wall and more staff will be laid off as a result. We need to revisit that aspect when considering contractors tendering for projects. We need the provisions in this legislation and to consider not only the employees in these companies but the wider aspect of the direct impact such projects have on other employees in retail businesses in the towns. The second point I want to raise is in regard to correspondence I received from the ESB Retired Staff Association. It proposed that a meaningful mechanism be included in the legislation to provide that it can be part of negotiations that would take place. Where there is a collective agreement between employers and employees, in many cases it has a direct impact on pensions but pensioners and the widows of pensioners have no say in that regard. Changes in terms and conditions can have a substantial impact on them. We would all have dealt with cases involving pensioners, or the widows of pensioners, but mainly pensioners, where a deal has been negotiated between a trade union and an employer that has sold out on the pensioners. The trade union will focus on the rights of its existing employees who are paying their dues to the union, and the union cannot be blamed for doing that. However, the rights and entitlements of pensioners have been sacrificed to get a deal with the existing employees and that should not happen. They all need to be treated in an equitable manner. We are securing rights for employees in this legislation but we also need to provide for the pensioners. They have a fixed income and in some cases, it is tied in with the current rates which, hopefully, will keep their income in line with inflation. They do not have the ability to earn additional income. They plan their retirement based on that income. When cuts are imposed, as has happened in the case of retired employees in the public sector, it has an impact on their living standards and perhaps on their ability to service loans or mortgages that they have taken out on behalf of their sons or daughters.A mechanism needs to be created. The ESB Retired Staff Association has suggested that the definition of "worker" be changed to include former workers. I do not know how the Government can address this matter, but some recognition needs to be given to it in the legislation because their rights should not be undermined. The association also raised the issue of the Pensions Acts. Rather than including collective pensioner representation at the tail end of the process when there is a pension scheme deficit, it needs to be included at the front end. Regardless of whatever provision is made for retired workers in this legislation, they need to be included at an appropriate time, not after the agreement between the employer and employees has been signed and is already a fait accompli where people are only going through the formality of consulting pensioners with no intention of making a change even though there are direct implications for a company's retired employees. How to draft such a measure in legislation poses a challenge, but we should not sacrifice pensioners just to get a deal with existing employees. Mechanisms need to be established so as to ensure that it does not happen.

I welcome this Bill. The Labour Party is the party of work and it is correct that a Labour Party Minister of State would ensure good working conditions for people. I congratulate him on the work that he has done in this regard, which has been welcomed in the trade union movement. It is important the Bill progresses through the Houses as quickly as possible and is put into practice. It is also important that how the legislation works in practice is carefully examined so that any necessary change may be undertaken. I am sure the Minister of State will work on this issue. Deputy Naughten is leaving the House, but I would be interested in the Minister of State's response on the question of how the non-Irish companies that win contracts fit into the process as outlined in the Bill. In the world we live in, workers are under much greater pressure because it is easy for people to move from one jurisdiction to another. As such, it is important to ensure that people in this country have good working conditions, pay and so on. There are situations in which pay and conditions have been undermined. In some logistics companies, for example, lorry drivers who have been working for considerable lengths of time are on much better hourly rates than others who have joined, often from other countries. It is important there are equal conditions, given what is a growing problem not just in Ireland, but throughout the EU. It is also important we tackle issues like zero-hour contracts and the race to the bottom. In the Dunnes Stores dispute, for example, people are on low pay, have uncertain weekly hours, etc. In parenthesis, I would like to see major cuts in USC for low and middle-income workers in the next budget. However, I am happy to see high levels of USC for those on higher incomes. I understand from my conversations with the Minister of State that this Bill will help people like the Dunnes Stores workers who are dealing with companies that refuse to engage with trade unions and workers directly. The Bill's final provision addresses the question of vulnerability. It is important that this provision be implemented. The types of practice that we are seeing wreck people's lives in a number of ways. Family life is difficult if people are uncertain as to when and where they will be working. If income levels are uncertain, how can people provide themselves with accommodation? The Bill contributes towards an improvement in workers' rights. I welcome the fact registered employment agreements, REAs, will be reinstated. These will give groups of workers and employers covered by them greater certainty, including about pay and conditions, and strengthen the hand of trade unions in negotiating on behalf of those whom they represent. It is a pity the old system was overturned, but it is good it is being replaced. Turning to the sectoral employment order section of the Bill, this relates to trade unions, workers or organisations of employers requesting the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions relating to the pay and pensions of a class of workers and to make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. This is a welcome development. I note that there is a let-out clause in that employers can request temporary derogations. I hope that such derogations relate to important issues, for example, if a company is going through a bad financial patch and, therefore, cannot pay the correct amount at the time but will stick to the negotiated agreement as soon as it exits that bad patch. I welcome the amendment to the Unfair Dismissals Act relating to victimisation, which is a problem in the workforce from time to time. Before the whistleblower legislation and this Bill, whistleblowers were vulnerable. We saw it in the case of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the Garda. I am aware of one or two cases in which people lost their jobs because they stood up for what was right. It is correct that there be legislation to protect such people. I wish to say something to the Minister of State and whoever follows in his shoes: it is important that we try to-----

This was a stated Government policy. We learned as late as yesterday that a reported 50% of GPs have signed up for the under sixes contract. The figure is as low as 8% in County Tipperary. It stands at 32% in parts of Cork city and county. The figures for counties Clare and Louth are 29% and 22%, respectively. Large tracts of the country are to be left without access to GP services for under sixes under the new contract. While we did not oppose the Bill that made provision for the under sixes contract, we made the point from an early stage that primary care was simply being under-resourced and starved of funds and services. GP services are now beginning to fold across the country, which is an unsustainable position. At the same time, the Government is continuing to pretend that its stated primary care strategy, which involves investing in GP services, is the way forward in terms of maintaining people in the community and keeping them out of the acute hospital system. It may have escaped the notice of the Tánaiste that a couple of weeks ago, a 102 year old woman who had received a blood transfusion had to lie on a trolley in a corridor at the emergency department in Tallaght for over 24 hours.

There is huge uncertainty out there. Could we have some clarity? Will the Minister for Health and his colleagues re-engage with the doctors who are not signing these contracts? Will they engage with the National Association of General Practitioners, which represents many of the GPs who are not taking up these contracts? Will they give the parents of children under the age of six an assurance that this service will be available to them as stated by the end of next month?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	Every hospital management has to be alerted to the issue of elderly patients being on trolleys for unacceptably long periods of time, which was mentioned by the Deputy. I know the Minister is absolutely determined to ensure such cases should not actually occur. I want to sympathise with those affected by the recent cases, including their families. As the Deputy knows, €5 million is being spent on finalising a new emergency department in Tallaght. As his party's health spokesperson, he will also be aware that the very successful urgent assessment units are now used quite widely. They have been in use in my local hospital in Blanchardstown for most of this year. Older people, particularly those over the age of 70 who often have chronic conditions, can go to those assessment units and be looked after extremely well. This takes them out of the emergency department situation very quickly. This system works very well. I understand that Tallaght is in the process of developing an urgent care approach to very elderly patients who come in. This is happening alongside the work in the emergency department. On the issue of GP cards and GP care for under sixes, I have to say I am very pleased at the level of response so far, which is just over 50% of the eligible doctors.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	These decisions are made for medical and business reasons by the doctors' practices and the many medical companies that are involved in this sector nowadays. Very good progress has been made with this initiative, which has been discussed in this country over a long period of time. The number of GPs signing up has actually been very good in my constituency and in most of the suburbs on the north and west sides of Dublin. That is important for the families of the children involved. As Deputy Kelleher is aware, parents will very shortly be able to apply online to register their under sixes to receive GP services from local medical practitioners. I understand there are specific problems in some areas of the country. While the figures have been extremely high in places like County Donegal and the west and north sides of Dublin, they are rather disappointingly lower at the moment in places like County Tipperary. The Deputy mentioned that there are problems in Cork. I believe all of these problems can be addressed over time. Obviously, medical practitioners have to make these decisions. I believe the under sixes GP card is good for the health of all children under the age of six. We will be rolling out the provisions for people over the age of 70 the following month. We have ambitions to extend this initiative further in line with the programme I agreed with the Taoiseach when I was appointed as Tánaiste. It is intended to roll it out to other primary school children and ultimately to all children under the age of 18.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	If the 50% rate mentioned by the Tánaiste is in line with the Government's aspiration, it is a very poor effort. The provision of universal access to GPs for everybody is a stated policy in the programme for Government that was formulated in March 2011, which said that everybody in the country would have access to GP care free of charge. We were told there would be universality across the board. We are now over four years in and we have a situation where just half of GPs have signed up to the first effort to roll out this strategy. This means that large tranches of the population will be discommoded. These people will not have access to their family GPs. The Government had four years to negotiate this. We are now at the 11th hour and families are unsure of what services will be available to them in the coming weeks when they try to access their family doctors.  The broader issue is that it is simply not good enough to apologise to the 102 year old who had to lie on a trolley for 24 hours. Apologies will not change the policies being pursued by the Government. The under-resourcing of primary care, which is under huge pressure, is driving people into hospitals. GPs are referring people to hospitals because they cannot cope with chronic illness and disease. Even though the Government has a stated policy of keeping people out of hospitals, everything it is doing is facilitating the reverse. I hate to inform the Tánaiste that her constituency colleague, the Minister for Health, was doing his usual grand tour of radio stations this morning and waxing lyrical while making observations about health. He seems to forget he is the person who is ultimately in charge and responsible for the health service.

Over 400,000 people are waiting to see a consultant. The Taoiseach promised in 2011 to reduce the number of trolleys but there is a crisis every day in the emergency departments. The Government accepts that to have 350 or 400 people lying on trolleys is fine. It is not the case that it is all fine. The Minister for Health tells us that the budget presented to the Dáil last year was realistic but he can tell Shane Coleman today that he needs more beds, money and resources. At the heart of this is a lot of disingenuous talk, nonsense and spin. Our health services are now in rag order. Patients are suffering day in, day out. I should not have to raise it here. The Tánaiste should know that. She only has to look at the trolley figures for Beaumont, Tallaght and many other hospitals around the country. The Government’s stated policy was to reduce trolley numbers in our emergency departments and give free access to everybody by the end of this year, but none of that has been achieved. It is a shameful, sad indictment. In the context of general practitioner services, will the Government commit to giving additional resources to primary care to address the problems people face in having to go to acute hospitals because they cannot access treatment in their communities?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	The task force on overcrowding and trolleys in hospitals and emergency departments has been allocated an additional €74 million to ease the difficulties. It is not acceptable to have somebody of an advanced age on a trolley for anything longer than a number of hours. This is something that hospital management must address. Anybody who has experience of waiting with an elderly person in the small hours knows that is a difficult and worrying place to be. The additional resources for and development of the urgent assessment units and special access for older people are working really well in several hospitals around the country. The ideal would be that somebody of an advanced age, with a complex medical history, should not have to go through the normal emergency section but should be able to go to the urgent assessment units. I agree with the Deputy that primary care will be the best basis for the health service in this and every other country in years to come because it achieves the objective of helping to keep people out of hospitals. Very fine primary health care centres are being built around the country. In my constituency, one opened recently on the Navan Road. It is a fine three-storey building with diverse primary medical care facilities. In Corduff where, when Fianna Fáil was in government it had been promised for more than a decade during the best period of the boom, it was an empty site with grass growing on it.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	This morning, we learned the very distressing and alarming news that a 19 year old Dublin man has gone on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail. Ibrahim Halawa was born in the Coombe. He went to Holy Rosary national school in Firhouse and then to Rockbrook College in Rathfarnham. He finished his education in the Institute of Education on Leeson Street. He is a Dubliner. Ibrahim has been detained for two years without trial. He was 17 when he was arrested so he never collected his leaving certificate results. His trial has been postponed on four separate occasions. He is held in an adult prison in an oppressive and cramped cell with 40 other people. Every morning when he wakes he hears the screams of people being tortured. He has been beaten. The Irish consul in Egypt has witnessed his injuries. He has been denied medical attention. If convicted, Ibrahim faces the very real prospect of life imprisonment.  Amnesty International has done considerable work on his case and has established beyond any doubt that Ibrahim Halawa is a prisoner of conscience. It firmly believes that he has been detained solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly. What would the Tánaiste or any of us do if this was our child? I believe we would go to hell and back to secure his release. We would demand that the Taoiseach pick up the phone and tell the Egyptian Prime Minister to release this Irish citizen. That is what the Australian Prime Minister did to secure the release of journalist Peter Greste who shared a cell with Ibrahim. He did what any leader would do to protect the rights of a citizen. He intervened directly and decisively and secured the release of Peter Greste.  Will the Tánaiste join me today in calling on the Taoiseach to pick up the telephone to the Egyptian Prime Minister and call for the immediate release of Ibrahim? Will she also tell us whether she agrees with Amnesty International that Ibrahim is a prisoner of conscience and should be released immediately?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Anybody who has read or heard about this issue through the media, or who has had an opportunity to meet people with a deep interest in this case, as I have, including members of his immediate family, whom I met briefly, would want to see Ibrahim Halawa at home in the bosom of his family in Ireland. We know that he went to Egypt to see his extended family when he was 17 and was there at the time of the Arab Spring, when there was a great deal of demonstration and unrest and associated events. It is regrettable that the Egyptian authorities have not been in a position to process the various legal issues. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, with whom I have discussed the issue, other Ministers, and in particular, our ambassador and consular staff in Egypt, have maintained constant contact with Ibrahim and the Egyptian authorities to ensure that, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances he is in, the Egyptian authorities are aware of the deep level of concern about this case in Ireland, which remains a priority for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Officials at the embassy in Cairo are monitoring and closely following the case. Mr. Halawa has received more than 40 consular visits since he was first detained, the most recent of which took place earlier this week. As with all hearings in his case, officials from the embassy were in attendance. I understand the case may come up again on 2 August. In the meantime, officials in the Department will remain in constant contact.  One of the approaches that may help to resolve this case would be if Mr. Halawa's bail application were accepted. The Government has been happy to support the bail application. I use the forum of the Dáil to urge the Egyptian authorities to consider the case of a teenager visiting Egypt with his extended family who became caught up in some of the events occurring in that country at the time and has since been languishing in prison under varying conditions that are of deep concern to everybody. I commend Amnesty International on taking such a close interest in this case. It is a matter of concern to all of us that an Irish citizen should be in this position. I have spoken about the case with other members of the Government and I hope all of the work that is being done, particularly by our diplomatic officials and through a series of diplomatic channels, will result in Mr. Halawa being returned home safely to his family in Dublin.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	The reason this young man's detention has been so drawn out and harrowing is precisely that the Government has not prioritised his safety, welfare and return. I have been speaking to members of the Halawa family and they are not convinced or satisfied that the Government has acted fully and appropriately to secure the safety and freedom of one of our citizens. To visit Mr. Halawa on 40 occasions may sound like an impressive statistic on the part of the Irish system but even if he received 140 visits, it would not be worth a candle to this young man if he continues to be detained in an Egyptian prison. I asked the Tánaiste two specific questions, both of which she sidestepped. First, I asked her to join me in calling on the Taoiseach to make direct contact with the Egyptian Prime Minister and demand the release of Mr. Halawa. It seems that only this level of intervention will work in this case. In my second question, I did not ask the Tánaiste to commend Amnesty International but to accept, on the floor of the Dáil, the organisation's findings by acknowledging that Ibrahim Halawa is a prisoner of conscience. Unless we have this level of decisive thinking and action from the Government, this traumatic case will drag on and on.  Mr. Halawa's mother visits him every week, having moved to Egypt since he was detained to be close to her son. She does not have any contact with Ibrahim on these visits and sees him behind wire. She cannot comfort or console him or give him a hug. The family is distraught and concerned for Ibrahim's health, physical safety and mental health. The case has reached the point where this young man has undertaken a hunger strike and his life hangs in the balance. The Government has been at best tepid in its approach to securing his safety and freedom. What is needed is the direct intervention of the Taoiseach.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	On 14 May last, I asked the Tánaiste a question about the devastating impact on some children of living in inappropriate accommodation as a result of the terrible effects of successive Governments' housing policies or lack thereof.I was looking particularly at children in direct provision and children living in bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation. One week later, two reports came out that confirmed what I was saying. There was a HIQA report which showed that 14% of children of asylum seekers living in direct provision accommodation were not safe. They were subject and exposed to domestic violence, physical abuse and isolation. The report of the office of the Ombudsman for Children showed that in 2008, 6.8% of children were living in consistent poverty, while today it is 11.7%, which translates to 138,000 children. The quotes I take from the report are: "The Government is tolerating unacceptable levels of child poverty," and "B&B accommodation impacts negatively on family life and children's development." Last week, we had a report from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commissioner, who asked in an article she wrote how the Government would explain and defend the increased poverty rates we see and why many groups already susceptible to poverty and inequality were disproportionately affected by the recession. Children are part of that group. I cannot but be struck by what I have said here, given aspects of the debate on the commission of investigation over the last few days. One of these was the question of whether the write-down was €110 million or €119 million. The €9 million discrepancy was bandied about as if it were €9. There is no doubt that there has been preferential treatment for the privileged few, while the reality for those who suffered vicious cuts is very different. Housing is one of the casualties. In her reply on 14 May, the Tánaiste gave me various answers to the housing issue, but in the meantime all of the homeless charities have seen families living in unsuitable and risky places. There is also a fear that children will be joining the numbers of rough sleepers. We know the problems, and HAP was presented as one of the solutions. However, the homeless charities are saying there are areas in which HAP will not work, given that it was supposed to match market value. We had another answer around rent control and rent management, and I ask what is happening in that regard. The other aspect is that we have examples of international best practice. Holland is one country in which there are landlords who want to get into the private rented market. Has that been looked at? My general question is this: where is the urgency to address this crisis?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	As I mentioned previously in the House, I met at length last week with a number of the organisations that are working very hard to address issues relating to homelessness. I use this opportunity to stress again that if there is anyone out there, particularly families with children but also anyone else, who has a difficulty around rents or tenancies and fears that he or she is at risk of homelessness, I ask him or her to contact the local Intreo social welfare office to seek an appointment with the community welfare service. At this point in time, we have a protocol we operate with organisations such as Threshold, Simon and Focus Ireland on a country-wide basis in co-operation with local authorities to provide an extensive one-to-one service to help people who are at risk of becoming homeless, who are homeless or who have difficulty renegotiating rent or a tenancy. The protocol is working extremely well and we have extended it right around the country and it is available nationally. It is working very well in Cork because of the dedication of the public servants operating the system and of the voluntary organisations, particularly Simon in Cork, in seeking to access accommodation for people. I use this opportunity to stress to all Members that the service is available and that it can respond extremely quickly. However, it means that people must actually go and utilise it. Where we have mobile phone numbers, which we do in many cases, we send out regular texts to remind people that if they have a difficulty with housing and they contact the community welfare service in their local Intreo office, they will receive help and advice. We have done that in a large number of cases. On the overall issue of housing supply, the only way that will be addressed is by increasing the number of houses being built and the number of houses available to local authorities. Unfortunately, under the previous Government, the building of local authority accommodation came to a standstill because the policy of the Green Party and Fianna Fáil was to rely almost entirely on the private sector.

The priority at the moment is for families with issues around homelessness to be dealt with as quickly as possible by the local authority. However, it is going to take us some time to come to terms with all of the different elements of the housing crisis. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will be bringing proposals to Cabinet shortly on areas around rent certainty.

In quarter 1 of 2015, one homeless group worked with 116 homeless children in Dublin. That was an 87% increase on the 62 children they worked with in quarter 1 of 2014. Another organisation tells me that its view is that while it is waiting for the initiatives to make progress, 70-plus children will become homeless every month. I was outside with others yesterday, including Deputy Joan Collins, at the lone parent family protest. They make up 60% of the families in emergency accommodation. In July, a further 30,000 one-parent households will be affected by the last phase of the one-parent family payment reform. There are real concerns among housing organisations that the reform will push lone parents further from the workforce and expose them to a higher risk of homelessness. We know that social housing is a major part of the answer, but it is reckoned that the plan to build 1,700 social housing units by 2017 will provide 2% of the housing needed by those currently on the social housing list, which is being added to all the time. Focus Ireland ran an e-mail campaign recently on foot of which approximately 4,000 e-mails were sent to the Taoiseach. The e-mails were on particular issues including rent certainty and increasing rent supplement to reflect market value, but there was also a call to provide that when a family is assessed by a local authority as being homeless, the local authority must then provide a place to stay until more suitable accommodation is available. The call was for local authorities to be resourced to do that. The Taoiseach did not reply. I am asking for the Tánaiste's response and I ask her to ensure that this becomes seen as the urgent matter it is. Some of us are in constituencies that are particularly affected by this, including the Tánaiste. Given that we can make other issues urgent, why not the housing issue?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	177	I had an opportunity recently to meet with the various organisations. Unfortunately, because of the general disturbance in front of Deputy O'Sullivan and some of it behind me, I was unable to hear everything she said on the statistics. I understand, however, that some of the statistics were ones I discussed with the Focus Ireland delegation, including its new CEO, who came to see me.I agree that those statistics are very worrying. What we need to do is to get all the different authorities to come together, particularly Dublin City Council, to open up the closed properties, of which there are more than 1,000. The council has been given the funds to refurbish them. I know that builders are anxious to do the work on them. The key is to make those properties available. As the Deputy said, those families will have a degree of priority with respect to the properties. All of these arrangements have been made with the local authorities, so the key thing is to see that families get those houses. The Deputy referred to social welfare payments and to the UN committee hearings held earlier this week. I am sure the Deputy knows that because of social welfare transfers and social welfare payments to families we have the largest reduction in the at-risk-of-poverty grouping. Not only is our social welfare system strong, but it is my intention to make it stronger. Part of the strength of the social welfare system is that nowadays it helps families to get into work, whether those are one-parent families or families with two parents. That has been a passion of mine since I first became involved in politics. It is very good to have a strong social welfare system. My work as Minister for Social Protection has been to ensure strong social protection in this country. However, it is even better if a person can get a well-paid job that will give him or her greater financial independence. I refer to the changes currently under way.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	179	Very significant numbers of people will benefit by between €50 and €150 a week in additional earnings. That might not sound like a lot of money to people in here on a TD's salary, but for a family it is a very significant amount. As with the housing protocol, this policy has been ongoing in the Department for the past three years and already in the past two years 19,000 families have transited. It is a one-on-one interaction and if any of those families also have housing issues they can meet the community welfare service at the same time as the employment officer. It was the case in the past that when an individual went on lone parent benefit the expectation was often that he or she might stay on it for 20 to 30 years. What we want to do now is to offer a service to the families who have been coming in to see us. The outcomes have been extremely positive and perhaps when time permits we will arrange for some of the Deputies who are interested to actually visit and see the system in the social welfare offices, where people are involved in really positive engagements about how to provide a better future for themselves and for their children.

There seems to be some divergence of views between the Labour Party and Fine Gael with regard to the cap on admissions of sons and daughters of past pupils. Some are proposing a cap of 10% and other parties are proposing a cap of 25%. When will this Bill come before the House? A little more than four years ago, the House debated the Moriarty tribunal and its findings. The report was referred to An Garda Síochána and to the Director of Public Prosecutions, there being an issue of public interest. Has the Tánaiste any information with regard to the report? Is a file being prepared by the DPP? Can that information be accessed? When will the criminal procedure Bill be before the House? In other public prosecution services around the world, information is given as to whether a case will proceed and the reasons if it is not to proceed, whereas we are left completely in the dark on an issue of huge public interest. A tribunal was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas to investigate payments to politicians, and four years after its publication, we do not know what is happening with regard to that report. A commitment was made in speeches last week by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste about implementation of the recommendations on lobbying, openness, transparency and accountability and all of that. However, the key issue of accountability will not be addressed until such time as we know what is happening with regard to the completion of investigations by the prosecutorial forces in this country, those being the Garda Síochána and the DPP. Will the Tánaiste assure the House that the criminal procedure Bill will come before it so that we can address this issue of not knowing, in view of the fact that the Taoiseach looked like a scared rabbit when he was asked about Mr. O'Brien yesterday in an interview by the journalist Ann Cahill? He said that what was in the past was in the past. I am sorry, but the past is very much in the future or the present. The Moriarty tribunal is very much in the present, because its report was published four years ago and has not been fully dealt with.

I would expect to see it advanced quite quickly after that. I did not quite understand the Deputy's point about the cap on admissions in schools. To be clear for the record of the House, the former Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, indicated that his preference was for a cap of 25%. Following the discussions, to which many Members contributed, the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, indicated her preference for a figure in the region of 10%.

When might we see the publication of the report from the Fennelly commission? I ask her to confirm that it has been supplied today to interested parties and to give the House a sense of the timeline. Sinn Féin and I have raised previously in the House serious allegations of corruption in planning matters in County Wicklow. The serious allegations include questionable zoning practices, one of which at least resulted in the loss of a significant number of jobs in Newtownmountkennedy. I know that three former Labour Party councillors brought these allegations of corruption to the Tánaiste's direct attention. I am sure she is also aware of a file that went missing from the office of her colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, pertaining to allegations of corruption in planning in County Wicklow.The files disappeared and then reappeared. We have raised these matters before but have never received any satisfactory or even coherent response to them.

Given that the Tánaiste is familiar with these matters, I request that she ask the Government to give time next week for a debate on the issues in question. In respect of the Water Services Bill, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, told us that they would introduce measures by which unpaid water charges could be taken from people's wages, welfare or pensions. As there does not seem to have been any mention of that legislation since, can the Tánaiste tell us what timetable is envisaged in respect of its introduction?

That is the normal process of commissions and I assume that in due course, when the process is completed and when the judge who is handling the commission so decides, we will get the published report. Deputy McDonald gave a detailed commentary on County Wicklow and Newtownmountkennedy specifically. I will certainly ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for a report on the matters she has raised.

When will the building control Bill, which is No. 82 on the Government's legislative programme, come before the House? I also wish to ask about the insurance Bill, which is No. 93 on the Government's legislative programme. In recent months, people have been receiving their car insurance renewal premiums in the post.

If we can get the councils working as quickly and strongly as possible in getting through all the stages, we will be able to house more families sooner. That allocation was made some time ago and it is a matter for Galway City Council to process it on time.

It is nice to lighten up the temperature in here. On the issue of GP care for children under six and the Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, what is really going on? In south Tipperary, two GPs have signed up. I have serious questions as to who is driving this agenda and serious concerns about the role of the Irish Medical Organisation and its relationship with the HSE. This is very serious. The Government will not deal with the new organisation which now represents half the GPs. In an earlier reply to Deputy Kelleher, the Tánaiste said----

In Tipperary, where are the patients going to go when there are no doctors to take them? Two GPs have signed up in south Tipperary and it is bullying of the highest order of a profession that is under siege by the Government.

I am sure the Tánaiste is aware that there is an alarming shortfall in the number of people currently in trade apprenticeships. This needs to be addressed.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	231	I am happy to say that we have had 1,000 additional apprenticeships since Christmas. I had the privilege of being with the ESB as it launched a very ambitious three-year programme for apprenticeships and had many tens of thousands of young people indicating an interest. I know this matter is a very important priority for the Minister for Education and Skills. The Apprenticeship Council of Ireland is now reformed and up and running and there have been invitations to other areas of trade and activity to submit proposals for new apprenticeships.I know the Minister has received over 80 proposals and she will probably be able to make announcements in some months time, when the proposals have been evaluated. It is a great part of the general recovery in the economy that is spreading out to every family and has our unemployment rate back down at 9.8%, the best that we have achieved since 2009. I look forward very much to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, having the apprenticeships Bill before the Dáil later this year.

I have seen the same media reports that some interim documentation has been circulated to interested parties and, obviously, as I am not an interested party, I would not have received it. When these matters are dealt with between the judge and the various parties, it will hopefully then clear the way for the subsequent publication of the report. However, I do not have any timelines. The timelines are a matter for the interested parties but even more particularly for the judge in charge of the inquiry. That is a matter for the judge to call. I do not have any information on what is proposed.

A number of weeks ago we saw publication of the children's rights report where the Government received an F grade for its total and abject failure in regard to child poverty, with one in eight children now living in consistent poverty. The Tánaiste promised during the Order of Business that she would secure a Dáil debate in regard to how, as a collective Legislature, we can tackle child poverty. We are almost two months on from that promise and there is no indication of such a debate. Will the Tánaiste indicate when that debate will be facilitated? Will she indicate when the national vetting legislation will be commenced? It went through the Houses of the Oireachtas over two years ago but it has yet to be commenced. When will the Child and Family Relationships Bill be commenced? We talk about homelessness and about poverty in the context of the lack of funding for councils. A very important funding stream for councils over the years was the tenant purchase scheme but no tenant purchase scheme has been in operation for the past 12 months. When will the Government finally bring forward the much-promised tenant purchase scheme?

It is a great tribute to all the parties in this House that we have broad agreement that social welfare and income support for families, particularly families with children, should be as strong as it is, notwithstanding the enormous difficulties we inherited when we took over office from Fianna Fáil, with an economy in ruins and employment destroyed. We have now got back to a situation where, I am happy to say, the economy is growing and is one of the strongest in Europe, where hundreds of thousands of people are back at work and, thankfully, people are returning who previously, unfortunately, emigrated after Fianna Fáil crashed the country.

It will restate, enhance and promote the role and relevance of trade unions in civil society. Enhancing the role and place of the collective bargaining process in the workplace and putting it on a stronger statutory footing will have beneficial impacts on the lives of individuals and their families, and will also be a broadly civilising force in society. The introduction of the measure at this time causes us to evoke the memory of the origins of the trade union movement in the nineteenth century, the era of the industrial revolution. It was an era in which the character, shape and location of work changed fundamentally. The new work settings of factories could be brutal places, with brutalising experiences. It was the trade unions that intervened. They had a transformative impact, civilising the workplace, giving workers a say in pay and conditions and creating workers' rights. The agents of that transformative process were the trade unions.  Today, the character of work is once again changing rapidly. Work settings are changing. Old practices, technologies and established attitudes are being set aside or abandoned.Some employers see these new work settings as fresh opportunities to reassert their authority and become the sole arbiter over workers' rights, their wages and conditions of employment. They want to have the final say on levels of pay, conditions in the workplace, on terms of employment, etc. This can become a hazardous environment for workers’ rights. It is also an opportunity, however, to restate and renew some of the historical truths about pay conditions, etc. The Minister of State’s proposed new measures will be a vital instrument in that progressive process. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, for his dedication to this cause. Society is lucky that we have someone of his calibre with a deep and long history of experience in trade union activity and of thinking creatively about trade unions in the changing environment. If we did not have someone of the Minister of State’s calibre bringing forward this legislation, we would be losing important rights not just for workers but for all of us and civil society.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit agus buíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an tseans labhairt ar an mBille seo. I welcome this legislation and commend the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, on bringing it to the House. It contains important provisions for the reintroduction of registered employment agreements, REAs, which were struck down by the Supreme Court and makes provision for collective bargaining. At the same time, the Minister of State is steering important legislation regarding the minimum wage and low pay through the Seanad. This package of legislative proposals on industrial relations between the employer and employee is the most far-reaching reform of Ireland's industrial relations machinery in decades. The old structure of REAs had been struck down by the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. Whole sectors of the workforce previously protected by these agreements were left in limbo and this needed to be addressed urgently. An integral part of the deal on the sale of the State’s shareholding in Aer Lingus was based on the commitment that this legislation would be passed. It would then allow a series of REAs to be negotiated for various sectors of the Aer Lingus workforce and registered when this Bill becomes law. It is unlikely that the sale would have taken place if these REAs were not imminent. I hope no party or Member in either House will stand in the way of the passage of this legislation before the summer recess. It is important for Aer Lingus that the workforce will be able to engage directly with the employer as it is intended to protect against outsourcing of jobs and compulsory redundancies, as well as providing for pay and conditions of the Aer Lingus employees. The legislation also deals with ensuring compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on collective bargaining. It will allow workers where there is no collective bargaining in place to access the Labour Court. One of the key issues addressed by James Larkin in the 1913 Lock-out was the right of workers to organise through a union and to collectively bargain on their employment terms and conditions with their employers. Thankfully, this vibrant issue in our history is now being addressed. We are not going out on a limb in any way. Collective bargaining is a fundamental legal right in 24 of the 27 EU member states. It is the norm rather than the exception. It is significant we have these particular measures before us today. What is required is to do this in the context of the recovery that is taking place in our society. As the economy is beginning to recover, the quality of our society is equally important. We need decent working conditions for employees. That is the type of civilised society to which we should look forward. A good quality civilised industrial relationship machinery is extraordinarily important. It will deal with issues like the unattractive situation for Dunnes Stores employees. It will be difficult not to have such matters dealt with under this new legislation. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection recently amended the Pensions Act to allow collective representation and recognition for groups representing former workers at the stage where trustees have applied for section 50 orders to the Pensions Authority. Could we begin to examine the possibility of not just workers being protected by industrial relations machinery but also former workers? Hopefully, both Ministers opposite will put this on their agenda for the not-too-distant future. I commend this legislation to the Dáil.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015. It gives the Oireachtas an opportunity to devise a framework that will provide for maximum industrial peace and constructive working arrangements. It includes new industrial relations laws which will rebalance the interests of both employers and employees. In the absence of collective bargaining, it will provide new mechanisms for workers who want to improve their terms and conditions of employment. For instance, in the current Dunnes Stores episode, collective bargaining could be used by the workers to advance their claims should the company continue to refuse to engage with them. The economy is gradually improving as a result of the many sacrifices made by the various sectors in industry and general business. These collective efforts are now benefitting the economy.It is most important this is further enhanced and developed to ensure everybody will experience the benefits of the recovery, which I hope will keep on the track it is at present and the economy will thrive. The other very heartening matter is the employment graph is positive and the availability of full-time jobs is on the increase. It is crucial the legislation is fast-tracked and implemented at as early a date as possible. Among the matters contained in the Bill which I very much welcome are that the Labour Court will examine issues such as pay and sick leave provided by other employers in the relevant industry before making formal recommendations. The legislation is aimed at ensuring employers agree to come to the negotiating table or risk the prospect of being hauled before the Circuit Court. This is something those involved in the ongoing saga at Dunnes Stores in particular will welcome very much. What is happening there is not common but isolated enough, and I hope it will be corrected. By and large employers are fair people and I hope this will not go down the legal route. Businesses try to run as good a shop as possible and remain viable. They have gone through a very enduring time over the past five or six years in particular. The legislation would give comfort all round and with a bit of common sense and fair mindedness I am sure it will be implemented for the overall good. The Bill provides for the reintroduction of a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements between employers and trade unions governing remuneration and conditions of employment in individual enterprises. It provides for a new statutory framework for establishing minimum rates of remuneration and terms and conditions of employment for a specified type, class or group of workers, particularly in the context of transnational provision of services and promoting harmonious relations between workers. In effect it is a framework to replace the former sectoral registered employment agreements. The Bill will put in place legislative amendments to the industrial relations legislation of 2001 and 2004 which are required to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to reform the law on employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining. This will ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The statement of Government priorities for 2014 to 2016 included the enactment of collective bargaining legislation as approved by the Government. The main reform proposed in the Bill deals with proposed changes to the system of registered employment agreements and thereafter with collective bargaining reform. The implications of the proposed reforms are dealt with thereafter. Recent years have seen significant changes in the sphere of collective bargaining in Ireland and important court challenges have been made to the framework. John Grace Fried Chicken Limited and Others v. The Catering Joint Labour Committee and Others was a High Court challenge to Part IV of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 which found there to be insufficient principles and policies for the exercise of the law-making power, which had been conferred on joint labour committees and which was found to be unconstitutional. On 7 July 2011, the High Court delivered its judgment in this case and found the joint labour committee wage setting mechanisms to be unconstitutional. The case was taken by John Grace Fried Chicken Limited of Cork and the Quick Service Food Alliance, an organisation representing a group of fast food outlets, and concerned an application to strike down an employment regulation order as unreasonable and constituting an unlawful interference with constitutionally protected property rights. The plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of sections 42, 43 and 45 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and section 48 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990. Mr. Justice Feeney in the High Court held that as the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 and 1990 failed to set out any matters that could properly be described as policies or principles directing or informing the joint labour committees and the Labour Court as to the matters to be taken into account in carrying out the fundamental task of fixing wage rates and conditions of employment, the power delegated to those bodies was excessive and amounted to an impermissible transfer of power. Thus sections 42, 43 and 45 of the 1946 Act were found to be repugnant to the Constitution. The John Grace decision resulted in Part IV of the 1946 Act being deemed invalid. Consequently, 17 employment regulation orders ceased to have any force in law from 7 July 2011. The decision was not appealed to the Supreme Court, and the Government enacted the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 to rectify the difficulties identified in the John Grace decision. McGowan and Others v. The Labour Court and others was a challenge to Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 covering registered employment agreements. The Supreme Court decision has been interpreted by the Government as having struck down Part III in its entirety, such that amendments made by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 cannot attach to an unconstitutional regime. The case concerned a registered employment agreement for electrical contractors working in the construction trade and registered by the Labour Court on 24 September 1990, pursuant to Part III of the 1946 Act. Employers' organisations had long complained that this registered employment agreement, to which they were not a party, imposed obligations industry-wide and that the employer interests were not adequately represented.The litigation was set in the context of an employee proposal to vary the REA in order to increase the minimum rate of pay in the sector, among other complex procedural matters. The issue in this case was ultimately narrowed down to the question of whether Part III of the 1946 Act offended against Article 15.2.1o of the Constitution in the delegation of a law-making role to the Labour Court and to the parties to the REA. In other words, did Part III permit an excessive delegation of legislative powers? In Ryanair v. the Labour Court and IMPACT in 2007, the Supreme Court found that the Labour Court did not adopt fair procedures in applying the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 in deciding whether there was a trade dispute and whether a practice of collective bargaining was found at Ryanair. The context of the dispute was the terms and conditions of a training course offered to Ryanair pilots based in Dublin so that the pilots could fly larger airplanes. The pilots were unhappy with a particular term of the training, such that if Ryanair was compelled to engage in collective bargaining with any union within five years of the training, the pilots would have to compensate Ryanair for the cost of the training, which was €15,000. Following a failure to reach agreement on the issue, IMPACT and IALPA sought to bring a trade dispute before the Labour Court under the 2001 and 2004 Acts. However, Ryanair rejected the jurisdiction of the Labour Court on the basis that there was no trade dispute as it is understood in the 2001 Act. It was the practice of Ryanair to engage in collective bargaining negotiations in respect of the pilots who were party to the trade dispute, if any, and the internal dispute resolution procedures had not failed to resolve the dispute, if any. The Labour Court decided for IMPACT on the jurisdiction point in January 2005 and Ryanair challenged that specific jurisdictional decision by way of judicial review in the High Court. Mr. Justice Hanna in the High Court upheld the Labour Court’s jurisdiction but the Supreme Court decided in favour of Ryanair. The judgment of Mr. Justice Geoghegan was delivered on 1 February 2007. Ryanair claimed that collective bargaining in the company operated by way of a continual process in which Ryanair negotiated with representatives of its employees for the purpose of concluding collective agreements which fixed pay and other conditions of employment. This system of employee representative committees, ERCs, was described as a forum for employee representatives to negotiate terms and conditions with the company on an ongoing basis. However, Dublin pilot representatives withdrew from this forum in August 2004. Such withdrawal gave rise to the question of whether collective bargaining still existed in the company for that group of workers. IMPACT argued that the individuals elected as employee representatives did not engage in negotiation but, at most, a form of consultation. Even if the ERC could be considered a negotiating body, there were no pilot representatives on the ERCs and for this reason it could not be considered an excepted body in respect of pilots. The Labour Court agreed with this argument when it assumed jurisdiction over the matter. The Supreme Court thus agreed with Ryanair that the decision of the Labour Court was flawed and that the procedure was fundamentally unfair. However, as an obiter comment, the Supreme Court also criticised Ryanair's handling of the trade dispute, stating, "Continual propaganda in correspondence as to how excellent the company is rather than taking up the issues point by point was not helpful to anybody". Certain matters have recently been brought to my attention. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection recently amended the Pensions Act to allow collective representation and recognition for groups representing former workers at the stage where trustees have applied for section 50 orders to the Pensions Authority. While the Tánaiste's initiative is welcome, it does not go far enough to address the concerns of the majority of pensioners. I ask the Minister for Social Protection to take this a step further and amend the Pensions Acts to allow for collective pensioner representations at the front end, and not the back end, of a process addressing a pension scheme deficit. The fact that the principle of collective representation for former workers has been accepted and incorporated in pensions legislation now provides an opportunity in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 to change the definition of "worker" to include "former workers" and to grant them access to the industrial relations machinery of the State. The right of the trade unions to represent their members in negotiations with employers on industrial relations issues is an inherent part of the industrial relations process in Ireland. This would include the option to refer any disputes that may arise during discussions between the parties to an independent mediation or arbitration process. Former workers should be afforded the same rights as workers and legislation should be introduced that would require former employers to engage with representative bodies for former workers on all matters relating to their original contracts of employment and pension matters. I have been contacted by the ESB retired staff association. It is a national organisation, representing the interests of the majority of the ESB's 7,500 pensioners. What they are seeking in this Bill is, first, the rights of pensioner organisations to represent their members and to influence negotiations that would directly affect their financial security and, second, that pensioners would have access to the industrial relations and arbitration machinery of the State. The Government passed legislation for an annual 0.6% levy on the assets of private pension funds in 2011 which effectively raided pensioners' hard earned savings. The Government also introduced measures in budget 2013 that abolished or reduced household benefits. It was effectively a way of getting at private pensioners' earnings. I call for this to be abolished in the forthcoming budget.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015. Our programme for Government gives a fair commitment to reform the law that currently exists for employers' rights to participate in collective bargaining, thus ensuring that we must comply with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. Based on these judgments, we need to make provisions for an improved and modern industrial framework that will provide employers with clarity and employees with an effective alternative where collective bargaining agreements are not in place. The Bill will once and for all provide a clear and balanced mechanism whereby the employment conditions of workers are protected in a situation where no collective bargaining is in place. The Bill will also provide employers with a clear framework for managing their workplaces in the years ahead. In this regard I am pleased to see the new laws will provide a balance between the interests of the worker and that of the employer. This will be achieved through an improved collective bargaining system and will provide for registered employment agreements to be re-established and industry sector wage rates and conditions to be introduced, thus placing the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis.The Bill is the result of a lengthy consultation process that included intensive engagement with the relevant stakeholders. In this regard, I am pleased to see that the proposals have been welcomed by both IBEC and ICTU. I have no doubt that this Bill will provide for a framework that will allow all workers who wish to seek better terms and conditions in situations where no collective bargaining is in place or recognised by the employer and will provide a replacement for registered employment agreements. In practical terms, this will mean that in respect of the collective bargaining element of the legislation, workers who wish to improve their terms and conditions in places of employment where the employer does not recognise any collective bargaining arrangements now have a mechanism whereby they can commence a claim for better wages and terms and conditions with the help of a trade union, and have these claims determined by the Labour Court based on comparisons with similar companies. Like all Members of the House, I regularly have to deal with constituents who are having difficulty in their employment, particularly in respect of pay rates and terms and conditions of employment. I have had to deal with many cases where employees felt they had no means of addressing workplace issues like pay rates or terms and conditions of employment. This legislation will bring clarity to these employees. Indeed, this legislation will also bring clarity to employers, especially those who felt there was no basis for them to implement pay rates or terms and conditions they felt were appropriate to their particular business. I agree wholeheartedly with the Ministers involved that this legislation, when enacted, will complement Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions and also meet its international commitments and will therefore ensure our continued success in creating new and sustainable jobs and attracting much needed investment into the economy. In my constituency, Louth, we have seen over 3,500 new jobs created since we launched our Action Plan for Jobs and, as I have previously stated in the House, we are well on our way to reaching full employment by 2018. This legislation will provide new, clear, balanced and proven mechanisms to deal with specific industrial relations issues and will address the gaps that exist in protecting workers while also addressing the issue of low pay. It will also provide stability and certainty for employers who, we must recognise, are the ones creating the badly needed jobs in the first place.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	Here we are with the collective bargaining legislation. I think this is the third time I have spoken on this legislation. I feel like hell has finally frozen over because I am on the Dáil floor and am about to agree with something that Jimmy Kelly, the Unite union official, said last month. He said that this legislation does not provide for mandatory collective bargaining and, strictly speaking, he is absolutely right. People who are intimate with the putting together of this legislation know that to be the case. Many predictions have been made here today about what this is going to do. Nobody really knows how it will pan out. It could pass off very quietly or it could be a disaster. The reason he said that is that under this legislation companies may choose to negotiate with their employees through an employer-sponsored association. That is a good thing. For that reason, this could be much worse. This does not amount to what was promised in the first place, but it does allow some people to tick a box politically. I have spoken to many of the people involved in the Department and industry associations in particular and I understand how and why this legislation has been watered down along the way without causing any political embarrassment. One major industry association representative said to me that they can probably live with it, as long as it is not abused too badly by the trade unions. My reservations stem mainly from the timing. At the same time this legislation was mooted politically, the Minister for Finance was taking steps to end what has been called the "double Irish" tax situation and the issues surrounding transfer pricing as they relate to US companies that do business in Ireland. The European Commission got involved, particularly with companies like Apple, and applied pressure on our Government to end that situation. My point was, and remains, that we should have waited to see how that pans out before we start passing legislation like this because this legislation might ultimately act as a disincentive to inward investment. The reason I say that stems from the reality of what I do every day, namely, to work on the fundamentals when it comes to improving the conditions as they apply to foreign direct investment. In Waterford we are still in bad shape economically. It is improving a small bit, but it is not comparable to Dublin or Cork. The Minister will be well aware of this. In the last four years, I have, for example, kept the funding stream to the airport just about going, even when the commercial flights were not there. They are there now, thankfully. I have also made sure, after four years, that a regional director of the IDA was appointed. Thanks to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that finally occurred. It is tooth and nail stuff, in many respects, as a Fine Gael Deputy dealing with a Fine Gael Government. In many cases it is very hard to initiate change to the fundamentals involved. It is very difficult to get Departments to move. In the case of the Port of Waterford, it was a question of making an argument regarding the salary of the new CEO, who will be in place in August. That was difficult enough, bringing the salary from an €85,000 cap up to €125,000. Arguments had to be made and it took months. It is an essential component of the issue with the Port of Waterford, a company which is fine as regards governance, but which has been driven into the ground. New personnel were needed to take over the helm. All these things are the building blocks for inward investment and improving the conditions for US companies in particular, though not exclusively, which are looking at Ireland and the south east as a place to put their money. When it came to the nuts and bolts of this legislation, the background to it, the Ryanair case and industrial relations law in general, it is clear from talking to people that we have a voluntarist system in this country. There is a view among people who deal with labour law that there was no big problem in this area in the first place and that people, by and large - though there will be the odd exception - were dealing just fine with what transpired in labour law after the Ryanair decision. Their point is that when one is dealing with US companies in particular, and I have some experience with this, they are conservative. They take a certain view of mandatory labour laws and it is unwise to restrict the latitude that currently exists on either side when it comes to open negotiations. The example I would use is what happened early last year when it came to Bausch + Lomb in Waterford.A negotiated pay reduction of 7.5% was agreed along with the ending of bonuses and an increase in the working week. It was hammered out by people who are steps ahead of some of the politicians who were involved in it. Reality dawned on both sides that they had to deal with each other. Unfortunately, those cuts had to be made but since then the company has made a massive investment here. If this legislation is abused by unions keen to justify their own existence, we will need to be conscious of the potential impact it will have on our competitiveness and on our attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment. This country is in a position to create additional reasons for a company not to locate here. It was not that long ago when the Deputies opposite were telling the Germans how to run their economy and we all know how that ended up. We need to be careful about getting the balance right between safeguarding people's working rights, political agendas and the creation of jobs when it comes to foreign direct investment. This legislation might seem very reasonable and quite benign to some Members of the coalition but it may make corporate types think twice about locating here. Only time will tell. I reserve the right to draft amendments to the Bill and I hope and believe that they will be dealt with constructively by the Minister. I do not mean to be in any way patronising by saying that the way the Minister of State has dealt with this legislation has been fantastic. I believe Members on both sides of the House who have dealt with the Bill would agree with me in that regard. I have had a number of conversations with him and he knows where I am coming from on the Bill. I understand where he is coming from on this, politically and philosophically, but I hope he accepts that there is a genuine point of view on the other side. I appreciate the effort he and his officials have put into the legislation since he took it on.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. It seeks to reinstate the system of registering collective agreements in individual enterprises and will provide for a system of registering employment agreements on a sectoral basis. The Bill also aims to legislate for the right to collective bargaining and put in place anti-victimisation measures. The Bill has arisen as a result of a decision of both the High Court and the Supreme Court in regard to the constitutionality of the previous agreements. The previous situation with regard to the registration of employment agreements worked quite well. I practised in the area of industrial relations for 18 years and I saw the process in operation. There were very few problems with the previous situation. I have practised in that area on both sides of the divide. I was a personnel manager for 15 years and, subsequently, I was an employer's nominee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for nine years. I was a member of SIPTU and I was nominated by trade unions to contest the Seanad and I represented the Labour Panel in the Seanad twice. Therefore, I have seen the process operate from both sides. The existing legislation worked quite well. The necessity for it at that time was obvious. I do not want to name any sectors but it protected certain sectors very well which otherwise would not have been protected. It prevented the victimisation of certain categories of employees. It did not in any way restrict investment into the country. The companies that invest in the country and create employment are very good payers; they would not be come under the ambit of an employer with respect to the system as proposed in the Bill. The Bill represents a commitment by the Government to reform the current law on employee rights to engage in collective bargaining in order to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the Europe Court of Human Rights. We have a system of collective bargaining, which is voluntary, with the aid of the Labour Court and its services and other services. We have a system of trade unions and employer organisations, and that system has worked reasonably well over the years. We have also a system of as little engagement as possible by the Legislature in regard to collective bargaining. That is a very important yardstick in how we manage our industrial relations.  Under the Bill, the Labour Court is entitled to initiate a review of pay and pensions, seek entitlements and make recommendations to the Minister. The Minister should use the recommendations wisely and examine them rather than simply sign the order. It is important that the Minister adopts a hands-on approach to difficulties that employers, employer associations, employee associations and trade unions might have. The Labour Court can initiate a review of pay and conditions at the request of the employers and at the request of the trade unions. There is a balance in that regard. The experience of employers and employees prior to the existing legislation being rendered unconstitutional was quite positive and very few complaints were made about the operation of our industrial relations system. The Minister must be satisfied that the requirements under the legislation are complied with before he makes the order.  I welcome the legislation. I sincerely congratulate the Minister and the Government on bringing it forward. It is time that the previous situation was addressed.

It is very important and historic legislation. The two elements of it covering the registered employment agreements and collective bargaining are fundamentals in terms of our labour law and industrial relations system. I particularly noted the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, when introducing the Bill yesterday came under some attack from both Sinn Féin and a collection of career socialists whose contributions would probably go down as some of the most begrudging and negative criticisms of any Bill, but the Minister of State managed to survive the episode. There was much talk by some Opposition Members about workers' rights. We got a lecture from Sinn Féin on workers' rights. Obviously, its spokesperson is unaware that Sinn Féin was the very party during the Dublin Lock-out in 1913 that refused to support it; so much for taking lectures from such people. Also, the party's great founder and leader Arthur Griffith combined with the church and the pillars of industry in this city during the Christmas of the first Lock-out to attack James Connolly and James Larkin and called for the Lock-out to be ended. So much for the tutorial from Sinn Féin on workers' rights.It is 102 years late. Collective bargaining is essential for people, be they unionised or otherwise, who are on limited or low wages in that it provides them a structure of protection. This is why I described the Bill as historic. It is not perfect legislation and no one is making that argument. As the Minister of State mentioned yesterday, it might be subject to review if necessary. Apart from the collective bargaining element, the registered employment agreements, REAs, are fundamental, particularly for workers in certain industries where low pay is a feature, for example, retail. Many of these issues were highlighted last Saturday at the protest organised by the Mandate trade union which some of us attended. They were to the fore in the speeches made by various trade union leaders at the end of the march. The protest highlighted the importance of REAs, which were repeatedly mentioned, as well as the importance of collective bargaining to the trade union movement. For some of the same reasons, the Bill is subject to the criticisms that were voiced by a number of the same people when the Unfair Dismissals Act, equal pay for women and the redundancy legislation were introduced. Nowhere was this more striking than during the House's debate on the national minimum wage, where most of the criticisms were negative. We have spent the best part of 100 years trying to introduce labour legislation that, as much as possible, supports people in ensuring dignity and decency in their workplaces. The Bill is not perfect, but it was best summed up by the principal trade union leader, Mr. Jack O'Connor of SIPTU, in this month's edition of SIPTU's Liberty Newspaper. I agree with what he stated, namely:There is no denying [the Bill] represents progress. However, no law, irrespective of how good it is, will of itself tackle exploitation in the workplace. That is still down to the task of persuading workers to organise themselves in unions so that they can assert their entitlement to dignity and fair treatment. The measures envisaged in this new Bill will make it somewhat easier to do so, but it will not do it for us - we still have to do it ourselves.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	255	I am happy to see the introduction of this legislation. I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, for their work in this regard. In recent years, I have been concerned by the lack of a statutory framework to ensure that workers seeking to improve their terms and conditions can do so by seeking to engage in collective bargaining or REAs, the latter being particularly important, given the fact that the Supreme Court struck down the old REA framework on constitutional grounds. I am glad that the Government is now addressing this matter and has worked hard to ensure that the new REA framework is constitutionally robust. The Bill makes provision for the registration of employment agreements between employers and trade unions governing remuneration and conditions of employment. The content of these agreements will be a matter for the contracting parties and will be legally binding on those involved. The Bill also makes provision for a new type of ministerial order, the sectoral employment order, SEO, which will allow the Labour Court to trigger a review of the pay and conditions in a particular sector of industry and to make a recommendation to the Minister. Such a review can be initiated at the request, separately or jointly, of organisations substantially representative of employers or workers. There is broad acceptance that the reintroduction of REAs will benefit workers and employers. For both, these agreements and orders will provide certainty about future pay and conditions, thereby providing industrial peace. In a recovering economy, this is important. I am also pleased about Part 3 of the legislation, which fulfils a significant commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that Irish law is consistent with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights by providing a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where there is no collective bargaining agreement in the workplace. The Bill removes the right of access of "excepted bodies" to procedures dealing with collective bargaining legislation. An "excepted body" is the term used in the Trade Union Acts to describe a body such as an in-house works committee or the like that is not a registered trade union and conducts negotiations on pay and conditions only for the staff of one employer. Since the decision of the Supreme Court in Iarnród Éireann v. Holbrooke, it has been clear that a body cannot be an excepted body within the meaning of the Trade Union Act 1941 unless it conducts consensual negotiations with an employer. If a genuine excepted body is in operation, this means that genuine collective bargaining is happening. The point of all this is to ensure that a body that is an in-house committee or similar and is merely serving as window dressing to give the pretence of collective bargaining is not allowed to avail of this legislation. It is also important to point out that the Bill is concerned with providing a remedy where there is no collective bargaining; a fundamental reason for invoking this legislation must be the absence of collective bargaining negotiations. This prerequisite cannot be satisfied where there is a genuinely functioning excepted body. Under this legislation, if there is no consent, the Act can be invoked. Section 24 inserts a new subsection into the principal Act to give practical effect to the principle of the independence of an excepted body. It gives guidance to the Labour Court as to the criteria that it should take into account when determining whether an excepted body is engaged in collective bargaining and is genuinely independent of the employer. Section 24 also amends the principal Act by providing that, where an employer asserts to the Labour Court that it is his, her or its practice to engage in collective bargaining with an excepted body in respect of the workers concerned, it will be for the employer to satisfy the Labour Court on this. The Government has decided as a matter of policy that it would be preferable under this Bill for the workers involved in a dispute not to be required to make themselves known to their employers early in the process if possible so as to avoid any potential for victimisation. The new section provides that a statutory declaration made by the chief officer of the trade union concerned, setting out the number of its members who are party to the trade dispute and the period of membership in the grade, group or category to which the trade dispute refers, shall be admissible in evidence without further proof unless the contrary is shown. The Bill represents a significant step forward for workers and employers. It provides a clear, workable and constitutionally robust framework within which workers' remuneration and conditions of employment can be discussed and determined. I know of cases where this legislation would have helped and supported workers who were horribly victimised because they were trade unionists who sought to bargain collectively in unfair workplaces. We have seen recent examples of such. As this legislation did not exist at the time, those workers were sometimes bullied into silence, made redundant under spurious circumstances or constructively dismissed. I am proud to support this legislation, which has been an aim of the Labour Party for many years that is finally being put into effect. I am confident that this framework will fit Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions and international obligations, which is important, and will ensure continued success in creating jobs and attracting foreign investment into the economy. I warmly commend the Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22733	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	256	I thank the many Deputies who took part in this debate. There has been a broad welcome for their contributions. The Bill builds on the Government's record of putting in place balanced measures, particularly to protect the most vulnerable in the workplace. The Government's first act was to restore the minimum wage.We introduced legislation to cover temporary agency workers, a group of workers who were prone to abuse. We restored the joint labour committee structure after it was struck down by the courts. We are making two very important additional provisions in this legislation, the first of which deals with the issue of collective bargaining in a balanced way and the second of which restores the registered employment agreements. As many Deputies have pointed out, these agreements were struck down by the Supreme Court. In our economic policy, we are seeking to achieve a virtuous circle in which successful enterprises can win new markets and apply innovation in a way that delivers more jobs and a higher standard of living for people. As we rebuild our economy, people have a right to share in the success of businesses. That is very important. We were exposed when registered employment agreements, which had been an important part of ordered industrial relations in the past, were struck down. There is no doubt that there was a good tradition of registered employment agreements in the area of public procurement contracts. That is an area where there is concern about unfair competition entering into the marketplace. We have had to take a great deal of time to make sure we have something that is constitutionally robust. I think we have a great deal of confidence that this has been achieved. We have also tackled the issue of collective bargaining, which many people were very keen to see addressed in a balanced way that allows workers in circumstances in which there is no collective bargaining who are not getting fair terms and conditions to take cases ultimately to the Labour Court and thereby have their right to fair conditions vindicated. As Deputy Seán Kenny has pointed out, we have struck a balance here. There are good measures here to give workers genuine protections, including those he quoted, such as the genuine independence of the accepted bodies. We have built a protection against victimisation into this Bill. We have ensured the burden of proof will not expose workers who might be unfairly exposed. We have provided for comparability to look at pay levels in other similar areas, including collectively negotiated pay levels. On the other side, we have given the employer reasonable certainty that this mechanism will not be abused, that genuine negotiation will be recognised and that it will not be possible for this to be used by very small groups or used repetitively. We have ensured that employers will have certainty about the environment. Deputy Deasy asked whether this could be construed as an instrument that might scare foreign direct investment. I assure him that is not the case. We have been careful to deal with both sides of this in the way we have done. We have made sure we understand the needs of foreign investors. As Deputy Neville has pointed out, they pay well. The IDA average pay is well ahead of the average industrial wage. They are good-paying companies. This legislation is designed to deal with circumstances in which employers will not bargain and will not offer rates that are comparable elsewhere. I think we have dealt with that. I was reading the transcripts of the debates over the last two days. It is important to say that Deputy Maloney rightly put his finger on it when he said that a great deal of less-than-fair comment has been made. It has been suggested that the Government has used JobBridge to pretend it is providing employment, or to deliver employment that is not real. The CSO, which is an entirely independent body, has categorically shown that over the last two years, every single net job that has been created has been a full-time job. The number of part-time jobs has decreased. That is the truth of the matter and is there for everyone to read. We are delivering an economy with full-time employment. More than 105,000 people are back at work. That is a fantastic testimony to the ingenuity of Irish workers and businesses. They have gone further afield to win new markets and do new things. Bausch & Lomb offers a very good example of a workforce in a difficult situation that has reinvented the way it does things and won new investment. The voluntary approach to industrial relations, which has been at the core of our system, is delivering and has delivered in many workplaces, even in these very difficult times. The collective representation of retired people was raised by a number of Deputies. I certainly recognise the concerns they expressed, because pension funds are being restructured in a way that is obviously a challenge for people. It is important to bear in mind that the industrial relations machinery we are talking about here is voluntary in nature. People enter into it on a voluntary basis. It does not hand down mandatory arbitration. That has not been the approach. Reference was made to the whole issue of how decisions are made. They are made under the trust deeds and the rules of pension funds. We have to find within that legislative area new ways of making sure people get their concerns heard. The Minister for Social Protection has made revised provisions to give people a chance to learn of proposals in advance and make submissions under the revised section 50 guidelines. There is a real consciousness of this issue. If the Pensions Authority is issuing a unilateral direction under section 50 to the trustees, provision has been made for those who represent pensioners to have an opportunity to make representations to the authority in respect of those proposals. I should say in passing that we will introduce a provision on Report Stage in the House to ensure that a person who had an industrial relations issue before he or she retired, but who ceased to be a "worker" within the definition of the Industrial Relations Acts after he or she retired, will still be able to pursue the legitimate industrial relations concern that arose before he or she retired. We are making provision for that. A number of Deputies raised the serious issue of bogus self-employment. It is important to say we will be introducing enforcement measures on Committee Stage that will give considerable strength in the enforcement of registered employment agreements and sectoral orders, which are very prevalent within the construction sector. NERA is responsible for enforcing all elements of employment law, as Deputies are aware, but following the striking down of registered employment agreements, all it was in a position to enforce was the minimum wage, which obviously was much less than what was provided for in those agreements. I think we will be in a stronger position on foot of the reinstatement of the agreements. The issue of bogus self-employment is handled by the scope section in the Department of Social Protection, which makes swift decisions on the insurability of employment and the appropriate applicable class. NERA regularly refers cases to that section in the Department to ensure these provisions are not being used in an improper fashion. Given that NERA's activity included more than 5,500 inspections in 2014, including some inspections of construction sites, it is clear that it is taking a very active approach. Some Deputies suggested that the Bill should be more specific in setting out what constitutes "substantially representative" and "not insignificant", which are two terms used in the Bill. When we were drafting the Bill, we gave careful consideration to whether it would be helpful to include a specific percentage. We concluded that on balance it would be better to leave that matter to the Labour Court to determine based on guidance provided in the Bill. As the Labour Court is the expert in this area, my view is that it should be allowed the discretion to make an informed judgment on the issues on a case-by-case basis. The question of how to ensure accepted bodies are genuine was also raised. The Bill inserts a new subsection into the principal Act to give practical effect to the principle of the independence of an accepted body. Specifically, it provides guidance to the Labour Court on the criteria it should take into account when determining whether an accepted body is engaged in collective bargaining, as defined in the Act, and is genuinely independent of the employer.The Bill makes it clear that where collective bargaining takes place with an excepted body it must be genuine and have a track record. In this regard a high bar is set. Deputy Halligan raised voluntary engagements in collective bargaining. That reflects that the system of industrial relations in Ireland is a voluntarist one. He also raised an issue about failure to implement a recommendation of the Labour Court. The procedure there is that one can go back to the Labour Court and get a determination which is binding on both parties and enforceable in the Circuit Court. I thank the Deputies for their participation in this debate. This Bill has been a long time in gestation because it was absolutely essential to bring the sides together in respect of a complex Bill where there are sensitivities on both sides, and we had to ensure that we could get something that would be balanced and fair to everyone. That has taken time. I thank my officials who invested a lot of time in dealing with all of the parties involved. What has emerged is a good Bill that will protect workers for the future, will give employers certainty and will promote a harmonious industrial relations environment where people can look forward to improvements in their standard of living as the economy and enterprise improve and win new opportunities and create new employment. I commend the Bill to the House.

I am pleased to present the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Amendment Bill 2015 for the consideration of this House. This legislation is an important, almost final, milestone in the introduction of a national postcode system. Ireland is the only country in the European Union or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development without a postcode system. While successive Governments have grappled with this issue, this Government is now in a position to bring the postcodes project to a successful conclusion. The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 provided for the full liberalisation of the postal sector in Ireland. It included provisions, in section 66, to permit the Minister to establish a national postcode system. In July 2009 the then Government approved the launch of a procurement process for a national postcode, based on the 2006 report of the national postcode project board. In 2010, the Department established a postcode steering group and undertook a wide-ranging consultation on the implementation of a national postcode system. More than 60 interested parties were met as part of that process. There was a positive response to the consultation process, and the Department received detailed views on various issues, including the technical specification, dissemination and the commercialisation of the system. A detailed procurement process began in January 2011. In October 2013 the Government approved the appointment of Capita as the postcode contractor. Capita employs over 2,000 people in Ireland. They have been contracted to design, develop and implement the national postcode system, working with indigenous Irish companies to create the supporting technology for the project. The brand Eircode was approved by Government in April 2014. The ways in which we communicate and conduct our business have been radically transformed in recent years. This transformation is ongoing. Our digital economy is worth €8.4 billion, and is growing at a rate of 20% per year, five times faster than the rest of the economy. Research suggests that, by 2020, the value of the digital economy will have risen to 10% of gross domestic product, GDP, or over €21 billion. Irish consumers spend in excess of €6 billion a year. That is of the order of €700,000 per hour, 24 hours a day. Moving goods from a virtual point of sale to people's homes and businesses is a major logistical undertaking. During the consultative phase of this project, many stakeholders, in the public and private sectors, told us about the challenges of finding addresses in Ireland, particularly in rural areas. First, approximately 35% of premises have exactly the same address as another property. Second, in urban and rural areas, the same building can have multiple forms of address. Finally, and unlike other countries, we have no legal form of addressing in Ireland. We have, therefore, adopted a unique approach, tailored to meeting our unique addressing challenges. We have developed a postcode system that assigns a unique identifier to each address in the State. This approach is future-proofed in that it allows for future expansion in the number of addresses without changing Eircodes. It is also sustainable, with no requirement to re-assign or change existing Eircodes when new premises are built. Fundamentally, this project involves delivering a critical piece of national infrastructure which will secure benefits such as making it easier for consumers to shop online and assisting the development of Irish online commerce; improving the quality of access to public services, while reducing the cost; enabling commercial organisations to improve existing services and develop new service offerings; improving planning and analysis capabilities across public and private sectors; providing a stimulus to mail volumes through improved direct marketing capabilities; and making it quicker and easier for emergency services to locate addresses, particularly in rural areas. A comprehensive communications campaign has been developed for the introduction of Eircodes. Significant stakeholder engagement was undertaken during the procurement process and the initial roll-out. Thirty industry seminars have been conducted since March 2014. These industry groups include telecoms, energy, banking, insurance, retail and logistics. Over 1,000 people, representing over 600 companies have attended these sessions and additional seminars will be held over the next two months. Information for businesses is also available on the Eircode website which provides guidance on preparing for Eircode and details of the products and pricing. Sample data has also been made available to allow businesses and other organisations test their systems in advance of the launch. Immediately following the launch of Eircode every premises in Ireland will receive a letter containing the Eircode for that address. The letter will include information on the benefits of Eircode and how it can be used. The launch will also feature a national communications campaign involving television, radio, national and regional press. This will be complemented by an online tool to enable citizens to find Eircodes and addresses easily. Members of the public will be able to enter an address to find an Eircode or enter an Eircode to find an address. This Eircode finder will be easily accessible on a computer, tablet or smartphone. It will also be able to identify addresses on an ordnance survey map, helping the user with directions if needed. Equally important is an outreach programme managed by Capita, the Wheel and Irish Rural Link which is under way. This is reaching out to vulnerable groups to explain the benefits of the codes and to address any concerns people may have as to their use. I am particularly pleased that this outreach programme includes the recruitment of 23 outreach champions to drive awareness at county level.These champions are recruiting volunteers involved in local organisations in practically every town and village to ensure all sectors of society are aware of and comfortable with Eircodes. They have reported a positive response to the introduction, with widespread interest in learning more about them. More than 1,200 volunteers in more than 550 local organisations have mobilised to reach out to people in their local communities, including GAA clubs and community alert, active retirement and rural transport groups. These volunteers have assisted more than 8,000 people and are planning to reach thousands more in the weeks and months ahead. Local briefings, print materials and electronic information have been provided to community, voluntary and civil society groups at national and local level. Information leaflets will be available in citizens information centres. This effort is providing further assistance and ensuring greater understanding of the new system among vulnerable groups. Eircodes are not compulsory, no one will have to pay for them and they will be rolled out automatically. Citizens do not need to take any specific action once an Eircode has been received through the letter box. The final significant element of the project is the enactment of this legislation, which will ensure members of the public can have absolute confidence regarding data protection. Given the tight timeframe for completion of this project and the substantial commitments which had been entered into around communications and a signalled launch date during the summer, I regret it has not been possible to facilitate pre-legislative scrutiny. The primary purpose of this legislation is to enshrine the highest protection within the postcode system. It also provides the clearest possible reassurance that all personal data will remain secure. My Department has consistently taken a strong line on data protection in the design, implementation and operation of the project. This position is also reflected in the contract with Capita. As Minister, I have decided that this approach should be confirmed in primary legislation to ensure the greatest level of protection for citizens. My Department has had ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner and has completed a comprehensive privacy impact assessment. The Bill provides a sensible and pragmatic approach to data protection as it
relates to postcodes. It sets out the high level principles underpinning a protective framework, striking a balance between ensuring the commercial viability of postcodes, while underpinning data protection. I will now address the text of the Bill, which is divided into three sections. Sections 1 and 3 contain standard preliminary provisions and definitions. Section 2 contains the main provisions, sets out the amendments to the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 and outlines requirements for the use of postcodes. It provides a statutory footing for specified legitimate postcode activities, which are fundamental to the establishment and implementation of the postcode project. Section 66 also provides additional safeguards for the legitimate interests of owners and occupiers of properties by providing the Minister with powers to set down requirements that businesses must satisfy before they can be granted a licence to use a postcode database to provide value added services. Value added services are products or services that use or are derived from a postcode database. This provision enables the Minister to ensure that those who sell such services, known as value added resellers or VARs, are screened against specific criteria before they can use postcode databases. This section also provides the Minister with the power, by regulation, to require the postcode contractor to include certain specific provisions in the licences it grants to value added resellers. This enables the Minister to ensure there is a robust legal contract governing the manner in which value added resellers use postcode databases, including protections such as audit rights and sanctions such as suspension and termination of licences. In addition, the postcode contractor will only grant a licence to a value added reseller or end user where it can be demonstrated that the VAR has registered with the appropriate data protection regulator, if this is required. Section 66B introduces a specific obligation for the postcode contractor and value added resellers to publish a privacy notice. This requires specific information to be made readily available to individuals on how postcodes will be used and to whom they may be licensed. It also sets out individual rights with a view to enabling the creation of a clear and transparent data protection framework. Section 66C provides for the amendment of the principal Act to clarify that certain legitimate postcode activities may be undertaken in compliance with the Data Protection Acts. The scope of these legitimate postcode activities has been kept deliberately narrow. It covers the fundamental functions of the postcode system, including the development and maintenance of the postcode system, dissemination of postcodes, matching of addresses and licensing and reselling of the postcode address database. The Minister is also to be given the power to make regulations specifying new legitimate postcode activities. The Minister will be required to consult the Data Protection Commissioner and Minister for Justice and Equality before making any regulations in this respect. Section 66C only applies to legitimate postcode activities undertaken by the postcode contractor, the Minister or value added resellers. Consequently, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 apply fully as regards the processing of personal data by end users or others. Section 66D sets out the complaints procedure regarding postcodes and establishes adequate steps to safeguard the legitimate interests of owners and occupiers of properties. Section 66E imposes a further statutory obligation on the postcode contractor to develop a data retention policy to ensure decommissioned postcodes are retained for record keeping purposes. This legislation will copper-fasten the highest level of data protection to the postcodes project, ensuring the confidence of citizens and commercial entities in the roll-out, implementation and operation of the system. In the interests of providing certainty to all market players, enabling the development of fair competition among value added resellers and enhancing the protection of postcode users, it is important that the most appropriate data protection framework is put in place swiftly. I look forward to hearing the views of Members on this important Bill. I also look forward to the launch of our national postcode in the summer, as scheduled. I commend the Bill to the House.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill. I do so in substitution for my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, who is unable to attend the debate. In 2006, the then Commissioner for Data Protection, Mr. Billy Hawkes, warned that a code which identifies unique addresses instead of wider areas would pose data protection problems. He stated that individual post codes for each dwelling could be used for any purpose, including the provision of State services and commercial exploitation. In the 2013 annual report, the Data Protection Commissioner noted that his serious concern about the code had "since turned into a reality with the Minister’s announcement on the 8th October 2013 that Cabinet had agreed to the roll-out of the unique seven digit character code to every letter box in the State by 2015." In this context, the Minister has introduced the Bill to ensure the processing of any personal data in post code enabled databases is in compliance with the Data Protection Act. From that perspective, the Fianna Fáil Party welcomes the Bill and we will support it. As I noted, the legislation aims to address the serious deficiencies identified previously regarding privacy and data protection fears ahead of the planned introduction of the new post code system, Eircode, later this year.Before going into the contents of the Bill, I wish to raise a point as a postmaster myself. I was disappointed, as were a number of people, that the Government did not award the contract for the implementation of postcodes to the An Post network. Even in the last 12 months since he was elevated to his current office, the Minister will have heard support across all political parties for maintaining and enhancing the An Post network. Given the fact An Post delivers mail to every house with a next day delivery rate of 98% and it had the national geographical directory which, I understand, the Department has instructed it to make available to Capita in preparation for the roll out of Eircode, the failure to award An Post the contract is regrettable. Unlike other European countries, particularly France, we sometimes stick rigidly to a very basic tendering process where best price wins out. Conditions are not always put in place whereby the common good and what is best for the maintenance of State-owned companies and what would give them the best return must be considered. There is a worry because Capita has won this tendering process. In the UK, Capita is involved in the broadcasting charge and runs schemes similar to those run by An Post for the National Treasury Management Agency. There is a great fear in An Post and the IPU, the union representing postmasters, which I bring to the Minister's attention. As Capita has a foot in the door and access to every postal address in the State, it may be best placed to implement the broadcasting charge the Government will implement in the not too distant future. My guess is that it will be introduced in eight months. There is a fear which the Minister needs to take on board. An Post feels very aggrieved about the manner in which the Government is supporting it to ensure it has a sustainable future. The Minister alluded in his opening address to the fact that the idea of postcodes was initiated in 2004 and 2005 but for various reasons, it was pushed out. This is one of the few countries in the world that does not have a postcode system. The reason we have not had a postcode system to date may be because of the size of the country. We have a population of 4.5 million people and 2.2 million addresses, between 30% and 35% of which are non-unique addresses. That is where An Post has played such a pivotal role historically. The local postman or postwoman knew intimately where every townland was. One could name ten townlands in my own area and no one would know where they were unless he or she had a good knowledge of the locality. There is a concern about the fact that the new Eircode system is a non-sequential code system. I understand that houses which are close to each other will not have similar postcodes. According to freight companies and some of the emergency services, this could lead to mass confusion.  It is very worrying that freedom of information documents show that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources went against the advice of a private consultancy company and a State-appointed postcode board when it approved the design of Eircode. Why was that? It is very important to know. The new Eircode system has not been sufficiently tested and the random nature of postcodes is a serious problem for a new structure. While I have indicated that Fianna Fáil will support the Bill, it is not too late to review the plan for Eircode to consult with freight companies and the emergency services and to ensure that a system that has not been tested - the Minister may correct me if I am wrong - is fit for purpose. If the debacle of Irish Water has taught us anything it is that we should be 100% confident and sure of a system before implementing it. That a consultant was engaged to do a job and the Department acted contrary to the advice of that consultant is something we need to see addressed in the very near future. The Freight Transport Association estimates that the introduction of Eircode will cost the industry €80 million and that is if just 5% of small and medium businesses adopt it. This is based on the assumption that any business that adopts the postcodes will need to pay up to €5,000 for an Eircode database on top of the cost of updating its own customer accounts payable and accounts received database to ensure it is compliant with the new system. The new system will be of no use to the association's members because the code generated for each address is random meaning the codes for adjacent properties bear no relation to each other. The Irish Fire and Emergency Services Association says that because the codes are non-sequential and bear no relation to neighbouring locations, errors by users could go unnoticed as well as cause confusion. Such confusion may be catastrophic in terms of sending services to the wrong locations. Comparing Eircode to the sequential codes used in the North where emergency staff are used to postcodes that can often be learned and predictable allowing them to find localities easily from memory, the association claims that Eircode does not offer that capability and will not be visible on street signs to help the public raise the alarm. As I have said, freedom of information documents reveal that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources went against the advice of a private consultancy company and a State-appointed postcode board when it approved the design of Eircode. Eircode is a world first in assigning a random code to every address in the country which, its proponents claim, will tackle Ireland's high number of non-unique rural addresses. Critics claim, however, that it will be of less use to the public and private companies as the random codes will not identify clusters of addresses, a benefit of hierarchical codes such as that in use in the UK. Ireland has many similarities to the UK in terms of settlement patterns. We have our large towns and our small villages, although Ireland may have more isolated rural dwellings. I have a fear that because the new Eircode system being advocated by the Government will not have similar postcodes for houses in close proximity to each other, it will cause confusion.I hope the Minister will take this into consideration and that he will review the decision on implementation. The tender was originally awarded to Capita. An Post had grievances with regard to the allocation of the tender considering its own track record in next-day delivering to all houses the length and breadth of the country. I put the Minister on notice that the Irish Postmasters Union has significant reservations about the level of priority afforded by the Government to the network. We are conscious that if more services are not put our way then the network will not be viable in the future. That is the cornerstone for any community but in particular for communities in rural Ireland. While I have deviated slightly from a discussion of the Bill, for which I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, I want to use the opportunity to raise the issue of the Department of Social Protection new application forms for social welfare payments in which it identifies the best methods of payment. It advises customers: The Department recommends direct payment to your current, deposit or savings [account] in a financial institution. This is the best payment option for you as you can receive your payment at a time and a place that suits you. The account must be held in your name or jointly held by you.If we are talking about protecting our post office network, how can the Minister with responsibility for the An Post network protect a service when another arm of the State is recommending to people methods of payment that will take away the key service provided by An Post which is the administration of social welfare payments? I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this but now that he is aware of it he needs to talk to his Cabinet colleague, the leader of his party and the Minister for Social Protection, so that she can instruct the Department of Social Protection to stop recommending these methods of payment. The service was put out to tender and An Post fairly won the tender to continue paying social welfare payments for another number of years. Customers should not now be advised to transfer to electronic transfer payment. There should not be a line on the social welfare application forms advising them that the best way to get their social welfare payment is by means of a bank or a building society. I appreciate the lenience of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I will conclude. I welcome the Bill which will clarify the issue of data protection. It is very important that people have confidence in the protection of their data. I note the concerns raised when the Government sought PPS numbers for the refund of the water charges and the justifiable uproar that caused. People were afraid of sharing a critical piece of personal information. This Bill clarifies that critical pieces of personal information will not be shared. I assume this has been confirmed by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. We are happy to support the Bill with a caveat concerning issues identified by the Irish freight industry and the emergency services with regard to the non-sequential post codes which they believe will create extra expense and chaos. The system has not been tried and tested and I hope that it will not spiral out of control like Irish Water. 
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	It must have been about the early 2000s, long before I had any ambition or intention of coming to this place that I first heard in the news that Ireland was to have a postcode system. I thought that made obvious sense. I certainly did not think, back then, that I would be standing here today and saying to the Minister that I will not be able to support this potentially good idea. I need to outline the reasons I cannot offer that support. Either the Minister or I, if we were taking on the portfolio he took on, would probably have asked the same questions I will ask. Discussion of a postcode system has probably been going on for at least 12 or 15 years. In theory it is a fairly simple concept. A system is required so that a vehicle, a person, a parcel or a letter, can get to an address in Ireland. There are several standard satnav systems and we all use them to help us to get from place to place. There are 31% unique addresses but there are different ways to handle those addresses. The original cost figure for the proposed system was €27 million. A package was available from at least one Irish company which the company offered for free. That offer was turned down for some reason. The figure of €27 million is a gross understatement, in my view, because when I asked for some information about how the records of the various Departments that will use this system would be made ready to use the Eircode codes, I will describe some of the responses I received but it is clear that money will need to be spent to get Departments in a position to use Eircode. I asked what business problem or gap required such a complex non-standard - this is what we are talking about - addressing system. That is the first question that any business needs to ask. What problem am I trying to address by introducing this technology? If it is expensive technology one needs to have a very clear answer to that question. I have asked many times and I have not been able to get an answer to that very simple question. What business problem is being addressed and can only be addressed by a non-standard numbering sequence in a geo-locator system? I have been unable to get an answer to that most fundamental of questions. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has projected the cost to the State of the project will be in the region of €27 million, although others have projected an even higher cost. When a project with a technical specification is being carried out it is an attempt to fix a clear problem that has been identified. I agree with the high level of discussion about the lack of a postcode system in Ireland.I have not got an answer as to why an expensive, extensive and complex system such as this is being introduced. Although we are told Ireland is the only OECD country without a postcode system, that is not a good enough reason to spend so much money while overlooking technology and systems that are currently available, particularly if one of those systems is being offered for free. There is a risk that this is an expensive vanity project. I can understand Ministers, politicians, civil servants and citizens feeling embarrassed that we are the only OECD country without a postcode system. However, I do not believe we need such a system to extend as far as the Government has brought it with this incarnation.  As the Minister has probably heard me say before, the role of management consultants constitutes another risk. Typically, management consultants would work with a business and would know what the business wanted to get from new technology. The consultants might help the business define its requirements more precisely and would thus be in a support role, putting into words the problem the business wanted to solve. Once that had been signed off, there would be a different set of consultants to translate the business requirements into a set of specifications, identifying the solution to the problem. The reason for having two separate sets of consultants is clear; it is to avoid the Stockholm syndrome of the management consultancy world, whereby the consultants are making the decisions even though somebody in the civil service is signing off on it. For very obvious reasons, multiple stages of the process, including identifying the problem, defining the requirements, preparing the functional side and how it is going to look, preparing the technical specifications, preparing the request for tenders, issuing the tenders, evaluating the tenders when they come back, doing the coding and implementing the system, should never, ever be done by the same set of management consultants. The Minister knows that cannot be right and knows the risks involved in having one company, or individuals from one company, involved all the way through this process. It is the gift that keeps on giving in the management consultancy world. When I was speaking to some of the senior civil servants on this, although I cannot be sure, I believe I detected that they felt a less complex system would have done the job just as well. Satellite navigation companies such as Garmin work and are available. The expected cost of consultation on the project is projected to be in the region of €1.8 million. I have explained the advisability of breaking up the work among management consultants. The cost to several Departments to prepare their systems to use Eircode remains undisclosed. Also unanswered is the question I put to a number of Departments as to how their operation will differ and how they will be able to work better with their records converted for Eircode. I asked a question of the Minister for Social Protection as to what the projected cost of implementing Eircode in her Department would be. In fact, I asked a lot of Departments, but got a response from the Minister for Social Protection. I will quote the response:The initial phase will be completed in 2015. To this end, the project governance committee of the Department has approved the issue of a supplementary request for tender to a framework of approved bidders in order to implement the technical changes required to the IT systems of the Department. The associated costs of this initial phase will be known on completion of this technical work. Although this response is not very clear, I think I know what it means, and what it would mean to a management consultant. Given all the people in receipt of social welfare, children's allowance and the whole range of social protection payments, the Department has a huge number of records that will need to be updated. If each of those now has to be allocated a random number, it will be a huge task. I know what is involved in converting computer records. There are duplicates and triplicates and it is a great effort. I believe the Minister for Social Protection is being fully truthful when she says she is not in a position to estimate precisely the cost of this work. Here we are, launching Eircode to help Government agencies do their work better. Nobody has explained how that is going to happen, and we do not know how much it will cost the Government and the people for those agencies to get their systems up to a stage at which they can start using Eircode.  The Freight Transport Association of Ireland has raised serious concerns and has said it will not use the system. It is no use to them because it is not sequential; they cannot plan a journey around the order of deliveries. If it is no good to the people who are delivering the parcels here, there and everywhere, it is difficult to see how it can be of great benefit to the private market, apart from those marketers who want to send out flyers and that sort of thing. I believe the HSE and the local authorities have said that it can and will work, yet the Irish Fire and Emergency Services Association, which represents front-line staff, has expressed serious concerns about the system because it does not identify small local areas. It will not be any help for emergency call-outs and accidents along the roads. The Eircode numbers will not be up on the street signs. Unless the person making the emergency call happens to know his or her Eircode number and is able to call it out, it will be of no help to those services. I am concerned that a change in primary legislation is needed in order to ensure there is comprehensive data protection.To me, this says there is something fundamentally flawed with the system we are trying to put in. In a letter to the Minister, Digital Rights Ireland stated:  Our organization ... was happy to have been consulted by your officials and advisors in relation to the 'privacy impact assessment' for the eircode. We have deep concerns about the eircode initiative. In relation to this meeting, Oireachtas Debates records the following statement by one of your officials:As part of this [privacy impact assessment] we have spoken to many stakeholders. We have spoken to the National Consumer Agency, logistics companies and Digital Rights Ireland, with which we have had an in-depth conversation to see if there is anything in the proposal that might be considered to have an impact on anyone's privacy. Broadly, they are satisfied with what we are doing.An observer might infer from this factual statement that Digital Rights Ireland was among the organisations which were 'broadly satisfied'. We are assured that this implication was not intended, and we would like to state clearly that this is not the case. We want to state clearly that we are not at all 'satisfied' with the postcode that has been designed or the implementation proposals. Our view is that you are taking a dangerous and needless step into the unknown by going ahead with the code as currently proposed. We gave details of an immediate privacy problem that will present itself immediately after launch. We warned that the mitigating measures that the Department is proposing would not really help, and might even be a distraction from other critical project issues. We warned that the legal protections of the data protection regime would be largely unenforceable in the context of global Internet advertising networks. Although 'eircode' is by no means the first postcode in the world to use code down to the individual house level, it is the first postcode anywhere to use this unstructured pseudo-random design. Simple changes would bring eircode into line with international best practice and would greatly alleviate the privacy concerns. Risks would still exist, but they could be managed and mitigated.The letter goes on a little further, but right the way through is the message that Digital Rights Ireland continues to have very serious concerns over data protection in regard to the Eircode system. Although I and my party will oppose the Bill today, mathematics being mathematics, it will go through. However, I and my party will certainly be putting down amendments at a later stage. I have probably said enough. I have been unable to establish what is the business problem that needed such a complex software system to address it. I do not understand how currently available software and a company that could have provided it were turned down, although the company offered it for free. I am very concerned at the role of management consultants throughout all the phases of this project. It is the gift that keeps on giving for management consultants. I am not saying it was abused but I am certainly arguing it was wide open to abuse and that the normal checks that should have been there were not there. I am very annoyed that the request for tenders was designed in such a way that small and medium enterprises in Ireland simply could not afford to submit tenders. I know a case was made to the EU on this and that, while it did not say there was a breach that would cause the tender process to be re-run, the EU did advise the Government that it should do it in a different way in future. I understand the EU is still in contact with the Department on that issue. Effectively, the design of the tender form precluded small Irish companies from tendering for this work, reinforcing what I was saying about the continuous involvement of management consultants through all of the phases of a project. I hope it works. This country needs a postcode system. However, we could have done it a lot more simply. If I had been in the Minister's place, I would have stopped what was an ill-conceived start. Everything the Minister goes to do will be flawed and it will cost this country an awful lot more money than we currently think it will. I believe it will cost us a small fortune to get all the records of the other Departments ready. It is a bit scary that the other Departments do not know how much it is going to cost but at least they are being truthful about the fact they do not know. Even at this late stage, I would have gone back to basics on this one. I would have taken the advice of the independent management consultants and the State-established body, which said we do not need this randomly assigned number and we do not need this complexity within the system, that there is an easier way to do it and that the technology is already there. I would have taken that advice and worked on it. I will be opposing the Bill, although I know it will pass despite my opposition. I will be submitting amendments on the next Stage.

#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	This Bill seeks to address data protection issues around the introduction of a postal code service. Data protection is in need of real safeguards, especially as the digital economy expands and the threat of surveillance and citizen scrutiny grows simultaneously with it. Embracing technological advances can seem intimidating, but the digital economy demands that we get smarter with our information. Ireland is the only European country and one of a few OECD countries that does not have a national postcode system of some kind, as the Minister outlined in his introduction. The introduction of this proposed system will change that completely, making Ireland the first country to have a system of unique postcodes. It is already cited as a world first and future-proofed, and despite a few objections to the introduction of this system, most people seem reasonably in favour. I understand that two models were up for consideration: a cluster-based, non-unique postcode system, similar to the one used in the UK, and a unique identifier system in which postcodes would consist of seven randomised characters assigned uniquely to each address in the State. The Department determined that the cluster-based, non-unique postcode system was not suitable for Ireland because of the exceptional situation in rural Ireland with regard to non-unique addresses, with up to 60% of addresses in rural areas being non-unique. In Donegal, for example, this includes situations in which there is more than one person in a townland with the same name and address and, as any Deputy from a rural constituency knows, the current system relies heavily on the use of local knowledge to deliver a letter, parcel or service. The more I look into this proposal, the less I see its relevance. I say this because the success of this system depends on the level of uptake among the business community and the population. However, there will be no legal obligation on private organisations or businesses to use Eircode, as it is known. An Post will not be making the use of the Eircode mandatory and expects never to make it mandatory. Furthermore, it is up to individuals themselves to use the code or not to use it. Because local knowledge has been an integral part of the delivery service, there will be confusion about adopting this code. While the routing key will be used to help sort mail, it is not directly linked to counties, towns or geographic features. Therefore, many people may be surprised that their code has no relation to their actual location and their neighbour might have an entirely different arrangement of numbers. While Donegal people might expect "DL" to be part of the code, this will not be the case.If this type of system is being used mainly to cater for the large number of non-unique addresses in rural Ireland, how does the Government expect the system to become the norm in service provision, which is reliant on addresses, and communities that are reliant on local knowledge? Concerns have been expressed that Eircode will not be any more helpful than traditional addresses in helping to find the scenes of accidents and incidents because each code will be randomly created. Unless a caller knows the postcode of the location they are in no nearby postcode will be of any use as it will not bear any relation to the one they are trying to direct emergency groups to. Some freight and courier firms have objected to the use of this code because their delivery system is based around a cluster system. They feel that when dealing with bulk deliveries a randomised code would not work alongside their information systems and that there would probably be compatibility problems in trying to interpret the database that will be available on the internet to find addresses and postcodes. Meath County Council has also objected to its introduction because it claims other already available information systems exist which are more appropriate to the work it does. For example, Loc8 is a service which can help locate illegal dumping and icy roads, which is vital information for local authorities. Other satellite versions can provide relevant information according to users. I welcome the introduction of technological advances to service provision, especially in our public services, as long as the service remains committed to the needs of the community. We do not want to see what is currently happening with An Post, where proposed innovative solutions in service provision are in fact disempowering a vital institution. The Government could commit more to working with the Irish Postmasters’ Union to promote its role in an ever-changing and modernising society. One such way is to engage in the development of a standard bank account to be provided through the network. This would initially need State funding. Considering the proposed cost of Eircode, I cannot see why a project like a standard bank account could not be supported as well. The previous Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said a Government sub-committee was set up to expand and develop the post office network and service. However, the Government’s move towards direct electronic transfer of welfare payments is a technological advancement which is disempowering a public service provider. In recent days, the Department of Social Protection has changed its forms for social welfare applications to direct people to avail of electronic payments to banks and move them away from post offices. How does that fit in with the views of the Minister and the sub-committee on post office services and how to develop and expand them? It does not fit and it moves those who are outside the banking system into it, which does not benefit them. It also undermines the roll-out of the standard bank account that has been approved by the Department of Finance, which has been reluctant to include the post office in the scheme. The Government's move towards electronic transfer payments is essentially removing this business from post offices and handing it to the commercial banks. Hundreds of offices will close if we move fully towards direct electronic transfer. This move also transfers the cost of the payment to welfare recipients, through bank charges, while collection is without cost at post offices. In terms of data protection, which the Bill addresses, the previous Data Protection Commissioner, Billy Hawkes, stated before he stepped down that he was concerned that a single code for each house risked possible data privacy breaches. There was a number of concerns that the code could be considered as part of an individual’s personal information. The unique seven character postcode goes beyond what is an address. Through the use of modern technology and big data, it can be easily assimilated into any sort of electronic device or dataset which could in turn be used for any purpose from State intervention to commercial profit. I am glad to see a provision in the Bill which places the requirement on the postal contractor and re-sellers to publish on their websites privacy notices informing the public of, amongst other things, the background to postcodes and the source of types of data included in the postcode databases. I also welcome the establishment of a complaints procedure by the postal contractor and the preparation of a code of practice concerning the retention of data related to postcode databases by the postal contractor. However, if we had not introduced such a unique system, all of the cumbersome administration to use a postcode system would not be required. There are downsides because the system will have to be policed and managed. There will probably be a large volume of complaints to the Data Protection Commissioner about the use or potential misuse of these codes. While this Bill is a positive attempt at modernising the post service, at closer inspection the application of the postcode model risks becoming redundant. I also question how the Government is thinking. Is it thinking local or global? Are we certain that Eircode will be relevant to rural dwellers? Will it be useful to them, especially when local knowledge is so much a part of the current system? If the Government is thinking globally then I feel this world-first and future-proof model risks missing the point if it is not picked up by enough stakeholders. Other less risky initiatives could make Ireland more modern and up-and-coming, such as investing widely in broadband, something we constantly raise in the House.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	We sometimes ask ourselves what we are doing here. Today is a very good example of that. We debated the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill earlier, for which citizens had to wait over four years. Many people are desperately seeking pieces of legislation which have been promised, such as the adoption tracing Bill and other areas where there has been no progress. We are discussing this Bill on a Thursday afternoon. The only reason it is necessary is the appalling design of the Eircode system and the fact that it will be administered by a private entity. The new Eircode system, which the Government seems intent on delivering, will furnish every household in Ireland with a seven digit unique identifier. This is a system quite unlike any other postcode system in use anywhere in the world. We are having this debate because of the serious privacy concerns around the idea of having a unique identifier, and this Bill is supposed to address the data protection concerns as a result of that. If the Government had not pursued the project in the first place, that would not have been necessary. Many Deputies have asked, very validly, why the Government is doing this. Freight industry representatives told an Oireachtas joint committee in November 2014 that as a national postcode Eircode lacks vision, imagination, ambition and, most of all, practicality. They said it was of no use to them and that there was no logic to it, and described it as being like another Irish Water. An Post has said it will continue to deliver without Eircode. The chairman of the Irish Fire and Emergency Services Association has said that the codes may be catastrophic in terms of sending emergency services to the wrong location. If it is not compulsory to use the codes, if the emergency services are not enthusiastic about them and the kinds of business the codes are supposed to make life easier for do not want them, why are we doing it? This is costing €27 million for a private multinational company, Capita, to implement. Many schools, individuals and projects would desperately want and need €27 million to engage in work or offset the difficulties resulting from the cutbacks in delivering services. I do not see where we are going with this. There are very serious privacy concerns around the issue. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in its 2013 annual report stated as much because, as it said, it can be easily assimilated into sort of electronic device or data set which could, in turn, be used for any purpose ranging from State services to commercial exploitation, which is a major issue. The Minister and Government have said that they have engaged repeatedly with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner over their concerns, but I am not sure this Bill overcomes those concerns or issues regarding people's data and privacy. As Deputy Colreavy said, Digital Rights Ireland has consistently said it has deep concerns about the privacy implications of Eircode. There is no doubt that one of reasons for this would inevitably be the fact that it has been handled by Capita. Let us examine this, because it is part of this Government having become wedded to privatisation and outsourced companies. Capita is a large company with an annual turnover of just under €5 billion last year. It is not a charity. The Eircode system will be run with the same type of profit-making efficiency under which these companies operate.The public will end up paying €27 million to a massive multinational conglomerate to design a postcode system that has been roundly criticised by everybody and one we do not have to use in the first place. One could not make this lunacy up. Small businesses, if they want to use it, will have to pay. There have been many reassurances that the amount they have to pay will not be much. I will put that back to the Minister in two ways. First, €180 per ten users per year for access just to addresses - not the longitudinal or latitudinal information - is not cheap for simple database access. Second, what assurances do we have that these prices will not go up? The Minister does not control Capita. What obligation is there under this system to make it cheap and accessible to users, not to mind the fact that ordinary citizens can look up no more than 15 Eircodes per day before they will have to start paying for access? As we do not have any real guarantees around pricing, then it is possible that Eircodes will give an advantage to large businesses and so forth. One of the significant problems with this is the issue of the Eircodes being proprietary, which is absolute lunacy and against all best practice. At the end of the ten-year contract, the State will presumably have to buy back the database of addresses or put it out to tender to another company. Nobody but Capita can scrutinise, use or build on the database it has built to improve it and make more efficient. Any changeover at the end of the contract will be difficult, as the next contract holder will have to spend a large amount of money to get it working up to speed. Accordingly, why is this database not an open source, which is the norm in these cases? Open-source software is robust, popular and more transparent. Why are we implementing a brand new system using proprietary software? The company in charge of this system, Capita, is well-known in Britain as a byword for inefficiency. The satirical magazine Private Eye christened the company “Crapita” as a result of its appalling work, yet we are giving €27 million of taxpayers’ money to it. For example, the Vale of White Horse District Council in Oxfordshire outsourced its finance function to Capita at a cost of £9.1 million. In the ensuing chaos, staff did not get paid, councillors did not get their expenses reimbursed, and the council was threatened with having its electricity cut off. Capita developed Birmingham City Council’s website but the delivery was three years late and more than 300% over budget. Capita was responsible for the disastrous Criminal Records Bureau, which assigned criminal records to thousands of people who had never had them in the first place. It also overran the budget by £150 million. The UK education Minister claimed it was responsible for schools not opening because they were not able to vet teachers properly. When it took over Lambeth’s housing benefit section in a ten-year contract, after four years there was a backlog of 55,000 claims, with up to 100 people made homeless by the company’s failure to process their claims on time. Seriously, why are we here today looking at the contract to facilitate this private company when we already have an open postcode system? It is a waste of money and time. There are far better projects to pursue with €27 million than handing it over to a private multinational company with a record like this.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	It is difficult to say yet what the long-term implications will be of using the unique code to identify each individual house in the State. Based on my reading of the Bill, the introduction of the postcode system has some merits, not least the unique identifier which will allow ambulances and other emergency services to get to an address quickly. Precious minutes could be saved in matters of life and death, particularly in rural areas. There is no doubt that the identifier will also be of significant benefit to State services, making it easier for the Revenue Commissioners, for example, to collect taxes and other charges. I imagine Irish Water will welcome access to such a database with open arms. With regards to privacy, I am not satisfied, like other Members, that the concerns of the Data Protection Commission about individual house coding have been adequately addressed. The requirements for the code were revised without consultation in 2010. There is merited concern that modern technology could be used to create dataset information on people’s addresses which could be used for many purposes, including for State services and for commercial exploitation. This is not acceptable. The awarding of individual codes to each address is contrary to advice given by the Data Protection Commissioner. Will the Minister clarify whether the move from the original proposal for an area-based code to an individual code was driven by commercial pressures? It appears to me that this may very well be the case. What has been proposed in this country is unprecedented anywhere else in the world. The argument has repeatedly been made by the Government that an area-based postcode would not necessarily raise major data protection issues. Has a full privacy impact assessment been carried out to assess these implications? If not, will the Minister carry out such an assessment? It is a reasonable request from those in the Opposition. It is still not too late to lock the stable door after the horse has bolted. How much has been spent on consultants on this project? Is the consultant spend separate from the €25.6 million we have been told will be the overall cost? My information says it is. Why is further expertise, above the €25.6 million figure, necessary to oversee a system that we are told is ready to roll out?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	A key legacy of this Government will be the privatisation - or, as it is more politely called, the external service delivery - of our public services. In the four years since the coalition took the reins, we have witnessed the outsourcing of countless essential health care services, said goodbye to the State’s share in our national airline and stood over the privatisation of Bord Gáis, to name but a few. Added to this, the indiscriminate cutting of essential services through austerity measures has left many people with no real option but to turn to the private sector. Irish properties are being sold by NAMA way below their value to vulture funds from the US which very often turn them over shortly afterwards for ridiculous profits, while 100,000 people wait for scant social housing. This legislation proposes to effectively privatise the national address system. One matter on which we can commend the Government is its dedication to consistently upholding its neoliberal philosophy and programme. According to the Minister’s response to a parliamentary question I tabled last week, the company awarded the tender for the national address system, Capita Business Support Services Ireland, has been paid €12 million, excluding VAT, to date for the development and roll-out of Eircode. The Minister stated that the contract is expected to cost €16 million, excluding VAT, in total, plus €1.2 million a year for the remainder of the licence period, amounting to €27 million in total for implementation. These figures do not include the millions of euro spent on consultations on this issue since 2003. The Freight Transport Association of Ireland estimates €80 million to be a more realistic overall cost. Will the Minister confirm his figures for this? The frenzied selling off of public goods has been touted by this Administration as a good in itself, a cost-cutting measure that will increase efficiency and improve standards of delivery.SIPTU disagrees, but its warnings that outsourcing could actually result in higher costs on the Exchequer have fallen on deaf ears. Capita Ireland is part of a £7 billion multinational corporation, a company which over the past decade has made a sport out of collecting Government contracts in the UK. Capita has almost completely taken over local council service provision in the London borough of Barnet and in doing so will conveniently not have to put up with the same kind of scrutiny as democratic government. Training courses, which under the local authority would have been provided in-house for minimal cost, are now carried out by Capita at much higher prices. For example, a day’s training for one person on the taking of minutes now costs the taxpayer in the Barnet area £800. Last week, Aditya Chakrabortty wrote, in an article in The Guardian addressing this issue:[That] an arm of Britain’s local government has in effect agreed to a friendly takeover by a £7bn multinational. Whoever Barnet residents vote for in local elections, they will always get Capita. Whenever they phone or email or visit, they will speak to a Capita employee. The FTSE giant will face no competition for the next decade; nor will it endure the same scrutiny as democratic government, as previously public information is veiled under “commercial sensitivity”. I hope the Minister is a little concerned that the private sector would not always deliver quite as well for the citizen as the public sector. James Meek, in describing the situation in the UK, could have easily been referring to Ireland when he stated:The privatisation, disaggregation and foreign takeover of Britain’s universal networks since Thatcher has enabled the great lie of the post-Thatcher era, that tax has fallen, when in reality the tax burden has simply been shifted from progressive taxes on income, where the wealthy pay more, to the flat fees for private universal networks such as water, energy and transport, where the poorer pay more. The original principle of universal networks - that society as a whole would provide a service for everyone, through a levy proportionate to each citizen’s means - has been turned on its head. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the Eircode venture is the fact that millions of euro of taxpayers’ money is being pumped into a system that will be inaccessible to many people. The randomised sequencing of the postcodes, which is not done in any other European country, means that to make sense of an Eircode, a user will have to pay to access a commercially licensed database. Like many services in the country, this is all fine if one can afford to pay. Big business is favoured while the SMEs lose out. Furthermore, as the service is not compulsory, many people will not bother using it. Several industry players have identified Eircode as having little, if any, added value. In fact, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, which represents 200 freight businesses, has stated it will not use Eircode. Luckily for the Government, it can justify its decisions by the fact that there was some manner of consultation process on Eircode, but how can a consultation process be in any way meaningful if the advice of the State-appointed national postcodes project board and private consultancies for a hierarchical postcode system is ignored? The 2010 report on postcodes by the Oireachtas joint committee called for a self-financing public code. Again, this was ignored. We have seen this in the case of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, which is going through the House. God knows how it will turn out, but it is very hard for us to be optimistic. An Post has named Eircode a "20th century solution to a 21st century problem". Surely this €27 million, or up to €80 million if the cost of consultants is included, could have been more effectively allocated. With 220 post offices having been closed down in Ireland since 2006, more support could be given to the rural communities which have been abandoned. What good is some random postcode to an elderly person who due to post office closures has to try to find a lift to pick up his or her pension? In April, I addressed the issues of the post offices with the Minister. In his reply he stated that he was conscious of the importance of a vibrant post office network. He also stated that we must ensure that post office network services are commercially viable as well as socially significant. I do not do parish pump politics. I do not even have clinics, but people contact my office here from villages such as Tomhaggard, Pallas, Crossabeg, Ballymurn, Gusserane, Ballycarney, Ballyhoe, Castledockrell, Duncormick, Ballymitty and Rathnure. They want to know why, if the Minister believes what he said in his reply to me, he does not reopen their post offices. I am firmly of the belief that it would not cost a fortune to do so. I agree that doing so would probably not make money, but would it provide a very worthwhile service? It probably would, and it would mean a lot to these people. The Minister does not need me to tell him, even though he lives in Dublin, as I do most of the time, that rural communities are struggling to survive. The post office means a lot to them, particularly older people who have less access to computers and banking. As we know, the banks are far more geared towards and focused on turning profits than providing services. The day of the bank providing a service is long gone and the post office can fill this role well. It may be said that not every community needs one and that one cannot be put everywhere because it is not economically sustainable, and that while they are good socially, if they are not economically sustainable it is not possible to keep them all open, but I would like the Government to look at what it would cost to do so. I know An Post has a mandate not to lose money, but the Government has a mandate to provide a service to the people. I would like the Government to look at the prospect of reopening the post offices it has closed and see what it would cost and if it could afford to do so, because we make choices and it is not that we do not have any money. I know money does not grow on trees, even if it is made from paper, although plastic is used a bit more now, but a post office network represents value for money in a social sense. The Government did not start this - Fianna Fáil did - and I would not blame the Government one bit for not taking lectures from Fianna Fáil on this, because it closed more post offices than the Government, but if the Government would examine this and ask whether it could afford to reopen the post offices, it would be brilliant.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	The Bill we are discussing is a follow-up consolidation and amendment of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011. It will achieve a number of fundamental objectives. It will ensure personal data is fully protected during and after the implementation and licensing of the new national postcode system. The Bill will provide a statutory footing for specified legitimate postcode activities which are fundamental to the establishment and implementation of the postcode project. It provides additional safeguards for the legitimate interests of owners and occupiers of properties. It does this by providing the Minister with powers to set down requirements that businesses must satisfy before they can be granted a licence to use the postcodes. It also provides owners and occupiers of properties with a right to correction of any inaccurate information held in a postcode database, and there is also an appeals system. It provides clarity to the user of the postcode database with regard to fair processing and accuracy. It will effectively mean the operation of the new postal code system will be in compliance with the Data Protection Acts 1983 to 2003.Ireland is the only country in the European Union without a postcode system and this legislation will bring it in line with European and international markets. It is a modernising exercise and it reflects the contemporary situation in most countries. The need for it is emphasised by the fact that 35% of our addresses are not unique. In townlands where there is a multiplicity of the same name or where there are variations of townland names, confusion is created. It is vital as a modernising exercise. Capita Business Support Services was awarded a ten-year contract in 2013 to develop and implement a national postcode system. Its overall aim is to ensure that by 2015 every address in Ireland will receive a unique Eircode, a seven-character code comprising letters and numbers. It will also support a launch and awareness campaign. There are some reservations about the plan, such as those set out by Deputy Mick Wallace, but while he put forward an interesting critique of the proposal he proposes no solutions to deal with any of the issues. I do not see how he can suggest an alternative method of doing this other than by bringing in a company like Capita. The main issue in this legislation is data protection. I will briefly address the legislation before making a few points about post offices. Section 66A of the legislation states that the Minister of the day has the power to set down specific requirements for any business or company which seeks to use the new postcode database. Subsection (1) states that the Minister can decide to attach specific conditions to a licence granted to a postcode contractor which will ensure that the privacy of the owners and occupiers of the individual property is safeguarded. Privacy is at a premium and data protection legislation and this legislation allow the Minister to support that objective. There is also the option for any individual to correct inaccurate information held within the postcode database. There are also reservations around the future of An Post in light of these changes. The regulatory impact analysis carried out on the legislation found that, although the new legislation will permit competitors to enter the market through open competition, it is likely that An Post will continue to be what we all want it to be - a dominant player in the letter post market for the immediate future. The national postcode project board found that the introduction of postcodes would increase mail volume, which is a positive finding in light of the legitimate fear for our post offices. The postcodes will facilitate the location of all addresses that are non-unique. They will make it easier for consumers to shop online and will assist the development of Irish online commerce. Online shopping and e-trading are very important. They are very much part of the landscape and we have to be able to participate as it is crucial for our economic development that we modernise our economy. This will allow for a better delivery of public services, particularly the emergency services, and testimonials from the emergency services support that thesis. Some 35% of addresses in Ireland are not unique. In the constituency I have the privilege of representing, Cavan-Monaghan, we have a lot of the same names for areas and a lot of confusion around addresses, and this makes for difficulties in the form of late deliveries and wrong deliveries, which the postcodes will alleviate. I welcome this legislation for the fact that it will modernise the delivery system in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. Despite what Deputy Wallace said, Nightline, a major courier service, has stated that it will greatly improve the prospects for its work. I am very concerned for the future of our post offices and I know the Minister, Deputy Alex White, is extremely proactive on this issue. Some 3,700 people work in the post office sector, including 700 local postmasters. They are, in effect, local SMEs and they are very important. I ask the Minister and the Cabinet to ensure we deliver social welfare payments through the post offices and to look into whether post offices could be equipped with a banking function. It is crucial for this country, not only the towns and villages but big cities too, that we preserve our post offices and make them viable. Although not specific to the legislation, this is very much relevant to the entire debate, and I would like the Minister to address the future of post offices in his reply. I am very anxious to preserve all our post offices in Cavan-Monaghan.  This Government has a very good record on post offices, contrary to the distortions and propaganda for which certain people are responsible. It is sad to close even one post office, but we have closed only approximately 20 post offices nationally, in contrast to the previous administrations, which closed over 200. Thankfully, closures have been at a minimum in Cavan-Monaghan, although there have been a few which we greatly regret. Post offices are always painful to lose. They are central to the fabric of our communities and the post office is the lifeblood of our community. Rather than closing post offices, I would like us to reopen some that have been closed and maintain the viability of the ones that remain.

We talk about job creation, but job retention is of equal importance, and if we can preserve the 3,700 people working in our post office network it will be a wonderful achievement. I hope we can do that and that we can add services to our post offices. I consider it a priority for Government and I am anxious to be reassured on that score.

Since we took over, only 22 post offices have closed nationwide. The Longford-Westmeath constituency backs up this statistic. Since 2011 there has been no post office closure in either county, whereas over the three-year period from 2005 to 2008, Fianna Fáil managed to close six offices in Westmeath and three in Longford. Deputy Troy also asked the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to stop sending out letters from her Department with a clear recommendation to use commercial banks in preference to using the post offices. Once again, the Deputy is a few weeks behind with his remarks. A number of weeks ago, Granard, Newtownforbes, Kilbeggan and other post offices alerted me to the existence of these letters. I went directly to the Minister and raised my strong concerns. I then criticised the letters, and this was well documented in local media. Following my representations to the Minister, Deputy Burton, and my vocal criticism, she made clear to me in late March that no more such letters would be issued. Therefore, I suggest the Deputy refrain from asking the Minister to stop sending out letters that have already ceased to exist. He should perhaps take a leaf out of my book and request that the Department of Social Protection write to all individuals who received these letters, clearly outlining the limitations and restrictions that their local banks have put in place when it comes to accessing their pension payments. This would be a more constructive approach to take. This legislation essentially sets out to protect personal data during and after the implementation and licensing of the new national postcode system, which is due to be rolled out during the summer. There has been much discussion about the possible benefits and downsides to the introduction of the new Eircode system. I believe the benefits of the system outweigh any potential negatives. Those of us who are supportive of Eircode will argue that the new system will bring benefits to consumers, businesses and rural communities while improving the delivery of public services. It will become easier to shop online, which has the knock-on effect of progressing the development of Irish online commerce. Eircode will also make it easier for emergency services to locate addresses, particularly in rural areas.As a rural Deputy, I have come across many instances in which emergency vehicles have lost valuable minutes trying to find the location of a rural home. The introduction of Eircode will be of huge benefit to emergency services. Rural and urban homes will receive a unique code, which means any emergency vehicle can easily find its way to an individual's home as quickly as possible. The director of the national ambulance service, Martin Dunne, alluded to this benefit when he said "Eircode will assist in the rapid identification of non-unique addresses." There are many such addresses throughout the country. At present, this Government is doing a lot to ensure we have a modern national infrastructure. The Minister is ensuring the roll-out of fibre broadband to rural areas and the upgrading of roads to our major urban centres, which means that communication links are becoming much stronger. Therefore, it makes sense that Ireland's postcode system follows these advances and upgrades to a modern and sustainable system. It will ensure there is greater accuracy when it comes to addresses. The days of explaining to delivery people or taxi drivers that they have to go through the crossroads, take the second left, turn right at the T-junction and the house is fourth on the right will be gone. Eircode will direct anybody directly to the front door thanks to a simple seven-digit code.  Eircode will also have a positive impact on business. To highlight rural Ireland once again, it is very common for townlands to have a number of households with the same surname. This has always provided a challenge with regard to the proper delivery of services to a rural location. Eircode plans to combat this through the provision of the unique identification numbers, which will cater for the 35% of addresses in Ireland without a name or a number. This will surely improve the logistics of a business in terms of optimising routes and delivery schedules. I urge all business owners to ensure they are properly prepared for Eircode. The amount of preparation will vary depending on the size of the business, but little things like displaying the business's Eircode on customer forms, websites, social media or anywhere the business address is shown will help ensure a business is prepared for Eircode. The success of Eircode for businesses will be as a result of the wide-ranging consultations that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has held with An Post, commercial delivery companies and other stakeholders to ensure that their needs and the needs of their customers are adequately matched. While I am on my feet, I will say that it is very important that we provide additional services at post offices. This would save the taxpayer a significant amount of money, estimated at somewhere in the region of €53 million. It would help businesses and save jobs. I am extremely anxious, as I have said time and again, to see rural post offices across the country maximised and strengthened. I know the Minister is working on this and I would like to see it happening. The Grant Thornton report on the future of the post office network in Ireland highlights the benefits of making motor tax payments, additional financial transactions, and household and hospital charges payable at post offices. This could save the country a great deal of money, it would bring real reform and it would strengthen the whole concept of the post office. It is very important that we increase the role of the post offices across the country. A post office is more than just a service; it is a community facility.People meet and congregate in post offices. This is an important part of the fabric of rural life, and such interaction needs to be developed and encouraged. The introduction of the new Eircode system will bring significant benefits to customers and businesses while improving the delivery of public services. The improving and upgrading of our infrastructure is a welcome move and will be extremely beneficial for our rural communities.

I have not had enough time to examine this legislation, but I am pretty concerned about it. I can see the case for having a postcode system that is uniform and allows people in business, or others who for any reason need to communicate with people or get to places, to find those places. I can see the logic of that, but I worry about the way we are doing this and the system that is being put in place. I am open to correction on certain aspects of it but, based on what I have seen and what I understand this to be about, I am quite concerned about it. The Minister, in his opening speech, said that Ireland was the only country in Europe that did not have a national postcode system. Fair enough, but we will now be the only country in Europe that has a national postcode system with individualised addresses. We are going from one extreme to the other. Already a number of people, including the Data Protection Commissioner, have raised concerns about data protection and privacy issues. I share those concerns. It all smacks a little too much of Big Brother. There will be a database with individualised addresses which will be controlled by a private multinational corporation. That is kind of Orwellian. I do not see why it is necessary. I understand the critics of this scheme say that the norm is to have postcodes based on clusters, not based on individualised addresses, and that is generally the case across Europe. The cluster model meets the requirement to have a standardised postcode system but it does not bring it right down to individualised addresses, with every dwelling or business having an individual postcode on a centralised database controlled by a multinational corporation. I am concerned about that aspect, and that is a concern that has been raised by the Data Protection Commissioner and others.  I understand the company, Capita, that will implement the system does not have a great history. I was informed - Deputy Daly may have said this earlier, and it is amusing in a way - that Private Eye dubbed this company "Crapita" because it made such a mess of other systems in which it was involved in the UK, where it mis-assigned people to certain categories and so on. That is not very encouraging now that this company has been awarded the contract. Small and medium enterprises have been very critical of the fact that they were excluded from the tendering process for the postcode system. The contractor to be awarded the project was required to have a turnover above a certain threshold. Domestic small and medium-sized enterprises that might have wanted to bid for the contract, as some of them did, were excluded from tendering for it, as I understand it, because of the tendering conditions. Instead, the contract was awarded to a big multinational. That seems unfair on those companies, and it would further add to my concerns in that we are placing the contract in the hands of an anonymous multinational over which we have very little control. The other aspect about which I am concerned is the charges that will apply. While householders are not to be charged at this stage, small businesses will be charged €10 a month. The officials might nod to affirm whether I am correct on that. There will be a charge for accessing the database to obtain more than a certain number of addresses or postcodes, which I believe is 15. One might say these are relatively modest fees, and there are none for ordinary householders at this stage, but will it stop at that? It is a little bit like water charges. Once the system is established, can the charges be increased, and if so, by how much? Could this become just another money-making racket at the expense of ordinary householders and small businesses? That would be a significant concern as well. Has the Government worked out an impact assessment with regard to employment among postmen or among staff of small businesses generally? I am concerned that this system is setting up the infrastructure to get rid of the local postman or woman - perhaps not immediately, but it lays the ground for that. It may be a sentimental view on my part, and I do not live in the countryside, but even out my way in Dún Laoghaire, the local postman or woman, who knows where people in the area live, is a human point of connection between one's family and the postal system. I like that, and I would not like to see it replaced. It is one of the characteristics of this country that is worth keeping and protecting. I wonder if this system essentially lays the basis for the privatisation, much more centralisation and so-called efficiency in the area of postal and parcel delivery and communications generally, which will ultimately usurp the local postman or woman. All of this will cost us €27 million. One wonders whether that is a good expenditure on something about which there has been significant concern and the benefits of which will substantially go to a multinational. Indeed, this seems intended to facilitate multinationals more generally in terms of postal communications. I am concerned and sceptical about this project as the Minister has presented it.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	In January, the Minister confirmed that the estimated cost of the Eircode project would be €27 million, excluding VAT. This includes the design, database upgrades, communications and postcode distribution. Data protection concerns surrounding the introduction of a national postcode system were highlighted by the former Data Protection Commissioner early in its development. In particular, a unique postcode can be considered to be part of an individual's personal data in certain circumstances. As a result of the use of modern technology and "big data", a postcode could be assimilated into an electronic device or dataset where it could be used for any purpose. The Minister has indicated that data protection concerns have led to the insertion of data protection provisions into the contract between him and the postcode contractor, Capita Ireland, and the drafting of the Communications Regulation (Postal Service) (Amendment) Bill 2015. The introduction of unique postcodes has received mixed responses from stakeholders. Some, such as An Post and Nightline, are fully supportive while others, such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, do not believe that it provides the optimal version of a national postcode system. Others like Digital Rights Ireland have continued to express concerns regarding policy issues such as data protection. The Bill will, therefore, provide a framework to address data protection concerns and pave the way for the implementation of Eircode later this summer. The implementation of Eircode will be accompanied by a public information campaign, which I welcome. Ireland is the only country in the EU and OECD that does not have a national postcode system. Eircode has been described as being far more than just a postcode. It has been dubbed a smart location code that will identify an individual address, rural or urban, and show exactly where it is located. Each postal address in the State, including apartments and businesses, will receive a unique postcode. This is in contrast to other countries where postcodes tend to define clusters or groups of addresses. I am glad to see that the relevant senior Minister, Deputy White, is present for the debate on this important project. He has stated that the introduction of Eircode will be a major advance, including for business and the community in general. In 2010, the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commented that there was an anomaly in the Commissioner's line of reasoning, in that urban dwellers were easily identified by way of house numbers and street names while rural dwellers were not so easily identified. The joint committee, the current version of which I am a member of, further commented that it was difficult to envision how the privacy of the urban dweller as well as the rural dweller could be safeguarded. We hope that provisions will be put in place to ensure strong safeguards. The main problem with a database-driven postcode is that, to use it, one needs access to the database. For persons out and about, this means that they must either have copies of the database on handheld computers or smartphones or they must have access to the database using over-the-air connections. It has been reported that the full Eircode database will be in the region of 2 GB in size. Just to put that in perspective, the full NAVTEQ database of maps and postcodes for all of Europe is approximately 2 GB. If our database ends up at 2 GB, the vast majority of satnav devices already in use will not be able to hold the Eircode database and detailed maps of Ireland. These technicalities must be addressed to make the system fit for purpose for the general public. Since Eircode postcodes will be secret, one will not know a neighbour's or stranger's code without being told it. If one happens to be a tourist on a drive in a rural area who comes across a house on fire, one may have no means of directing the emergency services to the location. No possibility exists with Eircode to generate a code on the spot unlike algorithm-based codes, which offer this feature. Eircode postcodes could cost lives, either directly because of errors or indirectly because a better system could improve response times, leading to more lives being saved. We must ensure that what we are doing through this Bill does not lead to such fatalities. We must rejig the system to make it safe. It can be done. A major advantage that Loc8 codes have over Eircode is that the zone and locality codes are logically rather than randomly assigned. This means that delivery drivers or emergency service personnel will be able to learn the zone or locality structures that apply to their areas of responsibility. Another significant plus over Eircode is that the full and locality versions of the Loc8 code include a checker digit that helps to detect common human errors. Loc8 codes are ideal for emergency services in particular. A dwelling-based postcode is only useful for emergencies that occur in and close to dwellings, but many incidents occur away from dwellings, such as cliff, mountaineering and potholing accidents, farm accidents, forestry accidents, missing persons, light aircraft crashes etc. The Loc8 code can help in these situations, as any location on the island of Ireland can be given such a code. Eircode postcodes are particularly useful when reporting issues relating to dwellings, but for many of the day-to-day problems experienced by utility companies and local authorities, Eircode is useless. Using Loc8 codes, it is possible to report a dangerous pothole to a local authority with an accuracy of 6 m, livestock on a road, a faulty street lamp or a gas leak. This shows the benefits of Loc8 codes. As any location can have a Loc8 code, it is especially useful for tourism. Waymarked trails can use it to indicate points along trails or cycleways. Tours could be devised that follow Loc8 codes, which would not be possible using Eircode. This is particularly relevant to a tourism county, for example, County Kerry where I dwell. The Ring of Kerry is in south Kerry and the new tourism route, the Ring of North Kerry, has major potential. There are also the Dingle Peninsula and Ring of Beara tours. Kerry is the most frequently visited county in the country. Using Loc8 codes would be a major plus, as they are ideal for our tour guides etc. Overall, I welcome this Bill, but a bit of tweaking is necessary here and there.Perhaps there is a need to look at some of the other technical uses of this system, such as the ways in which various technologies could be combined and connected into it. I would like to conclude by mentioning an important aspect of this matter that is directly related to the Minister's portfolio. I put it to him that there will not be much need for postcodes if we do not have any post offices. As has already been said in this Chamber, we are well aware of the need to protect and enhance our post offices. I am hopeful and confident that the Minister will be positive in his support of the post office system. The form recently sent out by the office of the Minister for Social Protection, advising customers and social welfare recipients to bypass post offices and instead go to the banks, was a devastating initiative. I ask the Minister to intervene in every way possible with the Tánaiste on this matter. The Cabinet should take up this matter in a serious way. If we do not get the maximum number of people to use post offices for their social welfare business, which is what they generally want, it will be to the detriment of post offices. It is mischievous that they are being directed to go elsewhere. It will cost jobs. I hope it does not lead to the closure of post offices. I ask the Minister to intervene in this regard as a matter of urgency.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	I welcome this Bill as a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Later this year, the Government will introduce a national postcode system, which will assign a unique seven-digit postcode to each postal address in the State. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure the public interest is satisfied in the undertaking of legitimate postcode activities so that the processing of personal data in postcode-enabled databases is in compliance with the Data Protection Acts. The legislation will specify the data protection principles with which the postcode contractor and the re-seller of postcode databases will be obliged to comply. This is to ensure the privacy of the owners and occupiers of properties in respect of which postcodes have been allocated is safeguarded. The main provisions of the Bill before the House include the setting out of the scope of the postcode-related activities to be encompassed by the postcodes legislation. This includes the development and maintenance of a postcode system and the dissemination of postcodes. The legislation also deals with the matching of addresses, the incorporation of address aliases into databases and the licensing of the postcode address database. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may also specify by way of regulations new legitimate postcode activities that may be undertaken. The Minister will be required to consult the Data Protection Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality before making any regulations in this respect. The proposed new section 66A of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Act 2011 will give the Minister the power, by regulations, to set down requirements that a business must satisfy before it can be granted a licence to use a postcode database to provide value-added services. This will enable the Minister to ensure value-added resellers are screened against specific criteria before they can use postcode databases to provide services. This section will also give the Minister the power, by regulations, to require the postcode contractor to include certain specific provisions in the licences it grants to value-added resellers. This will enable the Minister to ensure there is a robust legal framework governing the manner in which value-added resellers use postcode databases, including requirements such as the right to audit, suspend and terminate licences. The postcode contractor will not grant a licence to a value-added reseller or end-user unless it can be demonstrated that it has registered with the appropriate data protection regulator. The proposed new section 66B of the 2011 Act will introduce a specific obligation to publish a privacy notice so that specific information is made readily available to individuals on how postcodes will be used, to whom postcodes may be licensed and the rights of individuals with regard to the correction of data and the making of complaints. The proposed new section 66C will confirm that the postcode contractor, the Minister and the value-added resellers may process personal data for purposes related to or connected with a legitimate postcode activity. The proposed new section 66D will provide for a statutory framework for a complaints procedure in relation to postcodes. This will ensure adequate steps are put in place to safeguard the legitimate interests of the owners and occupiers of properties. The proposed new section 66E will impose a statutory obligation on the postcode contractor to develop a data retention policy to ensure decommissioned postcodes are retained for record-keeping purposes. I commend the Bill to the House.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	I thank Deputies for their contributions and especially for their constructive input into this debate. I appreciate the general support that has been expressed for the Bill, or at least the absence of opposition to the specific provisions contained in it. I accept that Deputies raised some general matters relating to the national postcode project. I will come to some of those in the course of my reply. The number of Deputies who spoke and the range of their contributions is a testament to the importance and relevance of the proposed postcode system. I welcome this opportunity to respond to some of the various comments and observations that were made on the provisions of this Bill and in the broader context. We can all agree that the development of a national postcode is a progressive achievement of the country. I think most colleagues are in agreement on that. Regardless of what people might say about the particular form of the postcode, there appears to be almost universal agreement that it is desirable that we should have a national postcode system. The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2015 marks an important milestone in the implementation of a national postcode system. It will ensure the highest standards of data protection are applied when postcodes are being used. As I outlined in my earlier statement when I was introducing the Bill, the aim of this legislation is to ensure the public interest is satisfied in relation to the undertaking of specific postcode activities which are fundamental to the implementation of the postcode system. The Bill also sets out the steps that the postcode contractor and the value-added resellers are obliged to comply with in order to ensure the safeguarding of the privacy of owners and occupiers of property in respect of which a postcode has been allocated. We are not addressing or debating the tender process lying behind this project, which I mentioned in my opening remarks. It is clear that a proper tendering process was followed with regard to this project. That process has not been impugned. When the EU Commission looked at this matter after it was asked to do so, it made it clear that there was no breach whatsoever of procurement rules. That is clearly on the record. I would also like to clarify, in response to the Deputy who raised this matter, that the Commission has asked the Irish authorities for information on the measures adopted generally by Ireland in relation to the avoidance of any possible misinterpretation of the language that is used in the pre-qualification questionnaire. That is an issue of general application in respect of which the Commission is seeking some further information - it is not specific to this project. Members can be reassured with regard to the robustness and the correctness of the procurement process that was followed. I will do my best to respond to some of the issues that were raised by Deputies during the debate. Deputy Troy asked about the involvement of An Post in the postcode project, particularly during the tender process. I can tell the House that An Post tendered and was involved in the competitive dialogue. Most importantly, An Post is heavily involved in this project and is an integral part of it. An Post was part of the design phase and will be largely responsible for the dissemination of the codes to 2.2 million addresses throughout the State. Eircodes will be fully integrated with An Post's mail-sorting systems. Any integration costs will be part of An Post's overall capital expenditure cost. Those costs are expected to come to approximately €1 million. As I have said, An Post will be heavily involved in the process of disseminating the Eircodes.The An Post chief executive has said that An Post will work closely with Eircode, the company set up by Capita to manage the codes. An Post is very closely involved in the roll-out of this project. Many Deputies raised the non-sequential design of the postcode. It is desirable to have this model because it allows for future expansion of the code, for codes to be assigned to new buildings, homes and premises. It also avoids the potential for postcode discrimination that happens in other countries, where postcode lotteries or ghettoes are created by drawing a line around an area on the basis of the information available through postcodes. That will not be the case under our system. Deputies Troy, Clare Daly, Colreavy, Tom Fleming and perhaps others, raised the support or otherwise for Eircode by organisations, such as the freight industry and emergency services. I repeat there has been widespread support from public and private business for the introduction of Eircode nationally. Nightline, for example, Ireland’s biggest independent logistics firm, fully supports the introduction of Eircode. The objection by one organisation in the emergency services was raised. There is little activity more essential than emergency services. I do not want any impression to go out from this debate that there is anything other than support from them, in particular from the National Ambulance Service, which has welcomed the introduction of Eircode because the codes will facilitate the speedier deployment of these services. This has been stated clearly. Deputy Colreavy asked what business problem is being solved by Eircode. With respect, there is a business demand and issue to be addressed. The national Eircode system will improve the efficiency and accuracy of internal business processes as a result of the improved accuracy and consistency of databases across the public and private sectors. It will facilitate the accurate location of all addresses in the State, including the 35% of addresses that are not unique. It will make it easier for consumers to shop online and assist the development of Irish online commerce and make it quicker and easier for emergency services to locate addresses, particularly in rural areas. It will facilitate the delivery of improved efficiencies with regard to logistics. We have the support of much of industry for that. It will assist better planning and analysis capabilities in the public and private sectors. It will provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved direct marketing capabilities, which will help the postal service. It will enable organisations to improve existing services and-or develop new service offerings. It will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality in the mail sector. These are new advantages that will accrue from the Eircode system. Deputy Pringle made a point about local knowledge associated with the traditional address system. Local knowledge will not disappear. When Eircode comes in this summer the traditional addresses people use will not go away or be deleted from the basic system, memory or use. This will supplement what we have. It will not replace, supplant or wipe out local knowledge. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, it will not mean that the personal contact we value in post offices and throughout the postal system will go. It is not a replacement for what has been there but an addition, and a very welcome and desirable one. The Department has briefed all of the emergency services on this project. The code will be available to all emergency services at whatever stage their systems are ready to exploit it. The National Ambulance Service is already constructing a new computer-aided despatch system to use Eircode and this will be deployed in its new state-of-the-art national call centre later this year. It has welcomed the introduction of Eircode as it will facilitate the speedier deployment of its services. This legislation is to deal with data protection. Deputies Pringle, Boyd Barrett, Clare Daly, and perhaps others, asked about the Data Protection Commissioner. The Data Protection Commissioner has acknowledged the publication of this Bill and views the legislation as a positive underpinning of the implementation and operation of the Eircode system, ensuring that essential data protection safeguards are in place. I want to reassure the House of that. When people raise concerns they are thinking about the use of Eircode with another piece of data. In that case it probably will fall under the Data Protection Commissioner’s definition of personal data but where Eircode is used in conjunction with personal data, such as a name, the Data Protection Acts will apply. The protections will be available in those circumstances. Several Deputies said if we had not used this model there would be no data protection concerns. I question whether there would be no data protection issue if we had used the cluster system. It could be argued that the cluster-based approach is possibly even a greater threat to privacy by making it possible to identify people based on their area or who they live near. Some of the objections from Deputies Clare Daly, Boyd Barrett, and perhaps Deputy Wallace, related more to the involvement of the contractor, Capita. Private Eye was mentioned and we can, and often do, get a laugh from Private Eye but we should be serious about a very serious company and project. Capita employs approximately 2,000 people in this country, across seven business lines. It has contracts with organisations such as the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and has acquired AIB’s international financial services operation. It is a serious company, doing an important job for the State on contract. The notion that we are handing over some public project or something that is an important public policy area to a private company is false. The State is still centre stage. The system is owned by the State but is being operated on its behalf by Capita. It has a ten-year licence but the intellectual property belongs to the State. Eight years of the licence remain and the Minister of the day will have the discretion to extend the licence by five years. Deputies should be clear that ownership rests with the State. I know and understand the concerns people often raise about public services contracted to private bodies. It is a controversial issue and there is no difficulty about debating the proper boundaries for services that ought to be provided directly by the State, a State agency or contracted to private bodies. These issues arise constantly, as one Deputy said, in respect of the health services. There are many successful public services carried out by private companies, for example, construction work done by builders for local authorities. These are successful jobs done for the public good on contract to private providers.The notion that this private involvement is always bad or objectionable is strange.  A number of indigenous companies, including BearingPoint, Autoaddress, Marketing Network and Prior Communications, are involved in this important project. On the model used, given the large proportion of Irish addresses - 35% - which are non-unique, a cluster or area-based code would not achieve anything like the benefits that will be achieved using the model we have chosen. Area-based codes would not make it easier to locate some of these addresses. As Deputy Pringle noted, families sharing the same surname frequently live in the same townland. This is one of the main challenges that will be addressed by the form of postcode we have chosen. I believe we have opted for the correct approach.  Deputies raised the issue of cost. The cost to the Exchequer of the roll-out of the national postcode system over the ten-year cycle of the contract is expected to be €27 million, exclusive of value added tax, with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and Eircode distribution. The cost of the contract will be €16 million over the first two years and a further €1.2 million per annum for the remaining eight years of the project. Since 2010, approximately €1.5 million has been spent on specialist costs arising from the project. The costs of designing Eircode and establishing the Eircode address database account for approximately 9% of total costs. The estimated cost of dissemination to each household will be 6% of the overall total costs. It is expected that 37% of the overall costs over ten years will be attributed to communications and the upgrade of public sector databases.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a question on the costs for business. The Eircode address database will be made available to a variety of business users for purchase. As an earlier speaker noted, small and medium enterprises may avail of the Eircodes free of charge for a limited number of look-ups per day from a dedicated website. The comprehensive pricing structure is available on the Eircode website and the costs for business will vary depending on the type of use and number of users in each licensing organisation.  Deputy Halligan asked about a privacy impact assessment. Although it is not yet a statutory requirement, the Department undertook a privacy impact assessment at the request of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The purpose of the assessment was to ensure that any potential impact on individuals as a result of the introduction of Eircode was recognised and addressed. At a high level, the assessment has concluded that the introduction of Eircodes is unlikely to have any significant adverse effect on the right to privacy. In addition to the licensing conditions with Capita, some strengthening of the data protection safeguards associated with the postcode operations was recommended. The privacy impact statement addresses issues surrounding the need to ensure proper privacy protection and the legislation addresses issues related to data protection.  While this is an important Bill, it is only one aspect of the postcode project, albeit one which required to be addressed in legislation. I thank Deputies again for their contributions and interest in the Bill. I would welcome the support of the House for its provisions. Through the Chair, I respectfully ask Deputies who are members of the Select Sub-committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to table any amendments they may have as quickly as possible in order that I can give them full and fair consideration. I assure the House that I will consider all amendments with an open mind. My overall objective is to progress the Bill to the Statute Book a quickly as possible. I look forward to constructive engagement with Deputies and Members of the other House in due course.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle affording me the opportunity to raise this very important issue. I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, is here to reply. The Minister will be aware that Ibrahim Halawa has been in an Egyptian prison for 666 days, or one year, nine months and 28 days. The initial judicial process has been continually delayed and we now hear that the judge dealing with the case is to retire from his post soon. An eighth court date for his trial has been set for the beginning of August, his case having been adjourned seven times from the beginning of this ordeal. The incarceration of Ibrahim has caused, quite understandably, great upset to his family and friends. As he is a citizen of this country, we must be concerned for his well-being and hope and act for his release. We learned yesterday that Ibrahim has decided to go on hunger strike to highlight his continuing incarceration. This is a most grave development and one which should give urgency to the Government's interaction with the authorities in Egypt to seek a resolution to this deeply troubling situation. Fianna Fáil has been raising this issue, both in the Dáil and in the other House and at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, for almost two years. We are continually informed that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are in regular contact with Ibrahim Halawa, yet, unfortunately, we have not witnessed any significant progress in his case. I am not for one moment suggesting that our officials are not working hard on this case. From what I have heard and from what the Minister has said to me in person and in replies to parliamentary questions, the opposite is the case. Our officials are to be commended on their efforts. However, I am concerned that Government efforts appear to have hit a wall in trying to advance Ibrahim's case. We all understand that Egypt has undergone some tumultuous years. The justice system appears to be struggling to cope with the political changes which have been witnessed by the international community. This seems to be one element in the ongoing delays being put on Ibrahim's case. The fact that he is being tried as part of a mass trial is also unjust, unfair and a gross abuse of his human rights. We have been told that Ibrahim is being accused of acts of violence, yet Amnesty International researchers who were present at the time in question have stated that Ibrahim could not have been involved in such acts. They are very strong in their view on that aspect. Looking at the basic facts of the case, one's heart could not but be moved. Ibrahim is 19 years old. He comes from a loving family who want him home. He is a citizen of Ireland who is entitled to the full rigorous support of our State in being allowed to return home, even if that means on bail. He was arrested due to his political involvement in Egypt and Amnesty International has stated that he is a prisoner of conscience, not of crime.  I believe that it is time for the Government to use all of its influence, both in the European Union and with our American partners, to put pressure on the Egyptian authorities to release Ibrahim Halawa once and for all and reunite him with his family.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	I thank Deputy Smith for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter. The Taoiseach and I met Ibrahim Halawa's father and two of his sisters last week. At that meeting we were informed that Ibrahim had indicated that he was considering embarking on a hunger strike. Noting that Ibrahim's welfare was of paramount concern, I advised against this course of action, saying it would be detrimental to his health and also that it was unlikely to serve any positive purpose as regards his trial. This view was shared by Ibrahim's lawyer who had given him similar advice. I am asking Ibrahim to maintain his health by taking food and I am sure that Deputy Smith will share my view in that regard. Embassy officials attended the most recent hearing on 3 June and visited Mr. Halawa for the forty-first time on Monday, 8 June. During this visit, Ibrahim informed the embassy officials that he had commenced a hunger strike. Embassy officials sought strongly to dissuade him and advised both him and his family that this course of action would be unlikely to serve any positive purpose at all. Together with the Taoiseach, I met with the Halawa family on 4 June to discuss the case. The family raised the question as to why Ibrahim has not been released when other foreign citizens have been. We explained to the family that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is maintaining extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities and with other international partners who have or have had citizens in similar circumstances. It is important to note that different facts and circumstances apply to each case and it is unhelpful to make overly simplistic comparisons between them. In so far as those comparisons are possible, the information that the Department has received from several authoritative sources is very clear. Examining other similar cases, it is clear that irrespective of any political efforts made by foreign governments, including high-level requests, the trial must be completed before any political consideration of a possible release by the Egyptian authorities can take place. In Ibrahim Halawa's case, the trial is ongoing. While we continue to maintain extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities, including at very high levels, the precedent examined to date suggests that it is unrealistic to expect that any release will take place before this initial trial concludes. In the House earlier today, there were incorrect and overly simplistic comparisons made with the case of Peter Greste. I wish to make it clear that Peter Greste's trial had finished, he had been convicted and sentenced, and it was only when this initial judicial process had concluded that the Egyptian authorities were in a position to release him. To suggest that he was released solely because the Australian Prime Minister made a phone call is simply wrong and unhelpful to the bona fide efforts to achieve the release of Ibrahim Halawa. References made in the House earlier to Ireland demanding release are not only unhelpful and potentially detrimental to progress, but show a complete lack of understanding of the measured and responsible way that governments must work to resolve difficult consular issues. That an early release is unlikely is obviously hugely disappointing for Ibrahim Halawa and for his family, as it is for all of us involved in working to seek progress in this case. However, irrespective of any views regarding the fairness or appropriateness of any arrest abroad, the reality is that where an Irish citizen is charged with an offence under the law of a foreign country, it is the foreign law that applies and it is the relevant foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release. While we will continue to bring all of our influence to bear on his behalf through the appropriate channels, the decision to release Ibrahim Halawa will ultimately be a decision that is made solely by the Egyptian authorities.Conversely, we in Ireland would not tolerate a foreign government demanding that a judicial process in the Irish courts be set aside and one of its citizens released. The considered approach and sustained action that I and my officials have taken in this case has been to work in an appropriate way to try and achieve positive progress. Most importantly, we have worked assiduously to avoid any action that could be counterproductive or detrimental to the best interests of this citizen.I would like therefore to thank Deputy Smith for the constructive and responsible way in which he and many members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade have engaged on this case. Others, who adopt a polemical approach, may generate publicity and headlines but they are not serving the best interests of this Irish citizen.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. As I said earlier, I had the opportunity to engage with the Minister person to person, through correspondence and through parliamentary questions as well as at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. Other members of that committee have also expressed their worry for Ibrahim. I would obviously like to see Ibrahim come off the hunger strike right away. We understand the complete stress and trauma the young man has been through for almost two years, and the natural concern and worry of his family back here at home, and of his mother, who has travelled to Egypt. I urge the Minister that there is further concern regarding the reports that the trial judge may be retiring, which could cause further delays. We want to see Ibrahim off hunger strike, released and back at home in the bosom of his family, where he should be at his age in life. None of us can imagine what he is going through in what are very poor conditions, from what we have learned, in a foreign country away from his family. It is understandably difficult for anybody to be in prison, but to be so far away at such a tender age and in difficult circumstances - we can only imagine the agony and hurt he is going through. I am glad the Minister met with the family again over the past week to hear at first hand their obvious concerns. I appeal to him to continue to use every appropriate means to support the case of this young man for the earliest possible release. Whatever political and diplomatic interventions can help obviously need to be pursued. At the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday, a suggestion was put forward that a delegation might go to Egypt to visit the man, if that was considered to be of some help. A small delegation would be glad to travel, if such a visit can be facilitated, to show the support of the Oireachtas for this family during these very trying times.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	I will continue to keep in close contact with the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, with the spokespeople of the main Opposition parties, and with Deputy Smith in particular. There have been some concerns regarding his health and the conditions in the prison. I am very mindful of those concerns. The embassy previously lodged formal requests with the appropriate authorities for a move within the prison and for access to a doctor. The prison authorities sought to organise a trip to the prison hospital for Ibrahim Halawa last week. He declined to go. At the suggestion of the embassy, his lawyers also lodged a medical request with the prison authorities. The embassy has as yet received no response to its request for a move to another part of the prison. The embassy will continue to provide strong consular support for Ibrahim Halawa himself and to monitor his health and conditions in detention. We will continue at every level to advocate on his behalf. Once the court case has been concluded, assuming a sentence in some form may well be imposed, it may be appropriate for the Irish Government to make political representations and to request the Egyptian authorities to confer a presidential pardon. At that time, we will engage. At this stage, it is not possible for such a pardon to be forthcoming because the trial has not been concluded. I am concerned at the delay, as I have said in the House, to my counterpart in Egypt and to a number of other international actors. The position is that there is an application by the defence lawyers which led to the most recent postponement of the case. The judge has agreed to schedule the case for a hearing on 2 August. As Deputy Smith has indicated, since the hearing on 3 June, it has been confirmed that the trial judge is due to retire. It is not clear whether this will have any effect on the timing or scheduling of the current trial. I have continued to highlight Ireland's concern at the length of time that Ibrahim Halawa has now spent in detention without conviction. The appointment of a replacement judge and the timings of the hearings in this case are entirely controlled by the Egyptian judicial system. I will keep the House, members of the foreign affairs committee and the spokespeople on the other side of the House fully informed.

Just before Christmas, there was a short strike by staff at Naas hospital regarding the number of staff in the hospital. I welcomed the Minister's announcement in February that the recruitment ban on nursing staff was to be lifted. In particular, I was glad to hear that Naas hospital was going to get 37 extra nursing staff as a result of that recruitment. As of Monday, one of those new staff members has been recruited in Naas General Hospital. There are 36 who have not yet been appointed.  The National Recruitment Service, NRS, was established in 2009, when there was a recruitment ban in place across the public sector. One wonders at the purpose of the NRS being established at that time as a centralised means of recruiting health service personnel. A certain number of health service personnel would have been recruited by it over the intervening period on an emergency basis. Since the lifting of the embargo, particularly in respect of front-line staff, I have found it difficult to explain how the Minister could make an announcement in February, yet only one staff member has been allocated so far. The NRS told me it allowed the staff to be recruited locally. "Alleluia", I thought. I thought Naas General Hospital itself was going to be recruiting but no, that is not the case. The staff are now being recruited in Tullamore, which was the centre for recruitment in the former midland hospital board area. From what I can gather, the staff in Tullamore, who would not have had much experience of recruitment over the last six or seven years, are now being inundated, as the NRS has pushed this out to the various old boards that used to exist. It is important that we get the staff in Naas hospital as quickly as possible, as is the case for any other staff that have to be allocated. I know there are other issues, and candidates going for interview should have all their appropriate qualifications available to show to recruiters. We are in a crisis situation and it is a different type of crisis from the one in 2009, when we could not recruit staff. Now we can recruit staff.We are going to be actively recruiting staff in the UK who will come back to work here. We should have one organisation that will do it all and take responsibility for it rather than the haphazard approach that seems to be taken at the moment. As I said earlier, I thought Naas hospital would do the recruiting itself but the recruitment has actually been through the old health board HR offices in Tullamore. I hope the Minister can give me some assurance that we will have a speedier approach with regard to recruiting staff. This week there was a spike in the number of people on trolleys at Naas hospital and across the whole hospital sector, and hospital staff are under fierce pressure. If I knew that could be alleviated through additional staff being allocated and put in place as quickly as possible, I would appreciate it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this issue. The national recruitment service, NRS, is actively recruiting hospital staff, in particular for HSE hospitals. Voluntary hospitals tend to do their own recruitment. The NRS was established to deliver high quality, cost effective recruitment through a shared service model in line with Government policy. To date, the NRS provides the full recruitment service for all areas of the HSE, with the exception of non-consultant hospital doctors and home helps. The NRS carries out recruitment for vacancies that have been approved for filling. Some 1,063 posts in the acute hospital sector were filled in 2014, of which two thirds were nursing posts. From January 2015 to date, 529 posts have been filled in the acute hospital sector, of which almost half are nursing posts. There are currently 1,687 posts in the process of being filled in the hospital sector, of which 914 are nursing posts. As the Deputy can see, a lot of recruitment is under way. In local services, 115 nurses have been appointed and 403 nursing appointments are being processed locally. A significant number of panels have been created for disciplines within the acute hospital sector, including national panels for staff nurses and allied health professionals such as therapists and audiologists, and bespoke panels for posts such as clinical nurse specialists, pharmacists and medical scientists. Jobs are being offered directly to people on these panels, thus reducing the time period for appointment to a post. A high profile national campaign to recruit nurses and midwives is in operation. This includes national and local interviewing of general nurses, registered children's nurses and midwives. The HSE has also established an international recruitment steering group to focus on attracting and recruiting Irish trained nurses back home to practice and build their careers. In terms of consultant recruitment, 38 hospital consultant posts were filled in 2014 in HSE hospitals and 36 have been filled this year, so, in the first half of this year, we have recruited almost as many as in all of last year. Ongoing recruitment of 193 consultant posts is in progress and this is carried out in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. Further appointments have been made in the voluntary hospitals and non-acute settings. There are some specialties in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. Shortages in specialties such as emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry are a worldwide phenomenon and not specific to the Irish health service. There are also some hospitals to which it has been historically difficult to attract applicants, in particular small hospitals which are not recognised for training and continuous development purposes. The establishment of hospital groups will help to address this issue, as it will allow staff to be appointed to the group rather than one hospital. Finally, where recruitment difficulties apply, individual strategies are developed for these in conjunction with the line managers. Where front-line staffing shortages exist, the HSE makes alternative arrangements to ensure continued service provision, including recourse to agency cover. However, it is preferable that sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses are recruited to permanent posts to support continuity of care. In regard to Naas specifically, I am told the hospital has 37 active nursing posts it is trying to recruit for at the moment. This comprises four promotional posts, which are at campaign stage, two posts that are at job offer stage and one post at contract stage. Thirty staff nurse posts are being processed locally, which means the posts are being interviewed locally, offered locally and the clearances and the contacts are being dealt with locally. The NRS is not processing these posts. Local HR at Naas General Hospital has advised that it is actively appointing these posts in partnership with the director of nursing. In most cases, it is waiting for the return of documentation from candidates and this documentation is necessary to appoint candidates. It should also be recognised that some candidates may be offered posts elsewhere and might take those posts, which means starting the whole process again. Local HR is actively following up with candidates in this regard in order to ensure the posts are filled as soon as possible. It is news to me that it is being done through Tullamore. As the Deputy knows, Tullamore was the centre of the old Midland Health Board. To the best of my recollection, Naas was in the Eastern Health Board and was part of the South Western Area Health Board, so I cannot imagine why it would be done through Tullamore. I will certainly have that checked out.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	I can verify, from both Naas hospital and the NRS, that it is being done. I understand the delays can sometimes be caused by the need to get Garda clearance and there might not be enough staff in the NRS to be able to recruit the correct numbers as quickly as possible. I might make a suggestion to the Minister, given he spoke about allocating staff to groups. Why not hire the staff through the HR department within a group, as this might be more beneficial and would be much more targeted, rather than having an over-arching body which is recruiting from all parts of the country and outside the country? The group itself could identify candidates. There is a CEO and a management structure in each group, and I am sure there is a HR department. Why should the HR departments within each group not recruit locally? Another difficulty is that the voluntary hospitals are allowed to recruit. It is one HSE and all staff are paid through the one body. Why should there be preferential treatment for voluntary hospitals as against the non-voluntary hospitals such as Naas hospital? If we are working in a group system, let us have the recruitment on a group basis and not give priority to one hospital over the other. I hope any staff who are going forward for interview would present as much of the documentation as possible so there is not this delay later on. I know we are in a situation where staff do not know if they will get permanent posts in the new recruitment process. I hope that, as this works its way through, it will be speeded up. We are at a sort of crisis point at the moment, as I see on a daily basis with people on trolleys at Naas Hospital and at other hospitals around the country. At the same time, there is potential for us to recruit the staff. I welcome that the Minister has given sanction for these staff and I appreciate his comments. However, I ask that the groups be able to hire separately from the NRS.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	I will make three points. The first is that we are in a very different situation this year than we were for the last three or four years. The last three or four years were all about not recruiting and not filling vacancies and now, all of a sudden, the NRS has been told to recruit lots of people very quickly. It is a struggle to turn around from being an organisation that was about staff retrenchment to being one that is now about recruitment. However, we have 1,000 more people working in our health service today than we had this time last year, so it is happening, albeit not quickly enough. Second, it is my intention to allow the groups to recruit in the medium term. That is difficult at present, for one very obvious reason, namely, the groups do not exist as legal entities; they are administrative bodies and do not exist in law and, therefore, cannot be employers. That is in stark contrast to the voluntary hospitals, which do exist in law and can be employers. If one works in a voluntary hospital like St. Vincent's or the Mater, one is not an employee of the HSE but an employee of St. Vincent's or the Mater, whereas an employee at Naas is an employee of the HSE. That is a complication that, as the Deputy will have noticed, is making the newspapers in various different ways in the last while. Third, one downside of going back to allowing the groups to recruit is that we then go back to one of the problems that caused the NRS to be set up in the first place. Before the NRS was set up, people would go around doing interviews in four or five different health boards, and 6,000 to 7,000 days were lost every year with people doing one interview in the Southern Health Board, then one in the Midland Health Board and then one in the Western Health Board. When recruitment was centralised, the number of days lost to people doing interviews was reduced by 70%. One of the downsides of bringing that back and allowing local and group recruitment is that many more people will be looking for time off either to do interviews or to be on interview panels. We would have to bear that in mind given the impact it would have on patient care.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I want to raise the issue of the cutbacks to accident and emergency services at Portlaoise which were announced recently, although some might say that no final decisions have been made.There was a report in The Irish Times last September which stated that Department of Health submissions to the Government's comprehensive spending review suggested closing 24-hour services at five hospital accident and emergency departments, including Portlaoise hospital. For several months, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have planned for what was announced last week. It has now been said that no final decision has been made and that charade will continue for some time to come.  Since that announcement was made there have been further difficulties in Portlaoise hospital as a result of a lack of funding and resources provided by the Minister and the HSE. This time last year there were 41 people waiting over one year for an outpatient appointment. Today, the number has increased by 427 to 468 people, a tenfold increase, or a 1,000%, increase in the number of people.  We know there have been problems in the maternity unit. I will give the Minister credit for addressing them properly. The changes have resulted in an additional 15 or 16 staff being employed and the memorandum of understanding with the Coombe hospital, which is now managing the facility. We are happy to have national management and standards in the maternity unit in Portlaoise hospital. What is now needed is the same dedicated approach to the accident and emergency unit to ensure that additional staff can do their work.  I would be happy for St. James's Hospital, which is in the group, to take over the management and control of the accident and emergency department in Portlaoise hospital to ensure national standards apply and services are delivered there.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue and the fact three relevant Ministers are present. The HSE statement to local media on 3 June set the issue off, but there was some information about it beforehand. The relevant part of the statement referred to a complex planning process that, in the medium to longer term, will result in a reduction in emergency department opening hours overnight. I do not need to make the case for the hospital in terms of the number of patients, motorways, the two large prisons in the area and that we need to have accident and emergency services available so that people can be brought in within the golden hour. It is not a case of parochialism and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, knows that. This is a case of cold logic in terms of life and death. The HIQA report highlighted shortcomings in the hospital in regard to a number of services, in particular maternity services. I compliment the Minister for the work that has been done regarding maternity services. It was long overdue. The Minister took the bull by the horns, did what needed to be done and recruited 16 extra front-line staff, which I welcome.  Dr. Susan O'Reilly, CEO of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, said on 26 February, "I intend to have 24 hours ED services continue in Portlaoise. You have surgical services that can provide general surgery. They need to be strengthened. I am confident we can continue to provide safe services." That is very clear. On 14 May the Minister said that the risk to patients in Portlaoise emergency department is very low as there are consultant staff and everyone is under the governance of a named consultant.  I want the Minister to address Government policy regarding regional hospitals like Portlaoise hospital where there is a long distance between accident and emergency units and they are strategically located on a road network, as well as taking the prison situation into account. 
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I thank the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, for being present to take this very important issue. Recent media reports and commentary regarding Portlaoise hospital have been a cause of great concern for my constituents in Kildare South. Many have used the maternity services in Portlaoise hospital and many residents in Athy, Monasterevin and Newbridge have used the hospital as much as Naas. Portlaoise hospital also has a paediatric emergency department which Naas does not, as the Minister will be aware, and the next nearest paediatric emergency department is Tallaght hospital, which is a long way to drive from south Kildare if one has a sick child. I am mindful of the HIQA report and the absolute necessity to ensure the safe delivery of services. I acknowledge the moves already made in Portlaoise hospital, including the Coombe hospital's management of maternity services, which is to be welcomed. Recent commentary about examining future complex surgery and the emergency department has caused major concern. Since the media report and commentary, Naas Hospital has seen a significant increase in the pressure on its emergency department. That, coupled with the fact that there were very few people on trolleys in Portlaoise hospital in the past week, means one can see the inextricable links between the two hospitals, even when there was media commentary about the future of Portlaoise hospital. I do not want to see the loss of the 24/7 emergency department in Portlaoise hospital in the future, but in any review that looks to maximise safety and the provision of services following the HIQA report, I want the safety of patients in Naas General Hospital and the residents of south Kildare's safety to be considered equally with that of Portlaoise hospital. There needs to be an acceptance that any decisions in Portlaoise hospital have a direct impact on the services in Naas General Hospital and Kildare. I want a commitment from the Minister in the House that there will be no change to the services in Portlaoise hospital without due consideration of the impact on Naas General Hospital and south Kildare. We need to increase the capacity of Naas General Hospital as it is. The endoscopy unit and day ward plan for Naas General Hospital need to be constructed in 2015, not started in 2016 as originally planned. The building needs to commence, even if Portlaoise hospital maintains its currents services due to the size and scale of our county.

The Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of Portlaoise hospital as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which also includes St James's, Tallaght, Tullamore, Naas and the Coombe hospitals. Any change to services at Portlaoise hospital will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise hospital in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. Decisions will be made on the basis of maximising patient safety and patient outcomes, not financial considerations, and that is the only guarantee I can give.  In recent months, substantial investment and enhancement measures have been put in place to ensure a safer level of service at the hospital. Maternity services will be upgraded following a memo of understanding between the HSE and the Coombe hospital to provide a managed clinical maternity network within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. Furthermore, improvements in Portlaoise hospital generally include a number of additional consultants posts in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics, obstetrics and medicine, and an additional 16 midwifery posts. It is also intended to provide a new acute medical admissions unit and to expand day surgery, and a new paediatric emergency triage unit is being developed.  The group CEO has set out clearly what is being proposed for Portlaoise hospital and has made it clear that maternity, acute medical and paediatric services will continue, as will 24/7 anaesthetics, and that elective day surgery is likely to be expanded. Patient safety and best clinical outcomes for patients must come first and, as Deputies are aware, last week the HSE advised that complex surgery, such as bowel surgery, in Portlaoise hospital will be transferred to St. James's Hospital or Tullamore hospital as the volumes are too low to maintain the requisite expertise of clinical staff.  Indeed, the HIQA report specifically criticises the HSE for recruiting additional consultant surgeons at Portlaoise hospital when patient numbers were not sufficient to allow them to maintain their skills. Anyone who is perpetrating the nonsense that this is about resources needs to read and understand that report. The HSE was criticised for hiring more consultants and overstaffing a service, thereby making it unsafe because the patient load was not adequate. Currently, all categories of surgical patients can arrive at the emergency department at Portlaoise hospital. The hospital group, in collaboration with Portlaoise hospital and other hospitals in the group, need to plan for how some of these patients can be transferred and cared for in the most appropriate high volume surgical services within the group.  Deputy Stanley referred to the golden hour. It is important to understand to what that applies and means. It is particularly relevant for something like an ST elevation MI, STEMI, where ideally one needs to be in a cath lab within 90 minutes of diagnosis. Going to Portlaoise hospital now is not a good idea if one has a STEMI because it does not have a 24/7 cath lab. People with STEMIs are not taken to Portlaoise hospital because they will not be treated within the golden hour. The same applies to major trauma orthopaedics. Such patients are not and should not be taken to Portlaoise hospital, because they need to be taken to a major trauma centre. That is why they are taken to Tullamore hospital.  The important point to understand here is that work is being done to strengthen services in Portlaoise hospital from a patient safety and quality perspective and to ensure that services currently provided by the hospital that are not viable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.This is also in keeping with the recommendations of the report by HIQA into services at the hospital and indeed other hospitals. The emergency department at Portlaoise hospital has between 30,000 and 40,000 attendances per year. Its patient experience times are the best in the country. There is no question, therefore, of it being closed. The only question that has emerged, as raised by the chief executive officer, is whether 24-hour services are sustainable. No decision in this regard has been made or can yet be made. In the case of Navan, for example, surgical services are no longer provided but the hospital continues a 24-hour emergency department for medical patients and those with minor injuries. I strongly agree that any proposal to end 24-hour services at Portlaoise could not be advanced without a clear and credible plan to provide additional capacity at Tullamore, Naas and Tallaght hospitals, which are already overstretched. At the same time, I hope Deputies understand that a hospital that does not and cannot do complex surgery is not the best place to take a patient who needs complex surgery in an emergency, for the obvious reason that it cannot be done there.

He has given a commitment to meet with public representatives from County Laois some day next week, along with his colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan. He stated that changes would happen but that they would be done on a planned basis. He also stated that the CAT scan does not operate on a 24-hour basis.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	Okay. Will he clarify for how many hours the CT scanner is open in the hospital? The real concern is about the downgrade. We already understand the ambulance protocols that are in place. If there is a serious accident on a motorway, even within a mile of Portlaoise hospital, those with broken limbs will be sent to Tullamore, as it deals with orthopaedic issues. If one has a stroke in County Laois, one goes to Naas. Those protocols are already in place and people are satisfied with them. To say that the facility will be for medical patients with minor injuries, as is happening at Navan, is essentially a downgrade. If the service is scaled back from 24-hour to 12-hour, people will stop going to the hospital in the evening because they might not be seen by eight o’clock. The regional manager has suggested that people who are not in the immediate vicinity of Portlaoise should be going somewhere else to start with. There is a plan in place, whether it is on the Minister’s desk or not - and he should know about it - to reduce the numbers attending Portlaoise hospital so that the HSE can ultimately say the service is not sustainable in the interests of patient safety. Once one starts reducing the hours from 24, one is on the slippery slope.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome his acceptance that Naas, Tullamore and Tallaght are already overstretched. The concern is that the acute medical unit may be used as a replacement for the emergency department. Being a medical person, the Minister will understand that these are two very different facilities. I accept his point about the golden hour and stabilised patients. However, it is necessary to have an accident and emergency unit in the hospital because of the case I outlined earlier. To have the accident and emergency unit staffed properly with proper consultancy cover is important. I am concerned about the grouping of emergency services among some of the Dublin hospitals. It has been done already with maternity services in Portlaoise, which people accepted. This is not blind parochialism. The case was made for this and the results so far have been good. That, along with the extra staff recruited to the maternity service, is a positive step. The hospital needs new accommodation for its maternity unit. I accept that no final decision has been made. However, I do not want the Government dragging this process beyond the general election. We want this sorted. The situation with Abbeyleix hospital has been allowed to drag on for three years since the public consultation process ended. This cannot be allowed to happen with this hospital, as it is an important issue. I hope it is resolved quickly.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	I thank the Minister for his detailed response. I welcome his statement on maximising resources and improving outcomes and the fact that it is not about financial considerations. We are all on the same page when it comes to patient safety and quality. It is about finding the best way to achieve that for the residents of Counties Laois and Kildare. I also welcome his acknowledgement of the pressure that management, staff and patients in Naas hospital are experiencing. In acknowledging that, we then have to figure out how best we can alleviate it both in the short and long term. Kildare has a population of 210,000 people but it has a disproportionate number of nursing homes, particularly in the north of the county, because there are fewer of them in Dublin. That means some of the patients who present at Naas are older and sicker compared to those presenting at other hospitals, which brings its own pressures. The emergency department in Naas has eight cubicles and two resource rooms. This is not enough for the size of the population in Kildare. We are lucky to have an amazing staff in Naas hospital who work under intense pressure. We need to relieve the pressure and ensure it is not intensified by any future actions. Construction of the endoscopic unit needs to be commenced this year. As part of that build, there is the potential to build several extra wards. Will this be considered by the HSE and the Department as a means of addressing the pressure that Naas hospital is under? I also welcome the Minister's statement that no decision would be made without due consideration for Naas.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-06-11 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	I very much agree that the maternity ward in Portlaoise hospital needs a capital investment. This will be discussed with the master of the Coombe and others in the next while. The unit in Portlaoise is probably about 30 to 50 years old. However, Deputies should bear in mind that there are other hospitals, both paediatric and maternity, that are 200 years to 300 years old. Unfortunately, we need to prioritise which need investment first. The potential impact of any changes on Naas, Tullamore and Tallaght is fully understood. We have seen reconfiguration without adequate provision in other regions in the past. In the north east enormous pressure was put on Drogheda, while in the mid-west it was Limerick that bore the brunt. That was done by the last Government and I do not intend to repeat it. It was right to do the reconfiguring, but the central hospitals should have been properly resourced too. What I cannot do is give absolute commitments. No honest politician can and nobody should trust a politician who goes around making absolute commitments about the future because we cannot predict it. What if it turns out that we cannot hire senior staff to work an emergency department at night? It will not be possible in ten or 15 years to be staffing emergency departments at night with locum doctors with poor English and no emergency training. That might have been fine ten years ago, and we might even get away with it now. However, that is not the kind of health service we want in ten years’ time. We have to know we can staff it with senior staff. We also have to ensure we can indemnify it. What if the State Claims Agency were to remove indemnification? Will we then ask patients to sign a waiver before they go in at night to say they will not sue if anything goes wrong? Anyone making these kind of cast-iron promises for the future is just not an honest person. I was disappointed to hear Deputy Sean Fleming make those kind of undertakings. Will he tell the people of Laois if he has discussed this with his party leader, Deputy Martin, and whether Fianna Fáil will stand over that commitment as a party? It should be borne in mind that Deputy Martin, one of the most senior politicians in Cork and a Minister in the last Government, was in power when the number of 24-7 emergency departments in County Cork was reduced from five to two. That was done in his county and he stood over it. He was right to do so. Can Deputy Fleming be sincere about his commitments when his party leader did the exact opposite in his own county?
