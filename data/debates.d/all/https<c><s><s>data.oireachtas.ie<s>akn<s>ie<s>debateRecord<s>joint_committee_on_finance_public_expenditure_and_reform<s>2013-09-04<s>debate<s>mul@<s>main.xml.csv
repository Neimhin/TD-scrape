#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	0	We now move on to No. 5 on today's agenda, an overview of the financial sector. I welcome Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive of Bank of Ireland. He is accompanied by Mr. Stephen Mason, director, mortgage arrears resolution strategy and Republic of Ireland collections; Mr. Gerry Prizeman, head of small business and agriculture division; and Mr. Pat Farrell, head of group communications and government relations division. The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Boucher will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off. There was much interference at yesterday's meeting. I do not know if it was coming from the members' side, the delegates' side or the Visitors Gallery, but it was creating considerable distortion. If phones are switched on, I will ask either the member or the person in the Visitors Gallery to leave the proceedings because they are interfering with them. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. The critical part of these meetings with the banks in coming days is drilling down into the 20% figure that was set to be reached by 30 June. The committee is trying to establish what range of resolution processes is being offered and what sustainable long-term solutions are being put in place. It is an opportunity for it to ascertain if there is consistency in approaches across the banks or if there are similarities. It also allows us to understand what difficulties might arise in reaching that figure, particularly as it grows towards year end when it has to be 50%. As part of his opening statement, I ask Mr. Boucher to give us strong details in that regard. While there are other aspects of the banking situation that need to be reviewed in terms of how mortgage lending might be developing and how new finances in the SME sector are structured, the elephant in the room is how the banks are meeting the 20% figure. We want to deal with that issue in detail. As part of his opening statement, I ask Mr. Boucher to address it specifically and in detail. I again welcome Mr. Boucher, Mr. Prizeman, Mr. Mason and Mr. Farrell. I call on Mr. Boucher to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	1	I thank the Chairman. We have provided a presentation for the committee. I hope all members have received it as I would like to spend a couple of minutes going through it. I pick up on the request of the Chairman to try to drill down to numbers. Therefore, at certain stages I will obviously slow down and talk about them in more detail. The purpose of our presentation is in compliance with the committee's invitation which from a Bank of Ireland perspective is to highlight the progress the bank has made in the past four years, particularly since the last meeting we had with the committee in November 2012; to highlight the work we are doing to support our Irish and SME customers; to highlight how we are working with existing and new customers in Ireland to grow our business; and to provide an overview of the strong progress the bank is making towards sustainable profitability within a robust balance sheet. It is also obviously important from our perspective to review the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, the cash returns the taxpayer has received from the bank and the fact that the taxpayer is in profit in its investment in the bank. Bank of Ireland's overall objective is to have a strong sustainable bank supporting its customers, growing its core franchises and contributing to and benefiting from economic recovery.In terms of the presentation, I think it would be appropriate to spend some time setting out our strategic objectives. Despite the domestic and international challenges of the past four years, Bank of Ireland has had a clear focus on the future, in particular protecting and maintaining our core franchises, of which the most important strategically is our Irish business. For more than three years we have had in place an Irish Government-sponsored EU restructuring viability plan. This plan required us to set out the reasons the group required restructuring and State aid, and our plans to complete that restructuring and ensure we did not require State aid in the future. The plan is monitored by an independent trustee on behalf of the Commission. Since we last met the committee, there have been some amendments to the plan which allow us retain our New Ireland business and which require us to further divest certain of our businesses in Great Britain. In Ireland, we are number one or two in all of our businesses. In the UK, we are the chosen financial services partner for the UK Post Office, with contracts extending beyond 2023. We also have a highly profitable acquisition finance business in the United States, continental Europe and Great Britain. We have made significant progress in deleveraging our international businesses, such that total customer loans have reduced from €145 billion to approximately €90 billion, while protecting our capital. At the same time, we have been investing heavily in our businesses, particularly in Ireland, and have reduced our costs by 23%. Our capital position is robust. During the past four years, we have generated equity capital of approximately €9.7 billion, of which approximately 85% has come from the private sector. Taxpayers have invested €4.8 billion in Bank of Ireland. The bank has reimbursed cash of €3.9 billion to the taxpayer. Taxpayers currently hold €1.8 billion in preference shares in the Bank of Ireland and a 15% equity shareholding in the bank. Bank of Ireland currently has an equity market capitalisation of €6.7 billion, excluding the preference shares. Our capital ratios are robust and, at the end of June, our most recent reporting period, stood at 14.2%, which is significantly above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. Since we last met the committee we have continued to access the capital and subordinated debt markets through the issuance of €250 million of tier two capital in November 2012 and facilitating the State in the re-financing of the contingent capital instrument of €1 billion, with a profit to the State. The State has invested €1.8 billion in preference shares in the Bank of Ireland. We are in discussions with the State and a range of other parties in relation to the options regarding these preference shares. We have transformed our funding and have achieved the PCAR required loan-to-deposit ratio of 120%, and customer deposits and wholesale funding greater than one year equate to our customer loans. We have led the way in accessing senior debt and bond markets, with a range of issues over the past seven months. The quantum of deposits and other liabilities covered by the exceptional Irish Government guarantees has reduced from €136 billion at the end of September 2008 to approximately €8 billion at the end of June. There will be further reductions in those liabilities as we go forward. Our monetary authority financing, including and excluding NAMA bonds, which are €4 billion, is approximately €5 billion, which means it is approaching normal levels. We have made strong progress in moving towards profit on a sustainable basis while remaining focused on the protection and strengthening of our businesses. Costs are down 23%. Direct staff costs were down 10% in the first half of 2013 as compared with the first half of 2012 and 8% since the second half of 2012. We have a significant deficit in our pension schemes and are currently in discussions with staff representatives under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission on this issue. Our impairment charges are elevated but are reducing. We expect them to reduce further. On our medium-term financial targets, which were set at the time of the bank's recapitalisation in 2011, I can confirm that we are on track to achieve all of these financial targets. Slide 5 illustrates the transformation in respect of funding, in particular since Ireland entered the troika support programme in December 2010. Slide 6 provides further detail on our capital, which is obviously important from our perspective and for the taxpayers' investment. It shows our capital on a Basel II basis and Basel III transitional basis and if Basel III were to happen as of end June. This demonstrates that we have robust capital ratios on a Basel II and Basel III basis. Slide 7 also sets out the capital and funding transactions completed by the bank since it last met the committee and, again, shows that right across the capital structures and debt market structures we are accessing those markets with good demand for Bank of Ireland debt. Slide 8 illustrates the position in respect of each of our principal trading divisions, including retail Ireland, our corporate and treasury business, which also has significant businesses in Ireland, retail UK division, which is the post office and, as required by the Bank of England, our Northern Ireland businesses and of our Bank of Ireland life business, which is primarily the New Ireland business which we were allowed to retain following amendment to our EU restructuring and viability programme. What is demonstrated in this slide is what each of the divisions is moving towards in operating profit and is making strong progress in that regard, contributing to the group's overall performance. Slide 9 shows that our impairment charges continue to reduce. This reflects the diversification of our portfolios, the gradual, slow improvement in economic conditions in the main markets in which we operate, a number of steps taken by the bank, and in particular the gradual reduction and relatively swift reduction since 2012 in the number of customers moving into default categories and the stabilisation of collateral values which underpin our loans. Slide 10 provides further detail on individual portfolios, with particular relevance to Irish retail mortgages, Irish SME advances, defaulted loans, the percentage defaulted loans as a proportion of advances, our impairment provisions and the coverage of our provisions against defaulted loans. Members will note that notwithstanding the gradual improvement in economic conditions, we have kept our provision coverage levels at a relatively high level. Slide 11 sets out the change in our defaulted volumes in owner-occupier mortgages. Owner-occupier mortgages in our Republic of Ireland businesses stand at €20.6 billion, 93% of which are on a capital and interest repayment basis through amortisation. Some 55% of our owner-occupier mortgages are ECB tracker. From our perception of the market environment, housing prices have continued to stabilise and employment levels have increased modestly in recent quarters. Our provisioning assumptions, which were noted on the previous slide, are based on the assumption that peak to trough fall in house prices in Ireland is 55% plus other charges of approximately 10% for sale discounts, etc. In terms of our overall portfolio, nine out of ten of our accounts are fully performing. Bank of Ireland arrears levels, based on the latest Central Bank of Ireland statistics as of end June 2013, are 53% of the remainder of the industry. Our arrears reflect economic and affordability issues. We continue to monitor our portfolios and do not believe that negative equity is a driver of default. It is primarily a case of customer income issues. Growth in defaulted loans continues to reduce. I am happy to advise the committee that as of end June, early arrears, namely, customers who have fallen into early arrears of fewer than 90 days in the months of June, July and August, have continued to reduce. Further detail is provided on the slide, which I will not spend too much time on now. However, I am happy to elaborate further later with the support of my colleagues. We have tried to assist the committee by giving a pictorial illustration of what our book looks like by the numbers. As I mentioned, 89% of customers, or 143,000 accounts, are fully performing, and these customers are meeting all their repayments in accordance with their contractual arrangements or where we have granted a forbearance to the customers. Some 2% of customers are in early arrears, and as I mentioned earlier to the committee, the net early arrears figure in June, July and August for owner-occupiers in Bank of Ireland has fallen. Late arrears, which we define as customers who are more than 90 days in arrears, stand at 3%. Of our book, 4% is in a forbearance or overpayment arrangement. I will display a slide on our forbearance arrangement in a moment but I will first explain our definition of an overpayment. That is where the customer has agreed with us an informal arrangement. The customer would not have completed a standard financial statement, SFS, but has indicated that he or she is €700 or €800 in arrears and because the person is getting overtime, for example, there is a wish to make an overpayment of €200 per month, for instance, on top of existing arrangements for a period to catch up. We are comfortable doing that and as such that is our definition of overpayment. The customer would be meeting the full contractual repayments and catching up outside a formal forbearance structure. There is 2% of the owner-occupier book in what we call a resolution, which is either a legal process or consensual arrangement with the customer involving disposal of the property. The legal process from our perspective or what we define as a legal process is not a case of us having written to the customer threatening action but where at least a solicitor's letter has issued to the customer. We do not anticipate that all customers in a process where legal matters have commenced will end up in a repossession scenario. We have found that when the first solicitor's letter arrives, engagement begins with customers. With regard to the buy-to-let book, 57% is on a capital and interest payment basis. The figure was 52% at the end of December, and given the nature of the products we provided, particularly four to five years ago, such as five years of interest-only payments, we anticipate that the contractual arrangements for customers to move to full amortisation of loans will be done within the next 18 months. There has been a reduction in the total portfolio through customer repayments and 81%, or €5.3 billion, of the buy-to-let portfolio is on ECB tracker mortgages. The environment and provisioning assumptions are the same as for the owner-occupier businesses. I have mentioned in the past to the market that of the portfolio, approximately €2.5 billion or €2.6 billion is made up of cases where a single customer might have multiple properties. The arrears performance of that portfolio is significantly worse than the overall portfolio. We find that where a customer has one buy-to-let property, the arrears performance is not exactly the same but is broadly similar to the arrears performance that we see in the owner-occupier book. It is not a direct correlation but I hope it gives further colour to the discussion. Approximately €2.6 billion of the book is made up of single customers with multiple properties and the default and arrears experience for those is materially worse than the rest of the portfolio. As I mentioned, the average figure is €5.6 billion. Notwithstanding what I have just said, our arrears levels are 72% against the rest of the industry. I drew the committee's attention to the fact that 57% of customers are in amortisation or moving towards amortisation, and part of that increase in arrears comes from a position where customers were not meeting contracted amortisation. We have sought engagement with those customers to move them towards amortisation where possible. We have tried to assist the committee by giving a pictorial representation of our performing book and the arrears book. Early arrears in the buy-to-let sector, notwithstanding the fact that customers are moving towards amortisation, have stabilised in the past three months.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	2	It has shown reduction in the past three months.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	3	Thank you. Late arrears constitute a significantly higher proportion than the equivalent section of the owner-occupier book, but nevertheless it is 8%. Forbearance and overpayment constitutes 4% of the book, and legal and resolution processes constitute 7% of the book. In the case of buy-to-let mortgages, we have approximately 1,100 to 1,200 rent receivers appointed. In our accounts at the end of June, we gave approximately 13 or 14 pages of quite densely packed but comprehensive analysis of our mortgage books, particularly focusing on forbearance treatments. To assist the committee, we have tried to bring that information into one concise page, and the rest of the information is also available from accounts. I can give it to the committee if it would be of benefit later. We can provide some further detail of the assessments we have done since June, including SFS assessments since July and the proportion that has move into restructuring, etc. Would that be of assistance?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	5	We met the target and I can give some colour to the process. With regard to the target for PDH customers, there were 11,774 accounts in default at the end of March.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	8	We reported to the Central Bank at the end of June that 26% of those, or 3,103, were in the legal resolution process, with 27%, or 3,164, of those either in restructuring or cured.

We were asked to report the position at the end of June, with 3,103 in the legal or resolution process as defined by Mr. Boucher. There were 3,164 which either had restructuring offered, were in restructuring or had been cured. The total is 53%, as reported at the end of June. Mr. Boucher asked me to answer a question, and we would have assessed 1,487 cases in July via SFS, making restructuring offers to 1,209 of the customers. In 149 cases, the mortgage was repayable by the customer so we did not make a restructuring offer. That applied to approximately 10% of applicants. In 139 cases assessed we believed the mortgage to be unsustainable. Across the seven months we assessed 10,689 cases and made restructuring offers to 8,211. We considered 1,381 to be affordable and 1,097 to be unsustainable in the same period.

Perhaps you might discuss that with your colleagues sitting beside you. We will proceed as agreed. What you have said is correct, but we have discussed how we are going to deal with this issue. I call Deputy Michael McGrath.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	14	My point is that for the purposes of making the analysis as meaningful as possible, the bank must report to the Central Bank in respect of quarter two, the period to the end of June. Perhaps we might have details of that report, the number of offers made in quarter two and a breakdown of these offers. That is essentially what we are seeking.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	15	They were in the first part of the breakdown I gave. What we were being asked to do was - it was a stock figure - to give what account defaults we had at the end March and state where they were at the end of June. They were the figures I gave the committee at the start.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	16	Chairman, as ours is a public company, I bore in mind the requests of the committee today. I asked my colleagues to produce this information last night and, as a public company, we are required to verify any information. There was a verification process. We are trying to give information which goes beyond the information provided in our accounts at the end of June. If I could give some further colour, of the 1,487, obviously what is of particular interest to the committee is the arrears customers. For the month of July, 995 customers had their SFS assessment where these were arrears accounts and 770 of them were offered forbearance. The total stock of forbearance offers outstanding at the end of June was 963. What I am trying to demonstrate in what we have tried to assist with here is that we must be careful with one month's figures. What we have tried to do is to give the July figure and the figure for the year to date. The pattern is consistent. When the customer is engaged with us, in over 80% of cases we can offer a restructure arrangement. That is both for customers who are not in arrears and those who are in arrears.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	17	One of the difficulties we encountered yesterday afternoon was that when we broke down the figures with Allied Irish Banks, there was a point of contention as to what was and was not a resolution. Part of that is that while a communication to a customer to try to bring him or her into a resolution process or even to try to get a financial statement from him or her is helpful, the outcome is not a resolution as it is still in process. That is a legacy issue from yesterday afternoon. What we are trying to establish with Bank of Ireland is not those not being engaged with by the bank and those not in communication but those who are actually at the point of a resolution where a sustainable solution has now been agreed such that there is a future for them, with some level of hope that if they work through this process, they will be free of a burden of debt. That is the figure we are trying to get from Mr. Boucher.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	18	Absolutely. I reaffirm, as I am required to do as it is a public company, that these are restructures. The figures we have provided do not relate to where we have moved to a legal process. Again, as my colleague mentioned, we have given our definition of a legal process. Our definition of a legal process commencing is not the bank threatening or making telephone calls. It is a different definition.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	19	Mr. Boucher is not defining that as resolution either.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	20	No. In the figures we have provided the hard figures for arrears customers who provided us with SFSs that we assessed during the month of July - they were arrears customers who were owner-occupiers. They are 995 assessments completed and 770 offers made to customers of a restructure, which in our terms is a sustainable restructure. That is the figure. I have also tried to-----
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	21	We are dealing with three sets of figures. As the figures have not been presented on paper to committee members, it is very difficult to follow this. The requirement under the Central Bank and the Government's proposal was in respect of a target for accounts in arrears over 90 days - Mr. Boucher has given that figure as 11,774 - whereby 20% of them were to have long-term sustainable offers made to them. That is the breakdown we need. Mr. Boucher is talking about the position in July, but the first point of consideration for this committee is the period April, May and June, the quarter in which, under the Central Bank's rules, the bank was obliged to have made offers to 20%. We must concentrate on these figures first and then get clarity on the breakdown.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	22	I will ask Mr. Mason to reaffirm the figures we provided.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	23	We are trying to give more information to be helpful. That was what July and assessments figures were about. To answer the specific question raised by the Deputy, the target was 20% and what we returned was a figure of 53%. I have broken these down into cases that are in the legal or resolution process and cases where we have made restructures or cured the accounts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	24	Will Mr. Mason give those figures again?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	25	The amount of accounts in default at the end of March was 11,774. What we had to report on was what progress we had made by the end on June on these accounts. A total of 3,103 were in the legal resolution process and in the case of 3,164 accounts we had made restructure offers, they were restructured or cured. Therefore, the figure we returned against the 20% target was 53%. That is the breakdown of it.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	26	What the committee is seeking is the further breakdown of these figures. With regard to the breakdown of the figure of 3,103 in the legal resolution process, what does that mean? For example, yesterday the AIB representatives said that for them it meant they sent a letter to people who had not made any payment or any contact in three years which stated yet again that they desired the customer to contact them or they would have to initiate legal proceedings. Second, in the case of the figure of 3,164, the committee is looking for the breakdown in terms of, for example, term extensions, interest only payments, debt for equity arrangements and so forth.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	27	Mr. Boucher, we are trying to do two things. One is to try to figure out if the bank has hit the target and get a breakdown of how that target has been met and then drill into the approaches to meeting these targets. We are very cognisant that there must be some similarity across the different banks with regard to the approaches they are making, for example, whether there is a similarity with regard to split mortgages and whether people in similar situations with different banks are being responded to in a similar fashion. That is what we are trying to establish; therefore, we must get the figures to ascertain how many split mortgages the bank has established, how many mortgages have been converted to rent and so forth. It is the specific resolutions rather than the macro resolution number that we need. We need that level of detail.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	28	Absolutely. I will respond to Deputy Donnelly. I did not see the full transcript of the meeting yesterday, but I can reaffirm that in Bank of Ireland's case we do not consider a resolution to be the bank having written to a customer. We have given our definition, which is a legal process. What we have said and what my colleague has just affirmed is that of the stock at the end of March, 27% had been offered a restructure at the end of June which we believe is sustainable. Another 26% are in the legal process, as we have defined it. I reiterate that in the legal process it is not our expectation that the process will go all the way. In fact, I would be extremely disappointed if it did. With regard to providing further information if it is of assistance, at the end of July - I am trying to give the figures which are as up to date as possible, but we can come back again to the stock - we had 2,881 accounts where we did not have an SFS.

It concerns the breakdown of the 3,164 split mortgages, etc. Can we get the answer to that question before we move on?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	35	I am trying to allow Mr. Boucher to finish his presentation, inclusive of that information.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	36	We will come back to that issue.  On slide 16, because the point is of relevance and interest, we show the challenged SME and corporate loans and the number of customers who have moved to a default scenario. With the indulgence of the committee, I will refer to slide 10 because part of its questions concerned what we were doing with SME customers. Defaulted loans at the end of June amounted to €2.9 billion, which is similar to the amount at the end of December in our Republic of Ireland SME lending book. As customers move in and out of default, I will refer to the December stock of defaulted loans at the end of June, which is a particular focus and for which we have set targets endorsed by the Central Bank. They are not public targets but ones we set for ourselves. It is also important to reiterate that we set our own targets for mortgages. Of the €2.9 billion at the end of June, we had restructured or resolved approximately 50%, while another 20% had offers outstanding. I expect our target which we have shared with the Central Bank is that of the €2.9 billion stock at the end of December, 90% will have been restructured or resolved or we will have offers with the customers. Excluding the €2.9 billion figure, in our accounts at the end of June, we provide information on SME corporate, commercial real estate and land and development loans not in default where we have provided for forbearance. Loans worth €1.3 billion to Irish SME customers at the end of June had been given forbearance without being in default prior to that happening. With regard to the bank's business as a whole, slide 17 reiterates the size and scale of our business, including the number of consumer business customers, those in our wealth management business, primarily in New Ireland Assurance, and SME and business customers. We have 250 branches and our branch footprint will broadly stay the same. We are investing heavily in our branch footprint. There is some reconfiguration, particularly in city centre branches and we are opening new branches. We have opened two new branches in the past six months and anticipate opening further branches as we look at where populations are moving. We are investing heavily in online banking, e-banking and other solutions for customers. This is I hope of benefit to the committee in respect of take-up. I can give an update on the slide's figures which refer to the first quarter. For the first half, based on Central Bank statistics released in the past week or so, Bank of Ireland accounts for approximately four out of ten new mortgages. In the life market we wrote about 24% of the new business. In terms of SME lending, excluding corporate lending and restructuring, Bank of Ireland accounts for over 50% of new SME lending. When we talk about statistics like this, we exclude restructures. When we say we have made loan offers to customers for new and increased lending, that excludes restructures. We have a figure of €1.9 billion in the first half of June. My colleague, Mr. Gerry Prizeman, is focused on getting to €4 billion. In terms of money drawn down, we have a figure of over 50% market share based on our own figures against the Central Bank of Ireland. The committee's primary focus is on our Irish business, but, given the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, it is important that we recognise our other businesses. We have a substantial business in Great Britain. We are the sole financial services provider for the British Post Office which has 11,500 branches. We have access to a bigger branch network than all of the other British banks combined. We have a significant corporate business in Ireland. We have 30% of the market and over 50% of the multinational corporations. We have been working with the Government and have a particular focus on public private partnerships, including the N11 and school bundles. We have brought our expertise, experience, capital and liquidity to that market. In respect of our key objectives, in summary, we are delivering against all of our key strategic objectives as shown on slide 20. Slide 21 shows our performance in the first half of 2012, the second half of 2012 and the first half of 2013. For all of our key financial metrics, with one or two small exceptions due to specific factors, we are showing strong momentum in our performance against our key objectives. Slide 22 shows the taxpayers' investment in Bank of Ireland, the cash returned to Bank of Ireland, the preference share stock the State holds in Bank of Ireland and the 15% shareholding. The bank's market capitalisation, as of last night, was at a figure of €6.7 billion. It has been a significant focus of the bank, in particular in the past four years, that where the taxpayers have supported Bank of Ireland, we will reduce the risk to the taxpayer, reward and repay the taxpayer. We also provide significant support for the economy, which is in our commercial interest. We raised capital in the private markets not because we had a problem but because the people who invested in us believed in the future of Ireland and Bank of Ireland.

Before doing so, what I really need from Mr. Boucher is some breakdown of the figure of 3,164 in the process. Can the Bank of Ireland team give us a breakdown in terms of the percentage who got term extensions, arrears capitalisation, reduced payments, are on interest-only payments as a long-term solution and have split mortgages? Is that figure available?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	38	I do not have that figure in detail for the end of June. We have tried to assist the committee in giving significant information from our accounts in a condensed format on slide 15. I ask Mr. Mason to talk about it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	39	We do not have the breakdown the Chairman is looking for, but the breakdown on page 15 gives the overall sense of the numbers and what the Chairman is looking for, in terms of forbearance offers that have been made and are in place, is not unlike the numbers on page 15. This includes capitalisation of arrears and term extensions.

That is the problem the committee has. We are trying to ensure consistency of approach, not that people will be given a pass to walk away from their obligations.People have obligations and we want to know how they are meeting them. We want to know, for example, why the type of split mortgage Bank of Ireland operates is different from those of most of the other financial institutions. How many of its people are getting that? Is Mr. Boucher telling the committee he does not have a breakdown of those figures?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	41	I hope that what we have provided in slide No. 15 is quite detailed.

Mr. Boucher is required to make returns to the Central Bank in respect of quarter 2. A return would have been made which included the detailed breakdown we seek. He is aware that AIB provided us with a breakdown yesterday. He is also very experienced. I would have thought the return filed with the Central Bank is on his files. To make it straightforward, I ask him to provide us with the figures so we can get on with our work. We are otherwise going to end up batting back and forth. He has the figures.

We also split the buy-to-let sector. Some 1,406 accounts are full interest. These are the actual figures from our accounts. We have set them out in full and give much more detail in the accounts.

On 23 August 2013, Bank of Ireland issued a press release on residential mortgage arrears and repossessions statistics for quarter 2 of 2013 which gave a detailed breakdown on the macro figure across the banks by sum and number.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	71	Slide No. 15 sets out the information we have. I will outline the information at total level.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	72	For the assistance of the committee, we are focusing in particular on the middle column in slide No. 15. My colleague will speak first about owner occupiers and will describe each category of them. I believe these figures are absolutely consistent with the information provided by the Central Bank. They are the absolute numbers from Bank of Ireland's point of view and have been verified prior to being set out in our accounts.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	73	In respect of owner occupier customers on full interest payments, 2,171 accounts were current or in early arrears, 1,406 were greater than 90 days in arrears or were impaired. A total of 3,577 owner occupiers were paying full interest. In respect of reduced repayments, we had 1,653 customers in the current or early arrears book and 1,180 in the default or impaired book for a total of 2,833. In respect of term extensions, 3,366 were in place in the current or early arrears book and 659 were in the default and impaired book for a total of 4,025. For capitalisation of arrears, 915 cases were in the current or early arrears book and 94 were in default, for a total of 1,009. The "other" category is composed largely of a combination of the preceding categories. The Chairman asked specifically about split mortgages. The Central Bank reported 337 split mortgages at the end of June, of which we had 226 or 67%. In respect of buy-to-let customers, 627 accounts were on full interest payments in the current book and 326 were in the default and impaired book for a total of 953. We had 536 arrangements in place for reduced repayments in the current and early arrears book and 209 in the default book for a total of 745. We had 787 term extensions in the current or early arrears book and 139 in the default book for a total of 926. There were 108 capitalisation of arrears in the current book and 50 in the default book for a total of 158. Again, the "other" category is a combination of the preceding categories which might, for example, involve a term extension and a capitalisation. I will not repeat the figures for the total.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	74	I will allow the members to try to drill down into these figures. I will raise a couple of issues before calling on Deputies Michael McGrath, O'Donnell and Doherty in sequence. Bank of Ireland is applying a different type of split mortgage to those offered by most of the other financial institutions. When a mortgage is split by other financial institutions, the interest and capital are warehoused for a specific period. The interest is not warehoused in Bank of Ireland's split mortgage and it remains on the live part of the debt. Why is Bank of Ireland taking that different approach?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	75	I cannot speak for the other banks but I am not sure that all of them are providing split mortgages. A split mortgage is one of a range of resolutions and the number of them is relatively small. However, Bank of Ireland has provided two thirds of the split mortgages. I can confirm, based on figures received last night, that during the month of July, Bank of Ireland put another 100 split mortgage accounts on the books. The number is increasing, therefore. From our perspective, we have to consider a wide range of options and issues. We have to bear in mind that any forbearance is a cost to the bank. If we do not receive amortisation or we agree to warehouse amortisation, we have to fund that in the market by raising deposits. If we consider Bank of Ireland in its own right and compare our arrears with the industry average, each of the banks has to deal with different issues.In Bank of Ireland's case, for owner-occupiers, our arrears are 53%. We have to bear in mind the cost of the provision of forbearance. One cannot look at it in isolation. If we do not recover the cost, we will not have the capital to lend into the economy or the income to repay and reward taxpayers. All of these things have to be taken into consideration. The vast bulk of our default customers are on tracker mortgages. We provided this information for the market at the end of August. The average yield or all-in rate associated with our tracker mortgage book - this relates to owner-occupiers - is 155 basis points. Other than in exceptional circumstances, we do not believe a restructure is possible if the customer cannot meet the full interest on the mortgage. We are prepared to bear the cost of warehousing. That is the rationale. I ask the committee to note the level of restructuring we offer. We were able to offer a restructuring option on foot of 80% of the standard financial statements we assessed during July.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	76	The approach being taken by each of the banks can be considered on a case by case basis. One can argue that the IBRC and AIB, both of which are splitting it completely, are in a different situation because they are completely owned by the State, whereas the State has a stakeholding of less than 15% in Bank of Ireland. The situation of a customer on a tracker mortgage and a customer on a mortgage with a variable interest rate is entirely different. Would Bank of Ireland consider offering customers on variable interest rates a type of split mortgage that is different from that offered to customers on tracker mortgages?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	77	We are reviewing our options on an ongoing basis.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	80	Customers who are receiving spilt mortgages with Bank of Ireland are paying interest on the warehoused side of these mortgages, regardless of whether they are on tracker or variable rates.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	81	The most important thing we do when we sit down with the customer is get him or her to complete a standard financial statement. We have to consider a form of restructuring that we believe is sustainable. The customer's repayment profile - the call on the customer's cash as he or she tries to meet his or her mortgage repayments - is a key factor in the sustainability of a restructure. We assess this and also stress the repayment. We make assumptions. The interest rate curve is very flat. The ECB is predicting that official interest rates will remain very flat for a period of time. We review on an ongoing basis whether each of our restructures is sustainable. In the case of a split mortgage, for example, we review at the end of three years whether it is still an appropriate structure for the customer in question. If, for example, interest rates were to move way beyond our current expectations and those of the market, we would have to sit down with the customer and decide whether that was still an appropriate structure for him or her.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	82	As this resolution process evolves - the target figure will move to 35% in October, 50% at the end of the year and we hope to 100% next year - the modelling of solutions will evolve alongside it and the financial climate will change also. I put it to Mr. Boucher, on the basis that Bank of Ireland deals with customers on a case by case basis and given that the bank is taking a different approach to split mortgages from some of the other financial institutions, that there is a case for looking at the split mortgage differently in the case of someone who is on a tracker mortgage with a very low interest rate and someone who is on a variable rate mortgage. There is quite a big difference between the repayments in each of these situations. If the bank continues to take a one-size-fits-all approach to split mortgages, without discriminating between those on variable rates and those on tracker rates, it will mean that people who have the same problem will be offered two entirely different solutions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	83	The customer will be on the tracker rate or the variable rate, as appropriate, on an ongoing basis. I assure the committee that we will review all our options to ensure we have the best solution that works for our customer. We will review this, but I cannot make a promise. I promise the committee that we will review it and that we will come back. I cannot commit the bank to doing something without making an assessment. I must stress-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	87	Yes.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	88	The bank has introduced split mortgages in the buy-to-let sector.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	89	Yes; some of the figures I gave the committee related to buy-to-let customers. Most of these cases involve owner-occupiers, but some of them involve buy-to-let customers also.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	90	To be helpful and give colour, I should mention that such cases typically involve people who have one buy-to-let property and whose arrears patterns and customer behaviours are more aligned to the owner-occupier book.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	91	I wish to deal with two other issues in the six or seven minutes that are left before I call Deputy Michael McGrath. Recently, the Insolvency Service of Ireland contacted Bank of Ireland and the other financial institutions with regard to the consultative process for personal insolvency arrangements, etc. The issue of a payment break is being considered as part of that process. The incomes of people in resolution processes are accounted for. A certain amount is used to service debt and a certain amount is used to pay household bills, etc. Payment breaks are designed for people who encounter emergencies such as bereavements. The family car might need to be changed or a child might be making his or her Confirmation. People might need that money immediately, but they do not have it to hand. I would like the representatives of Bank of Ireland to explain how they see payment breaks being managed. I am not sure what is the level of architecture in place. If a person who pays €1,000 a month to Bank of Ireland as part of the resolution process qualifies for an emergency payment of €3,000, how can he or she receive that €3,000 without defaulting on the resolution programme with Bank of Ireland?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	92	We always ask our customers to talk to us if they find themselves in emergencies. That gives us an opportunity to accommodate them and ensure they do not go into arrears. The Chairman is asking whether we would adjust one of our forbearance options to accommodate someone who encounters an emergency. We would do so as that would be the practical thing to do. When we put forbearance solutions in place for our customers, we make sure they do not come down to the last euro. We ensure our customers have the flexibility they need to deal with small emergencies that arise. If the forbearance arrangements put in place are too minimal in the way they are applied and too tight for customers, it will be very difficult for them to stick to them. We try to make them as flexible as possible. We ask customers to talk to us if they are experiencing difficulties like those mentioned by the Chairman in order that we can put a changed arrangement in place.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	93	We are actually doing it. There is a particular technical issue involved, but I do not want to bore the committee with it. If a new arrangement in these circumstances is counted as a redefault on the part of the customer, it has different capital implications for the bank. It is something that would be necessary and appropriate for us to re-assess if it became of significant scale. We are offering it. As Mr. Mason said, we do not wish to have it too tight. Obviously, we have to maximise the recovery of our own money. It is not in our interests for a customer to fall back into an arrears category simply because we failed to take account of a particular emergency. As a business person, it is my job to run a commercial operation. It is in our commercial interests to restructure as many customers as we can and provide for flexibility in emergencies. We do this with business customers and corporate clients.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	94	The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, wrote to all the banks and financial institutions on 9 July. The Minister made some comments in the letter about the possibility of a banking inquiry taking place. He said it was important to bear in mind that although the guarantee was provided in September 2008, records dating from the years preceding the granting of the guarantee and records dating from after the guarantee might both be of relevance to any inquiry.In doing so, he asked all the banks to take all necessary steps to ensure that all records within the relevant institution, whether comprising documents, audio recordings or in other formats, were preserved to be available for an anticipated inquiry. This was a standard letter, which issued to all the banks and all of them, including Bank of Ireland, wrote back. There is a notable difference in the response from Bank of Ireland, which was written by Mr. Archie Kane on 10 July 2013, and the responses of the other banks. All the letters contain a general acknowledgement. The language used in the Bank of Ireland letter appears to imply that the bank has reservations regarding the Minister's request. I propose to tease out this matter. Mr. Kane confirmed that Bank of Ireland would take all such steps as it reasonably could to retain and maintain records believed to be within the remit of the anticipated inquiry. In Mr. Boucher's view, what are reasonable records and what would be reasonable behaviour in retaining such records?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	95	I will speak, in particular, about two elements of records. In terms of all written documentary records, we have provided huge documentary evidence of board meetings, memorandums, etc., to a number of commissions, including the Nyberg commission. We have a huge data room of written documentation and e-mails. We also have ongoing interaction with the Bank of England, Federal Reserve, Central Bank of Ireland, British Government and a wide range of other actors. Therefore, we have the documentation. In the context of tape recordings, it is important to understand, in Bank of Ireland's case, how tape recordings are taken. They arise in two of our activities. We have a call centre that is online 365 days of the year, which customers will ring to speak to experienced but relatively junior officials to carry out minor transactions. This includes where a customer will call to obtain an account balance, order a cheque book, etc. These calls to our call centres are recorded, primarily to allow us to monitor quality, service and training and ascertain whether our colleagues are answering calls in the appropriate fashion and on time, whether we are giving the appropriate information and if there are spikes in queries coming from customers. We can then ask whether we have an issue with a process and assist the call centres. We also have dealing rooms where transactions are agreed over the telephone and confirmed in writing the following day. This could be where one of our staff will agree to sell a customer €1 million for sterling at 87 pence per euro.

He is seeking information that may be relevant to a banking inquiry, for example, issues related to the bank guarantee and records of communications between the banks regarding balance sheets. The response received from all the other banks stated categorically that they would take the necessary steps. However, Bank of Ireland chose to state it would do what it reasonably could, which implies it is taking a different approach from the other banks. I would like to hear categorically from Mr. Boucher that Bank of Ireland will safely hold every record, whether an audio recording, a document or in some other manifestation, for use in the event of an inquiry or inquiries taking place in future.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	97	Absolutely. I just wanted to provide a context for telephone recordings in the bank.

For the second day in a row, we have had a series of numbers thrown at us during the course of a meeting. As I stated yesterday, it is incredibly difficult for members to process this data, put it in context and frame appropriate questions. The information should have been provided in advance of the meeting. I acknowledge the information provided in table 15, which I will address in a moment. My understanding of the current position in respect of the data is that we do not have a breakdown of the 3,164 offers that were made in the second quarter of 2013, whereas we have a breakdown on page 15 of the forbearance measures in place as of the end of June.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	99	I apologise for interrupting Deputy McGrath. I will do my best to get the numbers to the Deputy. As a public company, any numbers that we place in the public domain must go through a verification process. I will have the numbers forwarded to the Deputy. I hope the information we have provided is comprehensive, both in our accounts and in the summary. We summarised to try to assist the joint committee. The accounts are public information. We will arrange to provide the specific information to the Deputy. The reason I cannot do so now is that we have to go through a verification process. I will get the information to the committee.

I am seeking to clarify the issue and have Mr. Boucher confirm that we are not in a position to do an analysis of the offers made in quarter two of this year, whereas we are in a position to do an analysis of the forbearance arrangements and otherwise that have been agreed in respect of Bank of Ireland's arrears book as of the end of June. The relevant information is provided in table 15. Is that the position?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	101	That is correct
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	102	My general point is that this highlights how flawed this process has been from the beginning. Yesterday, one of the pillar banks informed the joint committee that issuing 6,000 letters telling its customers to engage or it would go down the road of legal action constitutes a sustainable solution to their mortgage difficulties. Today, the second pillar bank informs us that it does not consider correspondence containing a legal threat to be a sustainable solution under the definition in the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets programme. This highlights the flawed nature of the process from the beginning. The vague definition of a sustainable solution in the arrears targets programme published in March last gives the banks the final say in that the definition provides that the bank must be satisfied that the arrangement provides a sustainable solution. Allied Irish Banks is satisfied that issuing a threatening legal letter is a sustainable solution, whereas Bank of Ireland takes a different view. The joint committee is trying to make some sense of all this. I would feel sorry for the Central Bank were it not the culpable party in that it framed the terms of reference in the first instance. That is essentially the position from my perspective. It is farcical that the two main banks in the State have been given a definition which they can interpret completely differently, as they have done. More than 70% of the so-called sustainable offers made by Allied Irish Banks were legal letters which Bank of Ireland states do not constitute a sustainable solution.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	103	I am sorry for interrupting. I wish to confirm that a legal letter from a solicitor is our definition. I do not want there to be any misapprehension. In our definition, a legal letter is a letter from a solicitor. It is not a repossession threat or something like that.

The letters Mr. Boucher describes are much different from the 6,000 letters to which Allied Irish Banks referred yesterday.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	105	I cannot comment as I am not aware of the AIB process.

In terms of analysing Bank of Ireland's treatment of arrears cases, the middle two columns of the table on page 15 provide a breakdown of 3,603 accounts which are in arrears of 90 days or more and the arrangements that are in place in respect of these accounts. That is the information that we can analyse.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	107	Yes. If the Deputy does not mind, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Mason, whether he believes the information we will provide as soon as we can will show a materially different pattern from the pattern in the data before us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	108	These are the forbearance solutions that we offer. I am confident, therefore, that the information will be consistent with the information provided on page 15.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	109	We will send the affirmation figures, but for the sake of the Deputy's questioning, one can make a reasonable assumption that the quarter two forbearance options in place will be broadly consistent with the information before us.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	110	Generally speaking, if I were to characterise the data, they show typical forbearance measures, namely, interest only repayments, reduced payments, term extensions and the capitalisation of arrears. There are also 264 accounts in the category of "Other". How many of this latter category are split mortgages for owner-occupiers? Mr. Mason indicated the overall figure was 226.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	111	I do not have a breakdown of the figures but between 30 and 40 of the accounts in this category are probably buy-to-let accounts. The majority relate to owner-occupier accounts.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	112	Spilt mortgages account for as many as 200 of the 264 accounts in this category, with the balance made up of a combination of the other measures.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	113	To be clear, the split mortgage could either be in the good book or the default book. Some part or other of it will be split. If we have done a split and capitalised the arrears, it will be back in the good book.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	114	In that scenario would it be in the first two columns?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	115	Yes.

All the talk is being picked up on the microphones and is interfering with the responses to questions.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	118	We are not in a position to analyse the offers, but Bank of Ireland has indicated they will be in a similar vein to the measures that have been agreed and by and large they are the typical forbearance measures. Bank of Ireland has begun to roll out the split mortgages. Is it doing debt for equity arrangements of any kind yet?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	119	No, but we are continuing to look at that. There is a particular capital issue in regard to debt for equity, particularly under the Basel III rules, because where equity is involved in a situation, the capital requirement is probably eight to nine times what it is for a loan. We will look at debt for equity, but there is a technical issue for a debt for equity swap. If we take equity as part of a swap, for example for a corporate body, we provide fully against that. Therefore, we make a provision up front. That is our policy. Where equity is provided in a distress scenario, we provide up front for it.

How many were there in the buy-to-let sector at that stage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	123	Approximately 1,943, but the Deputy would be aware the majority of those would be in the receiver category. At the end of June, we had 1,265 - the majority - where we either had receivers appointed or were in the process of appointing receivers. That will account for many of our resolutions regarding buy-to-let properties.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	124	Let us focus for a moment on the owner-occupier properties. Approximately 3,100 of these were involved in legal-resolution processes. Has that figure changed much or is that pretty much the ball park figure for the number currently involved?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	125	I am sorry the figures are not exactly consistent, but I do not think that by the end of July a huge change would have occurred. With regard to the legal resolutions, at the end of July demand letters would have been issued for 1,400. A solicitor's letter would have issued, which is the early stage of the process. With regard to owner occupiers, at the end of July unexecuted possession orders numbered 108 and civil bills numbered 224.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	126	At the end of June, the figure of 3,100 meant there was formal, legal correspondence under way between the borrower and the banks. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	127	These were at some stage in the legal process. I will ask Mr. Mason to comment further on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	128	In the vast majority of cases we have agreed a resolution with the customer. However, if it is legal process, it relates to where we have involved a solicitor and the demand for possession has issued. That is what the majority are.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	129	So there is a strong chance in the majority of those cases that the house will be forfeited, either by voluntary surrender or -----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	130	No, that is certainly not what we hope. If we return to our process, we go through a significant process with customers, where we try to get them to engage with us and to complete a standard financial statement, SFS, for us. We do this by way of phone contact and written correspondence. If the customers do not do this and do not provide us with the information we require to make a restructure offer to them, we go into what we call our non-co-operating process, where we write to customers and give them more time to try to give us the information. We tell them at that stage that if they do not give us the information, we will have no choice but to go into the legal process. What the Deputy sees with the numbers here are customers where we have had no choice but to go into the legal process. However, we are hopeful, and have seen evidence, that some customers will start to engage and to provide the information required at that stage. Therefore, it would not be right to say that all of these properties will end up in legal repossession.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	131	I ask the Chairman to bear in mind that in regard to late arrears, I referred in particular to the SFSs and to assessing these in July. This was to indicate that when customers engage with us, we believe that in 80% of cases we can reach a resolution with that customer. In the case of approximately 10% of them, we feel the original contracted mortgage is affordable, but another 10% move to a potentially different category. We had 2,880 SFSs outstanding. In regard to these, we say to customers that whatever their reason for not engaging with the bank, they have made a decision not to engage. That decision not to engage leaves us and the customer with a much narrower range of options. Those options are not available and we then have to move down the legal route.

On the issue of split mortgages, some 309 were agreed across the sector by the end of June, 226 of which were agreed by Bank of Ireland. Sorry, this includes buy-to-let properties.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	133	The figure of 309 refers to owner-occupier mortgages, but there is an element of buy-to-let mortgages split in the figures.

I suggest that the Bank of Ireland split mortgage is not really a split mortgage in the sense that it is another form of paying interest plus some capital, because it means the customer pays interest every month on the warehoused portion and paying interest and capital on the other part of the mortgage on the usual annuity basis. It is another form of interest plus capital, although Bank of Ireland says it will review after a period of time how the warehoused portion will be treated.

The example given in that report was one where the interest would roll up. That is not what we have done. We have decided to structure it in a way where the interest is being paid and the customer is making reductions on the capital on a monthly basis.

In order to be fair to customers who are already in arrears or financial distress, if the bank is going to offer a split mortgage, it would be far more sustainable for the customers if interest did not accrue on the warehoused portion of the debt. I have dealt with individual cases where, when the interest on the warehoused portion is included, the split mortgage is not a viable product for the customer. I am surprised Bank of Ireland is providing the majority of split mortgages that have been taken up. Some of the people involved may not have had the best advice.

Other CEOs have commented that in their view up to 20% of the mortgage arrears book is accounted for by those who choose not to pay their mortgage for one reason or another. Is that Bank of Ireland's experience?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	141	First of all, for the purposes of communication, for our accounts and as a public company, when there is a definition we can set out matters under a definition. We do not have a definition of a strategic default and therefore, I cannot provide figures. We do not do measures on that basis. What we try to demonstrate is the number of customers. For example, in the example we gave of our late arrears, we stated that 2,880 of such customers in the owner-occupier sector had not completed an SFS. Let us be careful to say that this 2,880 might mean that a customer has just moved into the late arrears sector, so it may not be the case that these are strategic defaults. To return to our experience, which is all I can speak about, I must point out our arrears are 53% of the owner-occupier sector. The number of our total default customers, an amount of €3.9 billion, is vastly different from some of our competitors in terms of quantum and proportion. However, if we go to SFSs we assessed in the month of July, which broadly speaking appear to be consistent with the year to date, we can offer a restructure in 80% of cases. They may be customers who are not engaging with us for a variety of reasons, but I do not know the reasons. It is not possible for us to get into the heads of individual customers on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. If they do not engage, we have a limited choice. 
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	142	Overall, the bank is making progress when we look at the usual banking metrics of loan to deposit ratio and funding mix, etc. One concern I still have is whether Bank of Ireland and the other banks are fully facing up to the losses they are carrying on the mortgage book and the SME book. I have examined Bank of Ireland's impairment provisions in its accounts and in the presentation, which are based on certain assumptions and are only valid based on those assumptions.Mr. Boucher might address that point. How confident is he that the bank's provisions are adequate and that there will not be a need for additional capital in the short or medium term? Will he address the issue of the Government preference shares from 2009? Bank of Ireland is facing a cliff or an issue in March next year, when they either have to be repaid or the bank will have to come up with some other formula. Will Mr. Boucher comment on this and the options which are being explored?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	143	A question was asked about our loan loss provisions. Our provisions are made on an international financial reporting standards, IFRS, accounting basis. What gives us comfort and substance to our belief is that we look at the diversification of the Bank of Ireland portfolio, the different geographies in which we operate and the mix of our loan books, all of which I hope are helpfully set out for the committee on the slide we provided. We look at the different mixes and diversifications. Then we look at our assumptions - is the number of customers who are defaulting increasing or starting to slow down? Again, we have tried to demonstrate for the committee that the number of customers who are defaulting is reducing, as is, therefore, the size of the issue. Then, we consider the collateral. What are our assumptions behind the collateral? In the United Kingdom and Ireland, in particular, we see that the collateral values are stabilising. Our assumption for owner-occupier mortgages has a peak-to-trough difference of 55%, which seems to be a valid assumption. It is different in different parts of the country. Ours is a universal bank and we have loans throughout the country. We probably have a slightly different mix in certain more challenged sectors and areas and that is identified in our owner-occupier and buy-to-let arrears relative to the industry. For commercial real estate in Ireland, we assume a peak-to-trough fall in our base case of 67%. That is a heavy assumption. How do we, as a board, satisfy ourselves on the issue of capital? We go through an internal strenuous process which we term an ICAAP process. It is an internal capital assessment which we share with the Central Bank. For our base case, we use the consensus economic assumptions regarding unemployment, collateral values, interest rates, etc. and do a five-year model on that basis.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	145	I am sorry if I am taking too much time. This is an important point because it comes at the heart of the question from taxpayers, that is, whether Bank of Ireland has enough capital. That is our base case. An important part of our capital assessment is what we call the stress scenario - if things are a good deal worse than anyone envisages. We look at the stress scenarios applied by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. In particular, we looked at the stress scenarios evident in the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, process for 2011. We used these for the assessment. The question is whether, even in a stress scenario, we would have sufficient capital. One of the things that is important to us in a stress scenario is the contingent capital instrument. This bails in, that is, converts to equity, at 8.25% if our ratios fall below 8.25%. In our stress scenario which looks at the quantum of difference between the profit in a stress scenario and a basic scenario used in the PCAR, we do not trigger it. I cannot ever say that, no matter what, we have enough capital, but based on the base case and our stress scenario we believe we are adequately capitalised. The issue of the preference shares was raised and, again, it is important that we note it. The preference shares have a redemption step-up. The instrument is a perpetual instrument. When the preference shares were put in place in 2009, there was an incentive to redeem. Given that it is a perpetual instrument, it counts as capital on that basis and the coupon rate is 10.25%. Should the preference shares remain in the State's hands at the end of March, the redemption premium will trigger. However, at the end of March 2014 there will be no change to our capital and there is no payment due. The payment is due if and when we redeem. That is important from a capital assessment point of view. We are working with the Government on the options available to us. I cannot talk about these options because during the past four years when we have come to the market, we have thought through the solution carefully and engaged with all the appropriate people. It is a capital instrument and, therefore, we need to discuss it with other relevant authorities. We are hoping we will come to the market as soon as we can but with a solution rather than our thoughts.

I am pleased that Bank of Ireland has an operating profit, but to cut to the chase I am dissatisfied with what has happened this morning. Mr. Boucher is not facilitating the committee to enable us to do the work we are supposed to do, that is, to examine the position in quarter two and see exactly the type of sustainable solutions and offers the bank has made. Mr. Boucher has referred to what is stated on page 15. Full interest payments do not form part of that mix. The bank would have been required to file a return with the Central Bank regarding the offers it had made in quarter two, which totalled 6,267. It would then have been required to give a detailed breakdown of the restructuring figure - 3,164. In the era of the Internet and e-mails the bank should have provided us with these figures this morning. It is not good enough to use the explanation or excuse that the bank is a publicly-quoted company, as is Allied Irish Banks, but it's representatives provided us with the figures yesterday. The point I am making is simple. We want to see the figures. It is nothing personal. Our job as a committee is to examine the figures for quarter two to see the details for the figure of 6,267, or 53%, which is to be welcomed. We want to drill down. The bank should give us a breakdown of the figure of 3,164 for restructuring. I believe it should be able to provide us with the figures now.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	148	We have given the figures to the end of June. I cannot give the exact numbers, but what we have said is that the figures for the quarter to the end of June will be broadly similar to the stock at the end of June. I cannot tell the committee that it is exactly to the nth degree, but I am telling it-----

Mr. Boucher has referred us to page 15 and the residential mortgages heading, which is what we are looking at. The number of accounts in arrears for more than 90 days to which this applies is 3,603. Of these, 1,406 are full interest accounts. That does not fall within the terms of looking at sustainable solutions in quarter two. The committee is entitled to a breakdown of the 3,164 restructuring figure and know whether it is made up of the capitalisation of arrears, term extensions, trade downs, mortgage-to-rent arrangements, split mortgages, voluntary repossessions, cash flow help or mortgages that are deemed to be affordable. This is like being in a maze. We are chasing Mr. Boucher around the place, but I would prefer if he simply sat still for one minute and gave us the figures in order that we can get on with our work such that we can interact in a constructive way rather than speak on macro issues, although I do not deny that they are important. Our job today is to look at the figure of 3,164 for restructuring and the legal process. We also need to know-----

Will Mr. Boucher provide us with a breakdown of the 3,164 figure? I believe we are entitled to it now and that the public is entitled to it. How does Bank of Ireland define the legal process? Does it mean letters going out and so forth? I believe Mr. Boucher has the make-up of the 3,164 figure, but for whatever reason he is reluctant to provide us with it. This is very simple. He should show us the figures.

Without information relating to the figure of 3,164, we cannot do our work. I believe the bank has access to that information and obtaining it would involve nothing more than Mr. Boucher e-mailing a request to someone in his office. We could then get on with our work. Consideration should be given to doing that now. What is the position with regard to the legal process?

I will not waste time going over old ground. However, I concur with Deputy O'Donnell with regard to a simple matter being made complicated. We are trying to measure Bank of Ireland against a certain metric and we are finding it difficult to do so in the absence of the information required. What criteria apply with regard to the issuing of legal letters? What level of arrears must accrue or how much time must pass before one of these letters is sent? AIB informed us that approximately three years' worth of repayments must be owed before it will issue a letter. In rough terms, the same amount of time must pass in the context of someone not engaging with the bank. Is Bank of Ireland's process the same? Will Mr. Boucher provide an update on where Bank of Ireland stands in the context of implementing the recommendations of the Mercer report? We discussed with the chief executive of AIB, the pensions of former executives. Has Bank of Ireland sought voluntary contributions from the pension funds of former senior bank officials? Mr. Boucher referred to the bank's branch structure. Will he expand on what he said and indicate where more branches are going to be closed? Will he indicate the areas in which he sees room for growth in the bank's network of branches? Goodbody has estimated that Bank of Ireland will be writing down approximately 9% of mortgages in arrears. Will Mr. Boucher provide some detail on the number of such mortgages the bank expects to write down? I am somewhat confused with regard to a certain aspect of Bank of Ireland's submission. I refer to page 15. What is the position with regard to voluntary sales whereby people are informed that the only option is to voluntarily sell their homes? I do not view that as being voluntary at all. In addition, what is the position with regard to the mortgage-to-rent figure? Will Mr. Boucher indicate the number of people who have been informed that they must engage in what are termed "voluntary sales"?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	177	Those are forbearances. What the Deputy is seeking is a breakdown with regard to people who are in the legal or resolution process. This is a breakdown of forbearances.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	178	AIB included a figure for voluntary sales in its submission. As Deputy Michael McGrath indicated earlier, we face a difficulty here in that we are comparing apples and oranges in terms of what banks consider to be part of the resolution process. Obviously, Bank of Ireland does not include that as a measure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	179	It is not included in our forbearance options. However, we do have voluntary sales and voluntary surrenders of properties. For example, in our half-year accounts to June we talked about 76 properties that had come into possession and 75% of them were voluntary. We do give that information. It is just that it is not in the forbearance.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	181	Either 70 or 76 properties came into possession and 75% of these were voluntary.

I refer to the work being done by Bank of Ireland's regional and branch managers in respect of credit clinics. I have attended two such clinics in County Wicklow and they were extremely positive in nature. There is a need for an increase in the number of these clinics. I am very much on board with the idea of businesses needing to know that the bank has money available to lend. I acknowledge the work being done in respect of these clinics. The latter constitute a positive development.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	183	We have completed about 100 in the past six months and we will commit to completing more, going forward, over the rest of the year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	185	On the legal process, I do not have a breakdown in terms of how long people would be in arrears. First of all, however, everything we do is in compliance with CCMA. So it will be after the CCMA timelines have elapsed. In addition, it will be after significant attempts to contact the customer, as I outlined earlier, by phone and by letter by our centralised collections unit and our localised collectors. It will be after we have spoken to customers in terms of our non-co-operating strategy, which I also outlined earlier. When that is exhausted and we have not obtained the information we require in order to make a forbearance decision, then we will hand it to a solicitor to make a demand for possession. That is what we classify as legal process.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	186	On accounting write-offs, at the end of June the amounts written off for residential mortgages, which includes our Irish and UK mortgage books - the vast majority would relate to our UK mortgage business - was €20 million. That is from an accounting write-off point of view, the sale of the collateral and the completion of the other processes to maximise the recovery. For non-property SME and corporate, the figure was €114 million. For property and construction, the figure was €51 million. For consumer credit, the figure was €45 million. That makes accounting write-offs of €230 million for the six months to the end of June. For the branches, we may be counter-intuitive. We believe that we have done the raising of the capital, the restructuring of our balance sheet and the reduction in our costs. We have a huge focus on the generation of revenue. We are investing heavily in e-banking, mobile banking and our infrastructure. However, we believe the branch is a very important way for us to engage with our customers. We have 250 branches. I cannot say whether next week we will have 249 and the following week 251. That is our broad idea of our footprint. Obviously, we write to our customers. In certain city centre locations we have done branch consolidations. There are other issues to do with the building but we closed our branch in Donnybrook and amalgamated it with the branch in Ranelagh. Those two branches were located approximately 1 km from each other. We recently opened two branches at Dublin City University, DCU, and Dublin Airport. We have plans to open further branches but this is a commercially sensitive matter because we are involved in negotiations either with landlords or over location. We will be opening further branches where we see the population is moving. We see the branches as an extremely important part of our engagement with customers.

With regard to the Government's ownership of an equity stake in Bank of Ireland, that is not something to which I can speak. The fact that the taxpayer is in a profit over its investment in Bank of Ireland is obviously important to us. It is important to the taxpayer, but that is a matter for the Minister and the National Pensions Reserve Fund so I cannot speak to that. With regard to the civil bills-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	215	I think it comes back to the figure of 3,103. The majority of those cases are in the legal process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	220	We are broadly following the same criteria. With SMEs there is sometimes more complexity involved. One can have other banks involved and there is a range of other revenues and income streams. What I disclosed relates to defaulted loans of €2.9 billion. We have a range of outcomes. We are moving through them. We have another 20% of offers as of this morning and we expect to have 90%.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	222	The bank is trying to play the committee for fools. That is simply not acceptable. The witnesses mentioned that they had listened to some of the transcripts from yesterday. I am sure other members of the bank listened. The Chairman made very clear what we wanted. The figures have not been provided. The witnesses have given a very good presentation and I commend them on it. I also commend the bank on some of the achievements it has made on the markets and the loan-to-deposit ratio. There are a lot of positives about which we could talk but the purpose of the committee meeting is to focus on mortgage arrears. The bank has provided us with a lot of figures but the document with which we have not been provided relates to the other figure. The bank is trying to play us as fools and to tell us that what is provided is what the committee has sought. I will go into the detail of what we have and what information has been provided orally to date. The first point relates to table 15, which the bank says is what is in place until the end of quarter 2 in June 2013. Is it correct that they are forbearance measures which could have arisen as far back as 2008?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	223	Yes, they are forborne accounts.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	224	Some of these measures such as full interest, for example, could have been measures the bank has agreed with the customers in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 – over a period of five years. The Central Bank and the Government have asked about offers for accounts that were in arrears of 90 days or more as of this year. To make it clear to the witnesses, that is why the figures do not correlate in any shape or form with the information the committee wants. The Government and the Central Bank have asked the banks to do certain things and have said they will impose penalties in terms of the banks' provisions if they do not comply with the 20% target. They are talking about long-term solutions and long-term offers that had to be provided up to 20% by the end of quarter 1. It was mentioned that in quarter 2, 6,267 offers were made. Are those figures correct for quarter 2?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	225	It is based on our default balance at the end of March and shows what the position was at the end of June. That is the figure I gave.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	226	Am I correct in saying that at the end of March, 11,774 owner-occupier customers with Bank of Ireland were in arrears of 90 days or more?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	227	The number relates to accounts so the number of customers would be less.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	228	Yes, so that is how many were in arrears at that point in time. Between that time and the end of June, 6,267 offers were made, of which 3,103 were legal.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	229	Some of the legal processes would have started before that. We were asked for the position in June of those accounts that were in default at the end of March. We were given a minimum figure we had to have achieved.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	230	Some processes started earlier but in June there were 6,267, which the bank claims is 53%. Half of all of the long-term solutions being put forward by the bank could potentially lead to repossession. Legal letters were sent that threaten repossession.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	231	I do not think that is the case.

They are legal letters that threaten repossession.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	233	That is a potential but I do not believe that the outcome would be anywhere near that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	235	We do not regard a legal process as a solution. We have requirements to restructure our mortgages, to identify end-state solutions. What we try to do is say “Yes” in accordance with the Central Bank. What counts can be where a legal process commences but in Bank of Ireland what we focus on is how many restructures we can do. We do not believe that a legal process is something that we would like to do. I am not treating the committee in the way Deputy Doherty described. I am trying to give as much information as I possibly can to give colour behind the figures.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	236	I completely disagree. I will move on. In regard to the restructuring, Mr. Boucher mentioned that of the 3,164 cases – again, he has not given us the figures for the quarter – that have been restructured, offered a restructuring or have been resolved between the end of quarter 1 and quarter 2, the type of restructuring that has been offered or is in place is similar to the trend that is in place in table 15.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	237	To the stock.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	238	To the stock. If we look at the trend in what is in place in table 15, the majority are interest-only mortgages for a short duration and also interest with a reduced capital. Mr. Boucher mentioned that none of them involve a reduction in interest across the entire period of the loan. They are short-term solutions. It is my understanding that the Central Bank will not accept interest-only as a long-term solution, in particular not of the magnitude presented. If Mr. Boucher could suggest that interest-only would be a long-term solution and there is a genuine belief by the bank that for some reason the customer would be able to pay interest and capital in two years or three years’ time, it would be seen as a long-term solution, but to rely on more than a third of the solutions as interest-only would not be accepted by the Central Bank. That is the position based on the information I have received. I am not sure whether Mr. Boucher followed the transcripts yesterday but when the CEO of AIB, Mr. David Duffy, presented to the committee on the breakdown of its offers, he did not include interest-only because he mentioned that the Central Bank would not accept that as a long-term solution.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	241	Just to be clear, what we are talking about is when we have gone through a process with a customer. The processes are detailed and involve sitting down with customers. We have completed standard financial statements, SFSs. The documents are very comprehensive. A banker has spent some time with the customer going through the process and we have a full understanding of the customer’s circumstances and we put what we believe is a sustainable solution in place for the customer that will work over the long term. Some customers have issues that are short term and we solve them.Some customers, as the Deputy suggests, would be included in our long-term resolutions where they are able to pay interest only for a period, for example, somebody who has children in college. One can clearly see their difficulty. The difficulty is that for two or three years an arrangement is made with that customer that they would make a reduced repayment for that period and afterwards step back up the capital and interest payments when the issue that is causing the difficulty for the next couple of years has been resolved. What we try to do is accommodate our solutions to the circumstances of individual people.

Even today across the financial institutions, one in four restructurings are failing. In the past almost half of all restructurings were failing. The point is that the Central Bank no longer wants short-term restructurings; it wants long-term restructuring. If, for example, one third of these offers are interest only, is Mr. Mason convinced that the Central Bank will accept them as long-term restructuring as defined by it?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	245	Clearly, I cannot accept some of the statements the Deputy has made about the banking industry as a whole as applying to Bank of Ireland.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	246	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	247	However, if I say that at the end of December we had 4,780 customers moved out of restructures, as we set out on the slides, in an effort to be helpful, in the vast majority of those cases the customer is now in a position where they are on an acceptable repayment basis that they can live with and we can live with. They have moved out of restructures. The Bank of Ireland restructures do work. We look at the profile of our book and where we are in this process. We are not perfect. We are continuing to learn. We are continuing to do it. We get significant advice and help from third parties. Mr. Mason is continuing to learn but if we come to the proof of the pudding, are our restructures sticking and as people exit from the restructuring? If we look at where we are in Bank of Ireland, and I suspect for the industry as a whole, I cannot absolutely predict how many of those restructures there will be because it will come over time. In our accounts at the end of June, the Central Bank required us to remove assumptions we had made on cure rates so we took a charge, through our profit and loss, for a change to our provision stock. That has already happened. We believe that cure rates will come in line with our expectations but we have taken provisional charge against that already.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	248	If I could add that the Central Bank will be coming into the bank and into the other banks in quarter four, we believe, to verify the figures and to go through the figures we have supplied, so there is another part of the process to be gone through.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	249	I understand that. The figures the committee would like are the figures Mr. Mason presented to the Central Bank at the end of quarter two. Regarding some other issues, I want to add, in terms of the split mortgage, that the products the bank has on split mortgages are wrong. We had AIB representatives before the committee yesterday. They are modifying their split mortgage in terms of a lifetime interest in the mortgage but they do not charge interest and Bank of Ireland should seriously look at that and come back to the committee and customers on it. I have some other questions. In regard to the question of strategic defaulters raised by Deputy McGrath, and I know Bank of Ireland does not have a strategic default definition, AIB has defined strategic defaulters as those who can pay their mortgage after the bank has looked at their financial statements that they have submitted to the bank and after the bank has deducted reasonable living expenditures, which are the insolvency service's living expenditure guideline plus 20%. It was interesting that when Mr. Boucher provided figures in regard to the analysis of July's 1,487 financial statements from customers, he said that 149 of them were deemed to be able to pay. Of AIB's analysis of the financial statements, 20% were deemed to be able to pay. For Bank of Ireland, 10% were deemed to be able to pay. What is the underlying formula Bank of Ireland is using? What are the living expenditures? Is it based on the insolvency service's guideline and why is it at half the level of AIB?

The statistics, based on public information, as our arrears profile, as our relative defaults, when assets were transferred to NAMA, may talk to original underwriting - we have made a lot of mistakes - and also the work that we have been trying to do, and continue to do, over the last few months - that may be some of the explanation, but I will ask Mr. Mason to deal with the question on the guidelines, etc.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	251	This is something we have been doing for a couple of years now so we have a lot of customer information in terms of what is reasonable expenditure. We did look originally at what the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, was doing. We looked originally at the research done by Trinity College and the Vincentian Partnership. We have looked at what the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, has come out with as well, and we consulted the ISI. What we have are guidelines but what we need to do is sit down and understand an individual customer's circumstances. Some customers, for example, will have medical expenses that others will not have. Some customers will be travelling further to work than other customers. All that needs to be taken into account and it is very hard to say that one customer is exactly the same as another. The detailed process we go through takes that into account. We do have guidelines. We do not apply them too strictly because what we want to put in place are forbearance structures that will work for customers.

I do not want to use the term "strategic defaulters" but what he basically said is that when the financial statements are analysed, they believe that 20% can pay their mortgages. Bank of Ireland's figure for that, after analysing the statement, is 10%. Would that be correct?

In the case of 12 of those, they were deemed affordable. Again, to help, I will give the year to date figure for buy-to-let. The forbearance assessments in the year to date for buy-to-let were 1,950 based on the receipt of information from the customers. Forbearance assessments offered were 1,456. That is the year to date to the end of July. Forbearance requests declined as affordable were 149.

I appreciate that. The last two points require a quick "yes" or "no" answer. The bank has residents in Priory Hall. AIB said it got out of the process.

At some stage somebody else might pick that up. Regarding the Mercer report, Mr. Boucher has answered the question. On 23 April, the Taoiseach said he expected senior executives to take substantial reductions. I have a confidential note here from the Minister for Finance's advisers on Mr. Boucher's own remuneration that was voted upon at the AGM, which I got from a freedom of information request. It states: "I think it would be inappropriate for us to endorse the director's remuneration at this time." How many of the 1,200 staff at Bank of Ireland who have packages above €100,000 took a base reduction in their salary as a result of the Mercer report? Can Mr. Boucher inform the committee if he and his directors lived up to the Taoiseach's expectation that they would take a substantial reduction in their pay as a result of the Mercer report? I believe he expected the response within two weeks after that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	262	In terms of the Mercer report, the specific request that the Minister, as a shareholder, made to us was to identify the staff cost savings that would arise. I have mentioned that. Therefore, our own target conformed with the Minister's target. To answer the Deputy's other question, I am not aware of specific pay cuts having been taken. I am aware, and as we have advised, that there have been significant changes to pension benefits. We have a deficit at the moment. That deficit is impacting on the viability of the schemes and our ability to pay future benefits, and we are engaging with staff representatives. Any changes to pension benefits will impact on any member of the pension scheme on a defined benefit scheme including, for example, myself.Moreover, the proportion of any benefit changes obviously will be different, depending on that person. I cannot advise as to what are the solutions because we are in a process. We are going before the Labour Relations Commission today.

I will focus on three elements, namely, the performing loan book, Priory Hall and Bank of Ireland's branch consolidation or opening of new branches. In a point I also raised yesterday regarding the performing loan book, I note Bank of Ireland's statement that 89% of loans are performing. In a way, that tells a lie because many people in that category are struggling each month to pay their mortgage. As I stated yesterday, they probably are feeding the mortgage before feeding their children. Do the witnesses have to hand analysis as to how anyone in that performing book may dip into arrears or be part of Bank of Ireland's arrears problem in the coming years? In particular, I am thinking about variable interest rates and note Bank of Ireland increased its variable interest rate by 0.5% last year. There is a feeling among mortgage holders that those who are on variable interest rates are being played off against those who are on tracker rates. What are Bank of Ireland's projections over perhaps five years, as to how it will protect those people or ensure those who are "performing" do not dip into arrears? While the bank may consider them to be performing, many of them are struggling.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	264	Sorry, that was two questions. Did the Deputy have a third one?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	266	Okay. It is impossible for us to forecast in the future. However, as I mentioned, as part of our assessment of our capital requirements we look at each of our portfolios under the range of interest rate scenarios we see, under unemployment scenarios we see and income scenarios we see. That is the consensus and then we look at the stress scenarios. The stress scenarios obviously are significantly worse. One of the particular stress scenarios at which we look is continued recession in Ireland and euro interest rates increasing. That obviously is a stress scenario. What we look at are the customers who are going into default and so, as we mentioned, in the current environment, reflecting work we are doing, a general, gradual and bumpy improvement in the economy and, in particular, the increasing number of people in employment, our early arrears are falling. Should interest rates spike to whatever level, then the number of customers who will move into arrears inevitably will increase. Should the economy not perform in accordance with expectations, the arrears will increase. It is impossible to give an exact figure but we have looked at our capital on both of those scenarios. With regard to Priory Hall, is there something that Mr. Stephen Mason-----

However, on the variable interest rate, yesterday AIB stated it did not envisage any increase in the next 12 months. Can Bank of Ireland also give that assurance?

I made the point yesterday that while this is not saying much, its residents state that AIB is the better of the banks with which to deal. AIB spoke about positive solutions, new homes and dealing with each individual resident on its books in the next number of weeks. What is Bank of Ireland's position in respect of Priory Hall?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	272	I believe we have eight owner-occupier accounts relating to Priory Hall property. First, those customers are not part of the normal resolution process and we recognise the particular circumstances. In this regard, while we are obliged under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, to send specific letters to those customers, they are not in a resolution or restructuring process. I think six or seven of the eight have advised us that they want a third party to represent them and that process is ongoing.

As everyone knows, we do not necessarily need to be ringing the customers to find out what is happening with Priory Hall. It is something we all follow closely. The last thing we wish to be doing is getting on to these customers, who find themselves in this unfortunate position, too often. As Mr. Boucher stated, they are not part of our standard collections process. However, we stay in touch with them and have been in touch with them in recent weeks.

However, if I may finish the question, I am not getting any sense from Mr. Boucher that Bank of Ireland has any solution, positive or negative, in mind. Mr. Boucher is just talking about a process and while everyone knows there is a process, I wish to ascertain what Bank of Ireland considers to be a reasonable outcome for these families who obviously are under considerable stress, considering that the bank still is accumulating interest on the loans they have with it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	284	We have stated they have expressed their desire to have a third party representative and that engagement is coming in place.

I cannot pick on one particular solution. We are open to a range of solutions, depending on the individual circumstances of the customers. As for the particular aspects of the Priory Hall situation, I do not know what AIB offered or stated yesterday.

This era in our history will be spoken of for ten, 20, 30,100 or 200 years to come. I refer to the former site of the Irish Parliament at College Green, which is currently in the bank's hands. Given recent events within Bank of Ireland, do the witnesses not think it would be a reasonable suggestion for the bank to do what the Government has suggested should be done and as a gesture to the Irish people, give that site back to them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	292	We are not aware of any such request from the Government. However, I should also point out that as we have disclosed, the investment the State has made in Bank of Ireland is €4.8 billion. We repay investment in our businesses in support for the economy in hard cash of €3.9 billion. As for the taxpayer, we are very grateful for that support and throughout my four years, my colleagues have constantly heard me stating we must reduce the risk to the taxpayer and must reward and repay in cash. That is the most tangible way we can do that. That is the most tangible demonstration. If we look at our particular assets and the need for those assets to contribute to the bank in the future, as well as our ability to continue to reward and repay the taxpayer, to use the specific example, we need those assets. Our College Green branch is our largest branch in the country.It is a key branch, in particular, for Trinity College. It is our most profitable branch. It is also a cash centre. Therefore, it is a commercial asset. We are a privately-owned company which is repaying the taxpayer.

Mr. Boucher's gratitude is nice, but pretty meaningless. In terms of a physical transfer of an iconic building, would that be a lasting gesture on the bank's behalf to the Irish people that would be seen as something that would be welcome, and one could look to the future with confidence?

For those Priory Hall residents, although there are only eight, I am getting very little positivity.

We have done a significant amount of television advertising asking customers to do that. We have put it on bank statements when we send them out to customers. Forbearance is not just for customers who are in arrears. We are asking customers to talk to us before they come into arrears if they have significant financial difficulties, and if it is appropriate, we will restructure their mortgages.

I want to recognise the ongoing increase in the performance of Bank of Ireland across a range of metrics. That is to be recognised. For me and members of the committee, as public representatives, the concern is that some of that performance is coming at the cost of customers who were unfortunate to borrow too much money from Bank of Ireland during the bubble. The arrears targets is really what this is about. My concern is that the significant arrears at Bank of Ireland and various other lenders is the symptom. It is not the problem. The problem is there is a significant number of households - be they in arrears or, as was mentioned earlier, struggling to stay out of arrears - who owe too much money relative to their income. I do not believe that offering customers these types of solutions will solve the problem. I believe that reducing their debt levels relative to their household income will solve the problem. I will go through the figures Mr. Boucher presented to the committee. Of the 12,700 restructures in place, approximately 3,600, or 30%, are interest only. Would Mr. Boucher accept that moving customers to interest only ultimately increases the total amount paid by a borrower to the bank?

I merely want to know if Mr. Boucher agrees that putting someone on interest only for a period and then moving him or her back where he or she can pay out the capital and interest over time, increases the total payments to the bank over the period of that mortgage.

I am going to move on. There is another 20% which are on reduced payment. Obviously, these are temporary as well. In this case, the amount of capital being paid - let us say, over an 18-month period - is reduced and the full interest is paid. Would Mr. Boucher agree that, in this case as well, the total amount paid by a household to the bank over the term of the full mortgage will be higher than the original mortgage envisaged?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	325	Yes.

With term extension, the customers pay capital and interest, but they pay the capital over a longer period of time. These account for 30% of the restructures - we are now up to 80% of all restructures. Would Mr. Boucher agree that term extensions also increase the total amount that a household will pay relative to what was expected when the mortgage was taken out?

There is another 10% - this is now 90% of all restructures - which involve recapitalisation of arrears. Would Mr. Boucher agree that when that is fully paid down, the total amount paid by the household to the bank is higher than the total amount envisaged when the mortgage was taken out.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	331	As I mentioned earlier,-----

At least 90% of restructures increase the total payments from the household to the bank. In terms of sustainability and addressing the fact that households have too much debt and too many payments, at least 90% of Bank of Ireland's restructures increase the level of indebtedness of these households. For the 10% who are left, we do not have the full breakdown. On the split mortgage, is the interest charged on the shelved portion a market interest the same as the interest paid on the non-shelved portion?

The bank is taking a mortgage and splitting it in half. Mr. Boucher is saying the customer is paying the full interest at market rate on the full capital amount as to Deputy Michael McGrath's question and there is no reduction in the amount being paid there either. Does the bank engage in voluntary surrenders?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	337	There is a cash-flow reduction.

AIB also charges 0% on the split, which makes it something that lowers the total amount to the bank. Here is my problem. Mr. Boucher stated earlier that Bank of Ireland made many mistakes and these restructured mortgages are those mistakes. We are seeing them and, obviously, there is much more. However, it turns out that in at least 90% of cases - I will bet Mr. Boucher it is 99% - the bank will profit from those mistakes because all of these households will not only repay the bank all of these loans, much of which, Mr. Boucher stated, were mistakes - obviously, the borrower made a mistake in borrowing it but, by God, the bank made a mistake in some of the lending-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	345	I beg Deputy Donnelly's pardon. I have actually just said that the forbearance costs the bank money. It costs the bank money because we have to borrow the money. If we are not getting amortisation in accordance with our expectations, we have to borrow the money in the market or pay a deposit. Therefore, it does cost us money. Every forbearance costs us money. That is why it is disclosed in our accounts. It is an important issue for investors.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	346	In some cases it may cost the bank more money but in other cases it would cost you less money, for example, on interest only. If the interest the bank is getting from the borrower is less than the amount that the bank can borrow, for example, from the ECB, that interest-only loan is not costing the bank money and the bank is profiting from it. The total profit, the total net present value of those mortgages to the bank, increases.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	347	If I could answer that question, to be helpful I said that the vast majority of our arrears customers are on a tracker.I said that the average all-in cost of a tracker basis 155 points. In our accounts at the end of June, we said that the total cost of money to the bank was 161 basis points, so they are costing us money. Tracker mortgages cost us money.

The solutions offered by Bank of Ireland in at least 90% of the cases, and I bet there are more, actually increase the total amount those households will end up paying the bank. If I was in Mr. Boucher's position or was a shareholder in the bank, I would think that is fine. I accept that this is the sensible thing to do for Bank of Ireland. However, for us as public representatives, allowing Bank of Ireland to increase the total amount that these households pay it is wrong. I know I am running out of time-----

If that matches, then we have a sustainable solution, but we do not just do it on the basis of conversations. We do it on a rigorous assessment of the customer's income and outgoings and then match them to what we can offer.

I agree with him as opposed to Deputy Ó Ríordáin that we do not really need gestures. We need real action from the bank not just in terms of hard cash, although that is one side of it. The major issue is whether we can get the tens or hundreds of thousands of people in the country as a whole and the tens of thousands with whom Bank of Ireland is dealing who are in dire distress and unable or barely able to pay their mortgages out of this hole and what Bank of Ireland is doing to help them out of a hole it helped dig for them. What I do not get from Bank of Ireland in particular or any of the banks is any sense that it has a responsibility to take a hit for what it did to put those people into a hole. What Mr. Boucher is really describing is that Bank of Ireland is seeking to squeeze every single cent it can out of every single one of its mortgage account holders. The bank will chase them for every last cent, even if they are forced to give the house back to it in a so-called voluntary surrender. The bank will hound them for every cent regardless of whether they do a so-called restructure or hand back their home. Is there any talk of write-down, which is what the bank should be doing to acknowledge its role in creating this mess in the first place?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	360	Debt forgiveness is not a policy of the bank. We have a responsibility to a wide range of stakeholders. Nine out of ten of our owner-occupiers often struggle to meet their mortgages, so we must have faith and they must have faith in us that they will be treated fairly. We work extremely hard on restructuring mortgages where we can and in particular dealing with customers' cashflow issues. We believe the solutions we offer to customers are solutions that keep them in their family homes wherever possible. That costs the bank money. Sometimes we can look at these things in one particular way. My job is to look at the wider spectrum and how each thing influences it. The bank must be profitable. If it is not profitable, we cannot lend the money into the economy that it needs. That is a commercial and strategic objective and a fact of life. If the €3.9 billion in cash that has come from Bank of Ireland was not provided, tax rates would need to be higher and services or State investment would need to be lower. The money must come from somewhere. It is a zero sum game. A restructure or forgiveness to someone costs someone else money and it comes to the heart of the bank's capital, objectives and repayment to the taxpayer.

In other words, the developers who were most guilty of getting us into this mess were getting write-offs while for the most part, ordinary home owners were not getting any forgiveness. What is the comparable situation in Bank of Ireland? Is it giving debt write-down or forgiveness to the developers on its books?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	362	No. We looked to maximise the recoveries, so in answer to a question from Deputy Harris - my apologies if it is the wrong Deputy - I set out the accounting write-offs. The accounting write-off occurs after we have realised our collateral and maximised all other forms of recovery. Very often, that involves insolvency. In some instances with corporates, we will do a debt for equity swap. We do not write that off but we provide upfront for that.

Many of the banks seem to be just playing for time in situations that are further digging people into a hole and possibly hoping the economy will bounce back or the property situation will improve. Does Mr. Boucher not think that it is also extremely damaging for the economy? Under what he and all the banks are describing, there might be up to 200,000 families who will be pinned to the wall for 20 or 30 years.

Even if, as he says, it cannot afford a full write-down of all the negative equity and arrears, does he not think it must talk about some level of write-down where it acknowledges its responsibility and gets people out of this hole both for their sake, for the sake of the economy and for the sake of fairness?

The fact is that if Bank of Ireland is not profitable, it cannot lend into the economy and give a return and repayments to the taxpayer. Those are the broad parameters. Should we spend the time concentrating on a single issue without looking at the consequences broadly across the responsibilities that I, my colleagues and our board have to consider all our stakeholders, including private sector shareholders who provided capital and the customers who are meeting their repayments, often in difficult circumstances, and to work with challenged customers? I do not and cannot agree with the Deputy that our restructures are not working.They are sustainable restructures which take into consideration the cashflow characteristics of the customers, and we want to resolve those with customers. In July, we provided a solution to 80% customers who had engaged with us and provided an SFS, standard financial statement. It may not be the solution some people might like, but to us and to that customer, who has taken third party advice, that is a sustainable solution and, in particular, that customer stays in the family home.

Moving towards a repossession is, from our perspective, a fail. We need the customer to engage. Where the customer is engaged, we can help, as I mentioned, in 80% of cases. If the customer does not engage, for whatever unknown reason, the customer is narrowing down the options. A repossession is a cost to the bank which we always seek to avoid, but we lend against collateral and we must, if necessary in extreme cases, be able to realise our collateral. We monitor the performance of our front-line staff on an ongoing basis through the recording of their conversations. It is a very important part of the process that we are professional and empathetic with the customer. We get advice from independent third parties, for example UK Asset Resolution, UKAR, the UK Government-owned agency that deals with the mortgage banks it took over, such as Bradford & Bingley. They examine the standards we operate. The Central Bank sends in third parties or its own staff to sit beside our colleagues who are dealing with very difficult situations, and they monitor their performances. We have checks and balances to ensure that happens.

Would he comment on the fact that Bank of Ireland is advising its customers not to pay their credit union loans? That has come back to me strongly. Does he not feel that an holistic approach to debt management produces better results in the long term rather than one financial institution advising its customers not to pay another?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	373	Our priority has been the family home. In the first instance Bank of Ireland led, with the other banks, a protocol of significant restructuring and repayment of unsecured loans from one bank to another, for example, if a person has an unsecured loan or a credit card with Bank of Ireland and a mortgage with AIB. An holistic approach is absolutely what we seek. We cannot restructure in a situation where other creditors are making no gesture towards the customer and everyone. We are strong advocates of an holistic approach to dealing with debt. The customers' cashflows are what they are and cannot be adjusted or manoeuvred. The question is how those cashflows are used towards repayment. Even though strictly speaking, under normal credit criteria in a normal situation, unsecured creditors take all the hit, Bank of Ireland has advocated a protocol which ensures as much clarity as possible for customers and debt service agencies, etc. as to what is tolerable. I cannot say we will restructure a mortgage where there is no gesture on the part of another unsecured creditor, and it would be inappropriate for me to do so. At the same time, I do not expect an unsecured creditor, on a voluntary basis, to get nothing, so there is a compromise but it must reflect the family home, the priorities and the usage of the customers' cashflows.

I have heard that back on a number of occasions and it is concerning.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	375	We have said we cannot offer this restructure if the cashflow coming from our restructure is going, without any gesture on the other side, to meet those repayments. That is commercially nonsensical.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	377	It depends on the contract of the mortgage. As I mentioned, the vast bulk of our default customers are on tracker mortgages and the average all-in rate of our trackers is 1.55%.

We are here to talk about the arrears and the targets the Government set when the Minister for Finance announced this strategy on 13 March. Clearly, the strategy has failed. It is arguable that Bank of Ireland, in the little it has done, has gone beyond what the Government set out for it. It is time we, as the Legislature, took control of this and brought in legislation instead of just having the banks in here every so often, asking questions and then away with them, again and again. Let us not forget the banks that come before us and which are subject to the rules we are discussing today represent only approximately three quarters of the mortgage market. This is of no relevance to one quarter of the mortgage-holding public. They might as well switch off the television as the Oireachtas is doing nothing for them. It is time we took a grip of this situation. When it was launched, the Government's scheme was widely welcomed by Government Deputies and criticised by the Opposition. We received criticism for criticising it but we have been proved right. The whole thing has been a failure. I hope this committee does not stop at these interviews as if we have done our job. We must take control of this, legislate for this situation and force the banks, through legislation, to put solutions in place. If effort is needed at international or European level to change capital rules to bring in debt-for-equity schemes, that has to happen and the Government should prioritise that. Bank of Ireland did a nasty thing in the UK this year when it took tracker rates away from borrowers. It was a mean thing to do because people expected their tracker rates would last forever. Has Bank of Ireland examined this in Ireland and has it any plans to do that here? Can Mr. Boucher give me a categorical assurance it will not tamper with the tracker rates of borrowers in Ireland?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	381	Because that reflected the contractual requirements. We went through a complete process of engagement with the Financial Services Authority, FSA, which is the UK equivalent of the Central Bank and regulatory authorities, both from a prudential and a customer side. The regulatory authorities recognised the pattern we had and allowed us to proceed.That was a particular part of our mortgage book in the UK. They were not trackers. Some people may have described them as trackers; they were not trackers and could not have been trackers because we could not have done what we did after engagement with the FSA.

I have one minute left. I am with Deputy Donnelly on this because I am from that generation. From my dealings with people, as a former banker and now a politician, I am acutely aware that ultimately those of us who enter into an arrangement will be paying more for that house than we envisaged initially. I am of the opinion - Mr. Boucher will have heard me say this on numerous occasions - that there should be a moratorium on profit making for institutions such as Bank of Ireland. I believe there needs to be an investigation into whether the previous directors or some of the existing directors were negligent in their behaviour. My final question is as follows. Has Bank of Ireland held an internal investigation into whether the directors conducted themselves in a negligent manner?

The negative equity component of that is €3.9 billion. Of the impaired loans - that is 90 days past due and-or impaired - €1 billion is considered impaired negative equity and 90 days beyond it is due but not considered impaired is €200 million.

In response to my colleague Mr. Boucher said categorically the Bank of Ireland did not do what he called debt forgiveness. Does that mean that Bank of Ireland has not, in respect of any owner-occupier mortgage, reduced the amount of capital borrowed during the bubble?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	472	I cannot say categorically that it has not, but it is not a policy of the bank. I cannot say categorically that it has never been done during the past three or four years.

Mr. Boucher was central to the banks conniving with bondholders, developers and right-wing politicians during the property bubble in legal extortion of a generation of young working people in terms of holding them over a barrel for the human right of having a home over their heads. Following the collapse of the bubble and the crash in the economy, many of them are now on a thread mill of endless suffering and grief. Bank of Ireland now has 12,700 people subject to forbearance and 103,000 fully performing mortgages, with many at the pin of their collar to make repayments. Included in that 103,000 figure are many people who were forced to borrow exorbitant amounts to purchase a modest home. I again put it to Mr. Boucher that it is high time that not only Bank of Ireland but also banks in general, the Government, the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank realised that soaking the amount of money they do from hard pressed people is not only causing them huge suffering but is also damaging the economy which Mr. Boucher says he is pledged to assist. Is it not time that all of those mentioned got together and provided for a blanket write-down according to the current value of people's homes and, thus, a write-down calibrated on the monthly repayments? Is that not the solution to this nightmare?

We heard yesterday from representatives of Allied Irish Banks, are hearing today from representatives of Bank of Ireland and will hear tomorrow from other bank representatives, all of whom adhere to definitions as per guidelines from the Central Bank in tabulating statistics and targets.

We provide significant information in our financial statements. In the case of Bank of Ireland, when we provide information on our accounts, we clearly set out the definitions. It is hard to know how one would define a strategic default. If we were requested to provide information based on certain criteria-assumptions, we would be happy to provide it.

Mr. Boucher has mentioned that some of the people who have not contacted the bank are strategic defaulters and that others cannot pay.

Of the current mortgages in default, how many fall into the category of persons who have contacted and engaged with the bank and are now deemed by it to be unable to pay? Earlier Mr. Boucher said 1,097 mortgages were unsustainable, 937 were in default and 10% of loans in arrears were in what he termed potentially a different category. Can he say how many Bank of Ireland mortgages are unsustainable and what will happen to the holders of these mortgages?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	497	We cannot say because we do not know until we engage.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	499	In terms of the assessments, I was trying to be helpful by giving the figures for the year to date and the July figures which are the most up-to-date figures available to me and my colleagues. Obviously, we look at this on an ongoing basis, but in a format that I can discuss with the committee, Bank of Ireland was able to offer restructuring of debt to 80% of the customers who had had an SFS assessed by it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	505	In those instances we do not know whether the customer is co-operating fully. Where an SFS form has been completed and we are unable to form an opinion or believe the customer can afford to contract a payment, we will take another look. In other cases there is a wide range of issues involved, including that there has not been full disclosure on the SFS and so on. It is impossible for me to judge. We have tried to be helpful to the committee in setting out where we are in the legal process. Again, I gave statistics for the legal process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	507	In the first instance, Bank of Ireland looks at the long term. We want our customers to remain with us because they want to do so, not because they do not have a choice. Customers will always have a choice and competitors can emerge at any stage. Bank of Ireland has been around for 220 years and expects to be around for at least another 200. To do this, we must provide competitive options for customers that are commercially sensible.We have seen banks come and go in this country whose business models were not sustainable, and the customers have been left stranded. Our products must be competitive and commercially sensible and sustainable in order for us to continue to provide them, and to continue having investment. As every business person does, we must have a long-term objective. Ours is to ensure that we have more customers with Bank of Ireland at the end of this year than we had at the start of this year. That can only happen by providing products and services that our customers want and need.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	508	I welcome our guests and wish them good luck in restoring commercial viability to at least one part of the Irish banking system. I will ask again for the breakdown of the 3,103 customers and the 3,164 customers with regard to defaults. There are four people from Bank of Ireland before the committee, with four in the Gallery, and it is not acceptable that we have been asking for three hours for those numbers to be broken down. It reminds me of a Which? survey in the UK that found Bank of Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of customer service. I would hate to be waiting at a counter for the kind of responses we are seeking. The numbers should be supplied. What does the bank think are correct loan-to-value ratios and loan-to-earnings ratios? The committee is trying to restore solvency in Irish banking and the prudent ratios were exceeded in the past. That is why we are here. In pages 11 and 12 of the documentation provided, there are details of an extra €300 million in defaulted owner-occupancy loans, with the rate of default increasing during this year. Some €100 million was added in the second half of last year and €200 million was added in the first half of this year. There is also €300 million defaulted in buy-to-lets. Mr. Boucher mentioned that people with multiple buy-to-let properties are his big problem. That is also true in the Houses, as many Deputies and Senators have found that the receivers of these properties tend to evict tenants. Yesterday, we asked AIB for an assurance that such practices would not happen. We will have to get used to much rented accommodation because of a collapse in the mortgage market, and for people, rented properties will be principal private residences. They may be paying rent to a bankrupt landlord. Threshold and the likes of Senator Aideen Hayden have drawn attention to that serious problem, so I would like a clear statement from the bank on the policy in that regard. The Family Home Protection Act should be extended to people who pay rent and live in buy-to-let properties. The landlord should be pursued but the conduct of the receivers should be considered by banks. There has been some concern in rural areas that fairly nasty characters have turned up on behalf of banks to engage in repossessions. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, recently told the Seanad that banks had intervened to try to reduce the rate of interest paid by the post office on savings. Is Bank of Ireland part of that? It would be regrettable if that happened. The Minister indicated he opposed the measure at Cabinet but the request came from the banks. Did this bank play a role? With regard to the Mercer report, figures in the presentation indicate that staff costs are down by 9.5%, with other figures indicating that staff numbers went down by 10.6%. Those who remained must have seen a pay increase. It seems there has been a decision not to implement the findings of the Mercer report.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	511	The staff numbers are from a point in time and the reductions are over a period. I do not believe the Senator's conclusion or assertion is correct, although I can understand how the Senator has made it while considering two different sets of figures. With regard to rent receivers, tenants may be paying rent that is diverted. There is a requirement to professionalise the way the matter is dealt with by the rent receiver, which has obligations to abide by contracts. The tenant would have a lease agreement that I presume would be registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board. The receiver would have a commercial interest in seeing that done, as the receiver wants to see income flowing. We appoint a receiver when we have evidence that income is being diverted. The apartment or house may be occupied, with the tenant paying rent, but we are not getting it. The tenant's occupancy would be endangered if that happens. A rent receiver must respect obligations and ensure, for example, that if management charges are payable, they are paid. There is professionalisation and regularisation of the process. The Senator mentioned a Which? survey but I should note that the survey was of products we do not have. We do not provide a current account in Britain, although we provide them in Northern Ireland. A MORI survey of current accounts provided in Northern Ireland indicated customer satisfaction levels to be very high. We need to appreciate what is being surveyed. Our current account is offered only in Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. We run the operation in Northern Ireland as an island of Ireland business but from a regulatory perspective, it must be part of the UK division. We review the competitive environment and if state aid is being utilised to distort competition, we object to it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	517	I cannot comment. We are the only bank within the EU restructuring plan. The State invested €4.8 billion in Bank of Ireland, with €3.9 billion in cash coming back. The State and taxpayers would then profit from Bank of Ireland.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	519	I must get straight to it as time is against me. An overall calamity has hit Ireland, and it is a shameful episode of ten years, with four years after 2008 and six years leading up to that time. The banking sector - not just here but abroad and everywhere - has acted disgracefully, crushing and distressing households and indigenous businesses. I can explain mathematically how this was done. Unfortunately, the media does not seem to understand the following. Loan-to-deposit ratios are the centripetal prudential force of a bank's balance sheet and if bank boards waver from that idea, they endanger deposits and lead to a financial collapse. Yesterday, the chief executive of AIB, Mr. David Duffy, reminded everybody here that a mortgage is a loan secured on an asset. If the banking sector for six years abandons in a cumulative fashion the prudential principles of keeping loans to deposits at 90% and a fractional reserve of 10%, they create the credit asset bubble. How dare a banking sector think it is entitled to collect all the loan secured on the asset which it consistently helped to pump up for six years. That would be wrong, and that is why Deputy Higgins is correct. As Deputy Donnelly mentioned, it is wrong for loans to be manufactured and recalculated over a longer period.There should be a concerted effort by the two big banks. They are zombie banks. The households are crushed but the bank is still a zombie, and I will show how. Go to page 10 of the loans and provisions. There is nothing personal in this; I am just superbly frustrated for the last five years by the denials of the truth of the situation. Bank of Ireland has a loan book of €95 billion in four categories, three main categories and a little one called "consumer". The bank has provisions of €8.1 billion on €95 billion. That is 8.5%. The sister bank with a loan book of €88.9 billion has €17 billion of provisions, or 18.5%. It is the same size as Bank of Ireland's loan book and is probably not unalike in geographical dispersion. It is in the same economy with roughly the same number of employees. Yet Bank of Ireland is saying it is 2.2 times better than AIB in terms of what is collectable. If one reruns the provisioning, and I suggest the bank do that, at 15% provisioning on the €52.2 billion for residential mortgages, at 10% on the €22.5 billion of non-property SMEs and a modest 25% on the property and construction loans, one arrives at a figure of €14.68 billion of required provisions, but the bank only has €8.1 billion. That indicates the bank needs between €6.5 billion and €7 billion more capital. That is why groups such as Fitch and Moody's say the banks are under-capitalised. If the banks did have the right capital, they would get on with the job of recalibrating households and businesses to what their maintainable, reasonable incomes will be able to service. That is what is required. Deputy Higgins was right when he told Mr. Barroso that it is wrong to have €70 billion of private sector losses by speculators, which is technically the right word to use, in an economy. They are the people who put money in. In March 2009, Bank of Ireland had €45 billion in senior secured debt on its balance sheet. That was down from €61 billion in March 2008. The huge number of speculator, high yielding bond guys got out. They did that with the help of Central Bank of Ireland advances as well as ECB advances.

A national concerted effort is needed to get the country out of the hole and to drain the swamp so normal economic activity can start again. Yes, it is approximately €60 billion for the euro system. As regards the promissory note of €27 billion that was recently refinanced by a series of 40 year bonds, that was a sham. There was no negotiation. That had to happen. There was no chance that Ireland ever could have borne an 11 year profile of €28 billion. It was not even a question of asking for it; we were given it.

For example, he talked about Bank of Ireland's mortgage book and said it is similar to that of AIB. That is not factually the case. Of our €52 billion in mortgages, €27 billion are in the Republic of Ireland and €25 billion are in the UK. One would have to accept there is a different profile. If we look to our Irish books, on the basis of the information provided by AIB and the information provided by us and as independently assessed and verified, we see that of AIB's €38.8 billion owner-occupier loans, the defaulted loans are 22.7%. It is 14% for Bank of Ireland. There is a different profile. One cannot compare that. I do not agree with the Deputy's assertion.

What was the profile of the people to whom the letters were sent? AIB's representatives said yesterday that the letters were sent to people who had not made any repayments for three years. The witness went through the breakdown of the 3,103 very quickly. Can the witness outline the profile of the 1,500 and give the breakdown? I know it was not of the 3,103 but of an up-to-date figure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	533	Mr. Boucher gave an example of several hundred that are at civil bill level. Some are at unexecuted possession order stage in that. I do not have a breakdown. In our case it is highly unlikely that there were three years without repayments before we got to this stage. I would have thought that they would be beyond the demand stage and they would be somewhere deeper in the legal process, unless they were held up by the Dunne judgment which meant we could not have progressed them in the legal process. I have not looked at it in that way. We just make sure that we are compliant with CCMA and that we have given the customer every opportunity before we instigate the legal process. Even when we do so, we would still be hopeful that the customer will engage with us and give us the information required to make a restructure of their mortgage.

If a customer has not engaged and continues to not engage in accordance with the CCMA process, the first step for us is that we write to the customer and say: "Would you please engage with us. If you do not engage with us, we will have to go with the legal process."

Is that a fair comment? If I conducted a pro rata exercise based on what the witnesses have said, the full interest would be approximately 40% and the reduced payment would be greater than 50%.

We have over 100 unexecuted possession orders. The main reason we do not execute the possession order is that the customer is back engaging and making appropriate payments.

AIB appeared before us yesterday and referred to the number of customers in default for 90 days or more. To clarify, 90 refers to 90 days in arrears rather than 90 calendar days. It is the sum of 90 days. Someone might accrue 90 days of arrears over 18 months.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	556	It is the missing of three payments.

Yesterday afternoon, AIB stated that a percentage of those over 90 days in arrears who have provided SFSs show they have sums on account that may be equal or greater to the arrears outstanding. They might have €15,000 or €20,000 on deposit. The point was raised by Mr. Duffy. Is there a similar situation according to investigations by Bank of Ireland?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	558	We do not have that level of detail or information. Coming back to the assessment of the SFSs, while we can get caught up in tiny figures, directionally out of SFS assessments for owner-occupier customers that we did in the month of July, in roughly 10% of them we felt the customer could pay. Let us not take the month of July in isolation because this can change. The year to date figure is broadly similar.

Mr. Boucher is saying this is not leaping off the page or setting off red lights.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	560	I cannot say that. All I can talk about is the amount we can restructure.

I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. Farrell, Mr. Mason and Mr. Prizeman for coming before the committee. The target figures are a process we will see over the coming 12 months. The 50% figure will be reached by year's end and the committee will wish to engage with the banks at that stage to see how the 50% figure is being reached. There seems to be an issue with getting the precise figures of the 20% resolution and the modelling going on. I hope we have resolved that and I hope Bank of Ireland can furnish us with those figures in terms of modelling. We will meet the Governor of the Central Bank later this month. One of the outcomes that has arisen from meetings so far is the need to sit down and talk with the Governor about the definition of a resolution process. I thank Mr. Boucher and I welcome some of his remarks, particularly the noticeable increase in lending to SMEs, which is separate to those that are restructuring. That is a positive development and a topic on which the bank has engaged with us in the past. I propose suspending until 2.30 p.m. when we will resume proceedings with Ulster Bank. Is that agreed? Agreed.

The next module involves representatives of Ulster Bank. I welcome Mr. Jim Brown, who is the chief executive of the bank. Mr. Brown is accompanied by Mr. Stephen Bell, who is the chief risk officer of the Ulster Bank Group, and Mr. Tom Leahy, who is the southern regional director of Ulster Bank's corporate banking division. Mr. Brown will make some opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session. I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off. I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Before I ask Mr. Brown to make his opening statement, I remind the witnesses that the main focus of today's meeting is on the general performance of Ulster Bank and the other banks. In addition, we are focusing on how the target figure of 20% by the end of June was arrived at. We are also keen to get a statistical breakdown of how many people are now in a resolution process. What is the menu of resolutions being applied in such cases? I invite Mr. Brown to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	563	I thank members of the committee for the opportunity to provide an update on Ulster Bank's progress and its strategy in the areas outlined in the committee's invitation. I will make some brief introductory remarks before responding to any specific issues the committee may wish to address. Ulster Bank is and remains committed to the island of Ireland. It is the third largest financial institution in the Republic of Ireland and the largest in Northern Ireland. It is unique because it is the only systemic bank operating across both markets that is owned by an international parent with a global network. Ulster Bank is an integral part of the financial and social economies in both jurisdictions. We believe a healthy and functioning financial services sector is essential to a vibrant and competitive economy and marketplace. Ulster Bank has a significant presence in Ireland. It currently employs 5,800 people. It has a network of 214 branches and serves almost 2 million customers. It has lending of more than €53 billion in the Irish economy. It holds more than €27 billion in customer deposits. Ulster Bank supports small and medium-sized enterprises with approximately €8.2 billion in loans, with new lending to businesses in the Republic of Ireland amounting to approximately €1.5 billion in 2012. It continues to hold strong market positions across all of its major customer segments, with stable or improving trends in most areas.Ulster Bank, like most financial institutions, has not been immune to the difficulties experienced in the financial services sector. It is an absolute priority that we address the issues we face and return to profitability as soon as possible. Our target is for the bank's core operations to be back to profitability during 2014. We have a clear strategy to achieve this objective and are focused on building a good bank for our customers, while ensuring we deal effectively and responsibly with our legacy issues. Our 2013 interim results which were announced in August are solid and encouraging. They demonstrate consistent progress, compare very favourably with the industry and confirm the effectiveness of our restructuring process and approach. It is worth highlighting some of the key year-on-year figures from these results. Total income increased by 7%; customer deposit balances increased by 12%; our loan-to-deposit ratio improved by 400 basis points; impairment losses decreased by 30%; and our operating loss improved by 41% to €387 million. Separately, we also deleveraged our non-core portfolio by €1.4 billion. This is clear evidence of the progress we are making, which will no doubt be assessed as part of the ongoing review of the RBS Group, including Ulster Bank, by the United Kingdom Government. That said, we are building a business for the future, while managing the issues of the past and making real and evident progress on our strategy to do so.  I will comment specifically on two important areas, as outlined in the joint committee's invitation, namely, mortgage arrears and our support for small and medium-sized businesses. Our objective in dealing with mortgage arrears is very clear. We want to keep as many as possible co-operating customers in their homes. To do this, we need some core fundamentals to be in place. First, customers must be willing to engage with us, as their lender, to ascertain what sustainable arrangement can be put in place for their mortgage arrears. Second, we must be allowed to contact and consult our customers and make arrangements to assist them. The regulatory structure for handling arrears must be sufficiently flexible to take into account each and every customer's position, rather than having a crude one-size-fits-all arrangement. The system for dealing with mortgage arrears must be fair and equitable. It must be fair to homeowners experiencing arrears, lenders and the approximately 80% of homeowners who are servicing their loans. It must always be recognised that secured debt takes priority over unsecured debt. The former is usually priced to reflect the fact that it is supported by a charge on a property. If Ireland is ever to see a recovery in the housing market and attract new lenders to the market, this fundamental building block of the mortgage market must be recognised and supported.  Addressing the mortgage arrears issue is correctly a priority for the Government, the Central Bank and the banking industry. At Ulster Bank we are committed to working with the authorities to achieve this. In doing so, it is accepted that there have been failures on all sides in how mortgage arrears have been handled. As lenders, in addition to having insufficient resources and solutions in the early stages, we have been restricted by delays in giving us the necessary tools to deal with the issue. Matters such as the code of conduct on mortgage arrears contact restrictions, the Dunne ruling and the absence of a centralised credit bureau have exacerbated and extended the problem, as has the continued debate on debt forgiveness. To stress this point, I highlight an interesting trend. In most markets levels of mortgage arrears are directly linked with unemployment. A comparison between our mortgage books in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, a neighbouring market of which we have intimate knowledge, is persuasive. The correlation between unemployment and mortgage arrears continues to hold true in Northern Ireland where there were no such interventions, impediments and discussion of potential mortgage write-offs. In the Republic the correlation between mortgage arrears and unemployment started to break down in the second quarter of 2011 and there is no longer any correlation between them. It appears, therefore, that there has been a breakdown of payment discipline among some mortgage customers. In addition, against this backdrop, sight has been lost of two key fundamentals which are the basis of any mortgage or housing market. First, there is a cost to living in a home and, second, secured debt must be prioritised over unsecured debt. As a result, there continues to be a sizeable minority of customers who have not engaged with us and are refusing to make any payment on their mortgages. Living in a home costs money. Unless owned outright, this cost must be met through mortgage repayments, rent or the provision by the State of social housing. Some people do not appear to accept this premise and are living in a home without making any contribution towards its cost, despite someone else advancing the money to acquire the property. Put simply, this is not fair.  At Ulster Bank we are working with co-operating customers to enable them to resolve their issues. We have committed considerable resources - more than 400 people - to work with and help customers in mortgage arrears. We have a wide range of options to address the particular circumstances of individual customers. We are committed to working with those customers who work with us to find a solution. Our goal is to keep as many co-operating customers as possible in their homes and we believe that in the majority of cases mortgage arrears can be satisfactorily resolved on a case by case basis, given time, good will and co-operation.  Our approach is beginning to show results. I refer members to some of our latest statistics which are available as an attachment to the document circulated. At the end of August 2013 our levels of mortgage arrears for 90 days past due were reducing for the fifth month in a row. This is the first time such a trend has been evident since 2008 and it is contrary to the general trend on mortgage arrears, as reported by the Central Bank. According to our data, ours is the only bank experiencing this improvement. We are completing arrangements for an average of 3,000 customers each month. This is strong progress, which is in the best interests of all of those involved.  With the recent removal of the regulatory restrictions, we have also been able to make contact with 71% of our mortgage arrears customers in the past three months. It is not a coincidence that these industry leading results have followed the changes to the code of conduct introduced in December 2012 which loosened contact restrictions and the enactment of legislation to address the Dunne judgment. However, there remains a danger of another series of unintended consequences arising as a result of excessively prescriptive definitions regarding "sustainability". It is critical that regulatory imposed targets are realistic and sustainability criteria used to assess compliance with such targets are wide enough to take into account individual circumstances, the long-term nature of a mortgage arrangement and the potential for customers' financial circumstances to improve over the life of the mortgage. I welcome the Chairman's comments supporting this view which were reported in the media over the weekend.  As we have consistently advocated to all stakeholders on this matter, we need to be joined up in our thinking and recognise the long-term implications for a sustainable and affordable property and mortgage market. We must also recognise the social policy implications, namely, that people need accommodation and that, in our experience, modified mortgage payments, particularly in the current environment, will almost always be more affordable than the rental cost for the same property in the same location. I reiterate that we are working with co-operating customers and our approach is beginning to show results. On business lending and restructuring, in terms of market presence, Ulster Bank's total core loan book to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, is approximately €8.2 billion. While we cover the market broadly, we are highly focused on agriculture, food, exports, health care and professional services. There are two main areas of focus within our SME core operations, namely, new business lending and supporting SMEs in financial difficulty. New business lending in the Republic of Ireland amounted to €1.5 billion in 2012. We are well positioned, have a strong pipeline of business and look forward to expanding in the SME market, especially as demand increases in an improving economy.  We place considerable importance on SME businesses and provide significant support and financial resources for the sector, including the provision of more than 4,000 start-up packages in 2012 and ongoing investment in information technology to support faster, decentralised decision-making.We would also welcome the opportunity to share with members and the Government our experience from other markets in terms of our support for Government-led initiatives to stimulate and support the sector. Our approach to distressed SMEs is similar to the approach on residential mortgages. We have a wide range of forbearance options which can be brought to bear for individual circumstances. Our primary focus is to support businesses through their difficulties and return them to financial health. We are also keenly aware of the need to safeguard jobs where at all possible. We view formal recovery actions as an option of last resort. In the first half of 2013 alone, we have restructured numerous trading businesses small and large, restructuring which supported business and in turn provided over 7,300 jobs. In conclusion, Ulster Bank has a clear strategy and is making strong progress towards becoming a simpler, more efficient and sustainable bank, while also dealing with our legacy issues. Second, our objective in addressing the mortgage arrears problem is to facilitate co-operating customers and keep them in their homes, while also ensuring a viable property and mortgage market for the future. Our approach is beginning to show results. In dealing with SMEs, we are supporting the sector through new lending and bringing those enterprises that are experiencing financial difficulties back to financial health. Finally, we are proud of our contribution and recognise our responsibilities as a key player in the only systemic full service bank across the island of Ireland providing much-needed competition to the two pillar banks in the market. We have 177 years of history serving customers and communities across the island of Ireland and look forward to continuing to do so in the future. Mr. Stephen Bell, Mr. Tom Leahy and I will be happy to deal with any questions.

First, I would like to establish how many distressed mortgage books the bank has at this time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	565	I refer the Chairman to the table I attached to my opening presentation. Ulster Bank has 122,831 mortgage lines in terms of its total portfolio as of end of July this year. Of that total, we have 18,025 mortgages that are 90 days or more past due.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	566	Therefore, 20% of those 18,025 should have been in a resolution process by the end of June. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	567	It is slightly different. We were asked to set the target for those mortgages that are overdue by 90 plus days at the start of the preceding quarter. We have been able to move some customers out of 90 plus days and have had some success there. The starting number for the quarter 2 qualifying period was 18,922 and 20% of that came to 3,784 to be put on sustainable arrangements.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	568	Can Ulster Bank supply us with a breakdown of the type of resolution applied in those cases, in terms of split mortgages and so on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	569	I will share the broad outline of how we have handled the breakdown of the 18,000 plus customers and will deal with comments following that. Looking at the 18,025 mortgages to which I referred, some 8,868 are in some sort of arrangement. To clarify, 4,038 are in a long-term arrangement -----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	570	To interject, some thousands of customers have been in arrangements. Some arrangements have been interest only arrangements and some have been on mortgage holidays and so on. The 20% figure refers to moving people away from arrangements towards long-term sustainable solutions. What we would like to focus on this afternoon are the figures for people who are in long-term, sustainable solutions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	571	Yes. I will answer the question, but I would like to share how we have approached the issue to get to a solution.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	572	The difficulty is time. I do not know who chairs the Ulster Bank board, but this Chairman is a stickler on time. I will run out of time, so I need Mr. Brown to be concise.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	573	I will be concise. We have 8,868 customers who are in an arrangement, of which 4,000 are in a formal arrangement with us already. Another 500 are in a very short-term arrangement. These may be experiencing short-term difficulties, so we give them a payment holiday for example. Another 4,000 are paying through an informal arrangement that has not been formalised with us yet. Separately, we have just over 3,000 who are not engaging with us at all, but we are attempting to engage with these before we go to the legal process. We then have another 4,900 who are in the legal process and another 1,000 for which we have appointed rent receivers. That is the broad breakdown. Therefore, there are approximately 8,800 in some sort of arrangement, 3,000 that are not engaging, 5,000 in the legal process and 1,000 with rent receivers. I will hand over to Mr. Bell to explain how the 20% was arrived at.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	574	First, has Ulster Bank made the 20% target?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	575	Yes we have.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	576	There seems to be a level of ambiguity as to what puts people into the 20% target figure. Does Ulster Bank include in that 20% people to whom it wrote who have not been in communication with the bank?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	577	No.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	578	In regard to the number of arrangements we declared as at the end of quarter 2, the total was in excess of the 3,784 in terms of those cases where the qualification was through legal proceedings. These were only where the case had been lodged with us, not where we had simply written out to say we might take legal action if something did not happen. We know this is not necessarily a universal definition, but it is the one we felt was most appropriate to the circumstances.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	579	I believe Ulster Bank has a number of people on split mortgages. How many split mortgages does Ulster Bank have?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	580	I would like to share how we address this issue. We have 20 cases that are on a split mortgage - where the loan is separated with two different interest rates. We believe we have a better solution to that, termed an "economic concession", which looks at a reduced interest rate across the entirety of the loan. What this enables the customer to do is to pay more towards a principal reduction during a period of financial distress. As a consequence, we think this is a better outcome for the customer. Perhaps Mr. Bell would like to add a further comment on this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	581	We have a split mortgage available and we have committed that the deferred portion of that split mortgage will bear zero interest. As Mr. Brown said, when we did some comparative analysis, we found the cost of a split mortgage is higher to the customer, because the total cost of credit stays outstanding for longer. We find we can bring the payment down to a lower level, which also allows the customer pay towards capital. Therefore, at an earlier stage in the process the customers become better positioned in terms of loan to value.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	582	Has Ulster Bank tweaked the split mortgage system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	583	We offer both. If a customer said to us he or she felt a split mortgage was the right solution, we would make that available.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	584	We have approximately 1,000 customers on the economic concession.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	585	I want to address the issue of payment breaks. Does Ulster Bank have a structured means of dealing with these when people go into resolution processes? I know the insolvency agency has been in contact with Ulster Bank with regard to this area. If somebody who is in a resolution process and has committed to paying €500 or €1,000 a month has to meet a €3,000 or €4,000 payment, can that person step out of the resolution process? Does Ulster Bank have some sort of guidelines or protocols to deal with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	586	Yes they can.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	587	The terms of the Central Bank's guidance notes provide that an arrangement can be stepped out of for up to 60 days and will still qualify as a sustainable arrangement. Therefore, a provision is built into the mechanics for somebody to do this. What Ulster Bank does is, even where customers are on arrangements -----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	588	The difficulty if they can only step out for two months is that if Mr. A is paying Ulster Bank €500 a month and Mrs. B is paying €1,000 a month and the unforeseen bill is €1,500, Mrs. B can meet that emergency payment, but Mr. A cannot.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	589	Exactly. The point I was going to make is that we have an ongoing dialogue with customers even where they are on arrangements. We felt it was wrong to say the situation is fixed and we can ignore it. Therefore, we have a regular programme of contact with all of our customers, even those on arrangements, to ensure we are fully apprised of any payment circumstances they may have.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	590	There was something else to which Mr. Brown referred several times in his comments, that is, the correlation between employment and arrears. Will he expand on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	591	Certainly. In most markets unemployment is directly correlated to mortgage arrears. The higher the unemployment rate, the higher mortgage arrears tend to become. We have done some analysis in Northern Ireland, which has experienced similar distress to here, and what we have found is that until 2011, that correlation held to about 80%. Since then in Northern Ireland it has continued to be the case. As unemployment has moved up or down - it is generally up at the moment - then mortgage arrears have risen. What has happened here is that unemployment has come down from a peak of 15.1% to 13.7% while in the same period mortgage arrears throughout the market have increased.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	592	I put it to Mr. Brown, based on my experience, that there is a major flaw in the analysis he is making. Approximately 250,000 people who are unemployed at present were not unemployed three or four years ago. They were on good wages at the time, then they lost their jobs and went into arrears and perhaps into a resolution process with Ulster Bank. A number of them have returned to work but they are not returning to work within an ass's roar of what they were earning when they were last employed. Their ability to pay their loans, which they had originally taken out on ratios of between eight and 12 times their income, is still unattainable, although I note we are back now to more modest and prudent lending practices. There is a mindset in the banks in this regard, and I call on the representatives from Ulster Bank to address it this afternoon. Are the loans unsustainable anyway regardless of whether these people return to work, and therefore it does not matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	593	This is why we advocate customers engaging with us if they are in that type of situation to come up with a solution and to work through the issues. The other point to note is that over the same period, as well as unemployment coming down, interest rates on trackers have also fallen. Let us consider rates in 2007, for example. At the time, interest rates were approximately 5% or 5.5%. Interest rates now for a tracker are approximately 1.5%
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	594	In the Ulster Bank mortgage book, what percentage of people are on trackers and how many are on variable rates?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	595	A total of 72% are on trackers. During the same period, as a consequence of the rates coming down, the repayment on the average loan has reduced by 31%. The point I made in my opening remarks was that, in our experience, there has been a strong correlation between unemployment and mortgage arrears. The point we are highlighting is that it seems several factors may have contributed to those arrears continuing to increase while the unemployment rate or repayment rate are coming down.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	596	There was something interesting in the Ulster Bank proposals this afternoon in that they seemed to be implying a range of solutions. They have certainly broadened in recent years. From the get-go there was a limited menu of solutions and many of them simply involved deferment and elongation. More processes have been made available to the bank now. They are indicating that perhaps there needs to be some more or that there needs to be some flexibility around them. Let me broach the issue. Is there a difference between a sustainable solution and what might be considered a sustainable mortgage? As I understand it, the Central Bank has given Ulster Bank targets involving sustainable mortgages whereby they are mortgages that are cleared before someone hits the age of retirement. Perhaps the Central Bank may need to revisit that and allow payments to continue into the post-retirement period, especially in a situation where the capital is rather small. For example, if someone is on a tracker, then an interest-only payment would be far cheaper for that person than renting a house in the private sector following repossession.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	597	Yes. We have shared our views with the Central Bank. I support the Chairman's comment. Let us suppose someone has a relatively small payment to make. For example, if a person is in positive equity and the cost of the mortgage is lower than renting, then my personal view is that is a sustainable solution for the customer. Having said that, it needs to be worked through on a customer-by-customer basis.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	598	Naturally it should be done on a case-by-case basis. Does the definition of sustainable solutions, rather than sustainable mortgages set with the barrier that the loan must be cleared by the time of retirement, give more flexibility to both the banks and customers in distress?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	599	Yes. I mentioned this in my opening remarks. Mr. Bell may wish to comment as well. In my opening remarks I commented that we need to work through and be clear about the definition of "sustainable". In terms of the numbers that we declared for the second quarter results, we took a very conservative definition. When we start considering cases such as the one the Chairman mentioned, careful consideration needs to be given about whether they meet the definition of sustainable.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	600	Is a protocol built into the resolution process? I understand that targets have to be reached and that there will be unexpected and unforeseen criteria and that difficulties will arise. Is there a protocol by which Ulster Bank can communicate to the Central Bank and make the case that it believes these other solutions should come on the table, and, if there is, has the bank made a communication or does it intend to make a communication to the Central Bank at that level?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	601	We have made communications. Perhaps Mr. Bell will comment.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	602	What other solutions is Ulster Bank proposing that are not in place at the moment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	603	I would not say there are additional solutions but the example the Chairman illustrated is exactly right. A home loan is a long-term arrangement that provides accommodation for a family or individual, whatever the case may be. We believe it is not correct to treat short-term or medium-term arrears as if we are trying to collect the money. One of the key factors is that Ulster Bank Ireland Limited is not trying to collect the arrears of anyone. We are simply trying to normalise the repayment on the home loan in order that the customer can get back into a sensible position. One reservation we have had around the sustainability wording is that it sort of requires a degree of foresight about what might happen in the next 25 years which we do not believe is available to us necessarily. This may cause us to take premature action to crystallise a position which we do not believe is right. Therefore, we believe there is a role for solutions to go forward that are not necessarily going to fully discharge the loan. Hence, we believe there is a role for split mortgages within that context.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	604	I will return to this towards the end of the meeting but I have come to my last question. I asked Mr. Duffy the question yesterday afternoon and I asked Mr. Boucher the question this morning. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Duffy made the assertion that there is a certain percentage of people who are more than 90 days in arrears but who have money in significant levels on deposit or on account which would be sufficient to clear their arrears and perhaps even put them into a resolution process. Is Ulster Bank finding the same in its assessments?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	605	Yes, we are. Mr. Bell may wish to share some of the experiences.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	606	I have no wish to generalise from particulars but we have had single payments of in excess of €20,000 paid from customers who were beyond six months in arrears. They said they had the money and paid it over to clear their arrears in full.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	607	The proposition to rebut that could be that people, who perhaps have €25,000 or €30,000 or a sum from redundancy, compensation payment or even an inheritance, are holding that money back because they do not believe that the resolution processes are sustainable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	608	It would not be our experience. There is one thing we welcome, although we have some feedback in general terms. The standard financial statement requires the bank to go through a proper discussion with customers about the sources of income and the nature of their expenditure. Certainly it would not be in our interest to take 100% of a person's savings if it meant that it put him in a difficult position simply to maintain a normal lifestyle. It would not be our experience.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	609	I welcome Mr. Brown, Mr. Bell and Mr. Leahy. I wish to continue along the theme the Chairman started. Mr. Brown outlined that the target in respect of the 20% measure used by the Central Bank was 3,784 and he has given us a breakdown of the 18,000 customers that Ulster Bank currently has in arrears of 90 days or more. How does he regard the bank's performance against that target? Does the figure include those in arrangements plus legal plus rent receiver situations? What has the bank included as being in the performance?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	610	I would like to give the committee an overview of the percentage that we have reached and then perhaps Mr. Bell will give a breakdown of the numbers. In terms of meeting the 20% target, we exceeded that. The percentage that we reached was 32%. That was broken down by a combination of legal cases and rent receiverships as well as permanent solutions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	613	Yes. The total declared number was 6,121, which was made up of 5,172 from PDH cases and 949 from buy-to-let. The latter were largely rent receivership cases. On the PDH, at this stage we saw a bias towards legal being a contributor to hitting the target. It is not what I would like to see on a go-forward basis.

In other words, is that the position as at the end of June?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	615	The requirement is that at the end of each quarter one resets the qualifying 90-day population and then one calculates the percentage off the next figure. From an Ulster Bank point of view and because we are actually moving people out of the 90 plus zone, our target population is coming down and the percentage is increasing. So the numbers are slightly difficult to reconcile. It is not a static pool from 1 March, for example.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	616	So the 5,172 breaks down as-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	617	The 5,172 is made up of 1,048 long-term payment arrangements with customers and 4,124 cases where we took legal action. In the case of buy-to-let, it was entirely driven by rent receiverships appointed where the customer was not handing over the rent received from the tenant to discharge the mortgage. It is a matter of some concern to us that this is the proportion in which the target is to be met. We mentioned at some other forums that we have had some difficulty in engaging with all of our customers until quite recently. Given the need to demonstrate good faith to the Central Bank in hitting the targets, we have taken a fairly cautious approach in only including those things we know it would not disagree with.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	618	One other interesting observation is that of the cases in respect of which we have commenced legal proceedings, 20% of those involved have re-engaged with the bank.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	619	Just so that we are clear in respect of the figures, Mr. Bell indicated that 1,148 of the 5,172 cases in question involved some form of arrangement agreed with customers and that the other 4,124 involved the initiation of legal action in a formal sense.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	620	Those cases have been lodged with solicitors. It is not just simply that a letter saying we are thinking of taking further action is issued.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	622	That is correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	624	Something in excess of 80% of them were for a payment in excess of the original principal interest. There are a number of cases - these were included in the slide attached to Mr. Brown's opening remarks - in respect of which we have agreed a revised payment that is lower than the original monthly payment. We have chosen not to include those in the target for now but we are working through that exercise with our board and we will be coming back to it before the end of the Q3 targets. The majority of those payments are where customers agreed to pay back at least the monthly repayment.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	625	So Mr. Bell is stating that in excess of 80% would involve interest plus some capital. It would, therefore, be something less than the full repayment but more than would be obtained under an interest-only arrangement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	626	It will include, in some cases, what we call "step-up arrangements" where the reason for the arrears has passed and the customer is now able to repay in excess of the monthly payment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	628	There would be some where we have offered to agree to a lower payment because it seems to be more reconcilable with their current financial circumstances. Our view is that recommencing a payment habit - even if it is less than the original monthly payment - is better than simply allowing the situation to drag on in perpetuity. There will be a proportion of cases where we are getting less than the original monthly payment. Our approach to those would be that we then have a regular engagement with the customer, where appropriate and where circumstances permit, to try to then move that payment back to one that is more representative of the original loan.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	629	If we consider that quarter in isolation, it is evident that in the region of 80% and 85% of Ulster Bank's sustainable solutions under the Central Bank's targets programme were accounted for by the appointment of rent receivers or some form of legal action being undertaken.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	630	With one addition, which is that we actually saw a reduction of 548 in cases that were no longer 90 days plus in arrears at the end of the quarter. It is important to reflect the fact that where one has solved the problem, one no longer reports it in the numbers. To some extent, therefore, one does become something of a victim of one's own success in that one takes the numbers out of the denominator as well as the numerator. We have taken 548 cases out of the 90-days-plus category. Of the ones that are in this category, the split the Deputy gave is representative.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	631	I am sure Mr. Bell can see from where I am coming in respect of this matter. I am trying to drill down into the numbers in order to obtain a sense of what Ulster Bank has been doing, particularly under the formal regulatory targets programme. It seems that in the region of five out of every six of the offers under discussion relate to legal action which could, in many cases, result in voluntary or forced repossession of properties. In the buy-to-let category, 100% of cases went to rent receivers. When the concept of sustainable solutions was considered and when a new drive to resolve the mortgage arrears problem took place, people would have understood that some more innovative solutions would have been wheeled out in great numbers and that resolutions would be achieved. I would be shocked if the Central Bank were satisfied with the extremely high levels of legal proceedings in the owner-occupier category and rent receiverships in the buy-to-let category.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	632	It is worth highlighting that, as I said earlier, we are not seeking to repossess homes. That is not our intention. We want to keep people in their homes. We have initiated legal action in cases where customers have not engaged with us, despite our writing to them, calling them, etc., on numerous occasions. These are generally cases that are nine to 12 months in arrears. What we believe will happen is that through initiating the legal action, there will be a percentage of customers who will re-engage with us. That is already happening and 20% have re-engaged with us. We expect that figure to rise over time. In other markets, that is likely to reach something of the order of 70% based on our experience. The key thing is that what we are looking for is for those people who are not engaging to talk to us. At present, the only tool we have available to us in this regard is the legal process because they are not communicating with us in any other way.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	633	In the context of the targets, under this measurement Ulster Bank has already achieved the end of September target. Earlier, Bank of Ireland gave a figure of 53% and indicated that it has achieved its end-of-year target in the context of resolution. There is a serious mismatch between what people understood to be sustainable solutions and the actual measures being rolled out by the banks. I do not really expect our guests to respond to that, I am merely making a general observation on the roll-out of the programme. I wish to move on. Ulster Bank is not using the term "strategic default". Our guests referred instead to a breakdown in payment discipline and to a sizeable minority of customers not engaging. They also indicated that when the bank obtained the additional powers under the code, it managed to contact 71% of those in arrears during the past three months. They are holding this figure up as being high. The problem of people not engaging seems, according to our guests, to be very serious. In addition, the bank seems to be using a different term in respect of those who are strategically defaulting.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	634	Since the amendments to the code of conduct in December of last year, we have been able to increase our contact with customers. As a result of that, the number of customers who were not engaging has fallen significantly. In fact, that number has halved since late last year. As highlighted by Mr. Bell, the key from our perspective is to be able to contact customers in the first instance. We have now reached 71% of those customers. Another thing we want to do is get them back into some sort of repayment habit. In other words, get them back into the habit of paying and then we can work through solutions with them. That has been our approach to addressing the mortgage arrears issue. As a consequence of that, we are starting to see our overall arrears come down. That has been the case for the past five months.

Are such reductions temporary?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	636	It is a long-term reduction. It would typically last for five to seven years. It could even be for the lifetime of the loan. It would depend on the customer's circumstances.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	638	We did not include any of them this time around. As stated, there had been a lot of contention and a lack of definition around the different targets. We wanted to declare only those things that we were absolutely clear were not going to be contentious. If we are having a review of the Ulster Bank Ireland board shortly and if we are going to consider some of the other definitions of what is sustainable - which would be more in accordance with the examples the Chairman provided - then I suspect that number will rise considerably as the year progresses.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	640	We have had some exchanges where we have agreed to disagree. We think it would be an unfortunate state of affairs if the customer was happy with the payment, the lender was happy with the payment, the court was happy with the payment and the only person who was unhappy with it was the regulator. We expect some differences of view and would rather we could stand by our actions on the basis of what we think is right for the customer, even if that means we disagree.

It is extremely important that the bank is committed to continuing in business in this country to provide essential competition in the SME sector, in particular, but also for personal customers. In that regard, Mr. Brown said in his opening statement that the bank was committed to a future in this country. I welcome this. Consultants have been appointed to look at the possible split into a good bank and a bad bank. Would Mr. Brown like to comment on this? Has there been any fallout from the IT systems failure in the summer of last year, which I accept originated at RBS? Will he also elaborate on that general topic, the future regulation of the bank and the speculation that the regulatory centre may be moved from the Irish system to that of the United Kingdom and the implications, if any, for such a move?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	642	In terms of the history of the bank, it has operated here for 177 years and is committed to the market. As I mentioned in my opening address, there are two aspects that we are dealing with: addressing the legacy issues of the past and also being able to build a sustainable business for the future. There is an ongoing review of RBS in looking at whether it should split into a good bank and a bad bank and in that scenario looking at moving impaired assets out of RBS. We are involved in that process, but no conclusion has yet been reached. We expect the review to be completed probably sometime in the next month or two. In the meantime, from my perspective, we will carry on delivering on the strategy we have outlined and will continue with the progress we are delivering. In terms of the IT incident, we have not experienced a fallout from a business perspective, as can be seen from our results. If one looks at the deposit numbers, for example, our deposits have risen by 12% year-on-year. That is as a result of the good relationship we have with our customers, the goodwill shown by our customers during that period and also the support of the staff to minimise any impact on our customers. That said, following on from the initial incident, the root cause of the problem has been fixed and we are working with RBS on an ongoing basis to ensure the resilience of all the IT systems across Ulster Bank and RBS and that they are improved. The third point was around the legal entity. There had been some discussion of this when I first arrived in Ireland. It primarily came as a result of the fact that up until ten or 15 years ago Ulster Bank had always operated under one entity which was separated into two legal entities. Therefore, we did a refresh as to what was the best structure under which we should operate. The current legal entity structure is the one within which we intend to stay. We will have an Ulster Bank Ireland Limited entity and also Ulster Bank Limited as a separate legal entity. There will be no change from the current position.

I advise members to ask one question at a time. If they have limited time, if they bunch their questions and run out of time, the questions that have been bunched will not be answered.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	644	Senator Paul Coghlan will go first.

I have four quick questions.  I welcome Mr. Brown and his colleagues. I am concerned that the Central Bank's targets will prove counter-productive. They will have the effect of increasing arrears and forcing the banks to go legal. Based on what has been said by the Bank of Ireland, AIB and in the presentation of Ulster Bank, the measures taken by the Central Bank to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears will lead to an increase in the level of mortgage arrears and increased foreclosures on home loans by the end of the year. The increase in the level of arrears seen last month will increase because the Central Bank's targets-based approach is forcing banks to move towards legal solutions or else face major capital sanctions. Mr. Brown might confirm this. Given that regulatory failure has contributed in the first place to our problems, we must be sure a tick-box approach by the Central Bank is not exacerbating the problem and forcing more people out of their homes and into arrears. Does Mr. Brown agree with this analysis? Would a less prescriptive approach by the Central Bank that recognises the difference between individual customers lead to better outcomes for them? The second question is whether the bank is writing off bank debts, specifically where a property is sold and the proceeds of the sale are inadequate to cover the shortfall on a loan. Is the bank going after the poor, unfortunate debtor for the balance, given that he or she will have lost his or her home or possibly retirement investment? Could the bank cut some slack for the genuine debtor? The committee is trying to get to grips with the definition of “strategic defaulter”. What are the characteristics of a strategic defaulter? Will Mr. Brown give some examples of the types of behaviour that characterise such a person? Does such a person exist or is it a myth of the banking sector? My final question is-----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	646	The Senator will have more questions than the time allowed to reply.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	648	He will run out of time because I will stop him.

What is the arrears level in respect of a figure of 90%? It looks bad when compared with the other banks. Was that because Ulster Bank was more responsible than the other banks or how does Mr. Brown account for this? What is behind Ulster Bank’s higher profile compared to Bank of Ireland, given that it has a smaller market share?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	650	I thank the Senator for his questions. First, in terms of the targets, as we mentioned in the discussion earlier, we will meet the targets, but we will make sure we do so in such a way that it gives the right outcome for the customer and the bank. We think there is a need for a less prescriptive approach in some circumstances for some customers. On the second point, we do not have a policy of writing off debt. We believe the solutions we have available which we offer to customers in arrears ensure people are able to keep their homes, which is the primary focus for Ulster Bank. I cannot give a definition of “strategic defaulters”. I could not even give a number for Ulster Bank, other than to say that of the people who are in arrears, 35% are not engaging with us or making payments. The last point was about arrears. Overall, if one looks at the average across the market and Ulster Bank arrears as a percentage of the value of loans, we are in line with the overall market and for buy-to-let properties, we are probably slightly better than the market. There may be individual categories in which we are better or worse, but generally we are in the pack.

I wish to start with his commitment to the market. I do not doubt his personal commitment or that of his team, but it is disconcerting for staff, some customers and the wider stakeholders in the economy to see comments in the British media which describe Ulster Bank as the fly in George Osborne’s ointment, to see that the British Prime Minister wants RBS to be returned to the private sector by the next general election in Britain in 2015 and to see Mr. Vince Cable, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, argue for a slightly different timescale. A lot of this is outside Mr. Brown’s control, given that it is part of a bigger macro issue, but will he outline his take on the situation? When he says he is committed to the Irish market, I believe that to be the case personally, but how sure can we be of that commitment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	654	The bank has been operating across the country for 177 years and, throughout the majority of that period, performing well and serving our customers well.There is no doubt that over the past few years the bank has been in financial stress and that a significant part of our portfolio is non-performing, and we are working through those issues. As we stand at the moment we need to go through the parliamentary review and wait to see the outcome of that, but clearly, as it has been scoped so far, the Government is looking at whether the bad parts of RBS - the bad bank, so to speak - should be separated from the rest. Clearly, we have parts of Ulster Bank that would meet that criteria but we need to wait to see the outcome of that. In the meantime, while that is happening, we should continue to serve our customers well and continue to deliver on the strategy to turn the bank around.

That is a fairly basic concept that most of my constituents, including those in mortgage arrears, appreciate. Obviously, there is an issue, and we have heard from Mr. Brown's colleague chief executives across the banks, of what some call strategic defaulters. Can Mr. Brown expand on that? He spoke to Deputy McGrath about it but how big a problem is that? What percentage of the people who have mortgages with Ulster Bank does Mr. Brown believe do not accept that there is a cost to living in a home?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	656	From my perspective, and as I mentioned, there is definitely a cost to living in a home, be it a mortgage, paying rent or even social housing, and it is a reasonable expectation that people should pay something to live in a home, I could not tell the Deputy the percentage of customers who do not necessarily agree with that but the fact is that 35% of our customers who are in arrears today are paying nothing towards the cost of their home.

The second point Mr. Brown made in that comment is that secured debt must be prioritised over unsecured debt. Again, this is something we have heard from the other banks and we can understand that, but another issue that has come up, and all of us meet it in our constituency offices, is that people are trying to juggle a good deal of debt, and some of that debt is essential such as car loans because they need to keep a car on the road or they need to keep their children in college. Can Mr. Brown explain to us the consideration he takes for other debts - non-mortgage debt - when reaching an agreement with his customers?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	662	Yes. I will hand over to Mr. Bell who will give the Deputy a little more detail on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	663	Without repeating what we said before, everything has to be done on an individual basis and that will come down to the reason there is an arrears problem in the first place. We find there are some customers whose difficulty in making the payment is that they may have young children who are preventing one of the family members from working. We would be very sensitive to that and we would look to make sure that we did not try to have such a high payment that it effectively compromises the family's ability to live a normal life. If anybody had loans that relate to tools of the trade, such as a car which they need for work or whatever, we would not seek to put downward pressure on that if it was legitimately related to the means of generating an income to service a loan. Where we would have some concerns is where people have multiple cars or they are making expenditure choices that do not seem to be commensurate with the fact that they may be three or more months in arrears with their home loan. In saying that, I refer to Mr. Brown's earlier point. With 72% of our mortgage customers on tracker rates of around 1.5% and with the average loan size for Ulster Bank at €173,000, it means that even a full capital and interest repayment is less than €700 a month. That is not an economic concession; that is a straight interest rate arrangement. When we look at available housing elsewhere through the private rental sector, one would be very hard-pressed to find some kind of reasonable accommodation for that, so what we try to do is instead of waiting until we have spent all the money and then see what is left to pay for the home, we try to think about what is a reasonable amount to pay towards the home loan and then make sure the rest will not compromise an ability to live a normal life.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	665	We would not typically want to do that. We would say to customers that it is an option. If the customer has got himself or herself into a position where their employment prospects have changed or if their revised income simply is not sufficient to service their ongoing obligations, it might be a better option, but in terms of the Deputy's colleague's earlier question, we would not then start chasing people for a shortfall if they had agreed to sell the property without all the costs associated with legal proceedings and all the time delays that may occur. Again, on a case by case basis, there may be circumstances where a shortfall would not be fully chased if the circumstances-----

We have had very few foreclosures. Our focus has been to ask people where they will live after this has happened because if they will have to spend 50% more to rent a place than they are to stay where they are, why can we not find a solution?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	670	I welcome the witnesses to the committee. I have been going through the figures. We have had two sessions with representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland. I will not rehearse all of that but I ask the witnesses to read the transcripts. Everything I said to them about providing the information this committee required is applicable to the witnesses also. It is disrespectful not to give us a submission and disrespectful not to give us the figures we need in written format. The witnesses know exactly what they are doing. The banks know exactly what they are doing. There are about a dozen committee members here. It is a case of running down the clock while we try to prise the information from the witnesses instead of getting to the depth of the issue. I want to move to the detail of what this proposal by Government and the Central Bank was about. The witnesses know it better than me. There were 20% targets for quarter two but that was only the first part of it. There were 30% targets for quarter three and 50% targets for quarter four. The Central Bank was supposed to come out at the start of the summer and say that those targets were offers, but they were supposed to set targets for acceptance of offers. The witnesses accept that. To meet the targets today, the witnesses have relied on 82% of the offers being legal letters. I am not sure how customers can accept those legal letters, and it is the same with AIB and the Bank of Ireland, but it goes against the spirit of what this measure that was introduced in March was all about. In my view, this was about forcing the banks finally to step up to their responsibilities and deal with this issue. In the last quarter, Mr. Brown's bank had issued 4,124 legal letters. If people are not engaging, they should be engaging. If people are not talking to the bank, they should be engaging and the bank has to do what it needs to do, but there are customers of Mr. Brown's bank who have been engaging and who are trying to come up with solutions and he has failed to come up with solutions for them. The problem here is that AIB and Bank of Ireland have done the same thing. To reach the targets, they issued a couple of thousand legal letters, but this was about the genuine people who wanted a solution to allow them get on with their lives. Why did the witnesses not deal with that? If they take away the legal repossessions, the number of long-term offers made in quarter two was 1,048, which would mean that they missed the target by about 75%. Bank of Ireland relied 50% on legal letters, AIB relied 70% on legal letters and Ulster Bank are relying 82% on legal letters. That is my first question. Why did Ulster Bank not deal with the customers who genuinely are engaging and want a resolution but who have not been offered one so far?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	671	I thank the Deputy for the comments. In terms of the specific question, we did include a significant number of legal cases in the reporting of our quarter two numbers. That was the result primarily of customers who have not engaged with us at all. Separate to that we have 4,038 customers who are on long-term arrangements and we have another 511 who are on short-term arrangements. As we mentioned earlier, we chose to take a very conservative approach to what we included in terms of it being a sustainable solution or not, and hence the reason we have reported the lower figure but, overall, we have over 4,000 customers who are in a long-term arrangement with the bank outside the legal process. I do not know if Mr. Bell wants to add any further to that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	672	I would just say that the target issue was there to drive better payment solutions and not simply to drive litigation.However, when a target is issued that has significant financial consequences for not hitting it, boards of directors will then do what they must to hit that target. Unfortunately, while I am not pointing any fingers anywhere because we are as responsible as anyone and regrettable as it is, there was a two-year period in which there was no credible threat of consequence and limited ability for banks to contact customers and in which that natural dialogue between bank and customers has broken down. It will take more than a few weeks for that relationship to re-establish. Looking forward, while there is a very high proportion of legal cases in the quarter two target, we do not expect to see that rising significantly through the remaining two quarters. However, we expect to see a very significant increase in the payment relationships that we establish in the rest of the year.

Moreover, Ulster Bank itself expects this is not a long-term solution because it expects the threat of repossession will not materialise in the majority of cases. I wish to ask a question of Mr. Brown. When I spoke of the target, he talked of 4,038 long-term solutions. However, the aforementioned 4,038 long-term solutions cannot be included in the data Ulster Bank provides to the Central Bank to reach the target. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	674	On the earlier comment, we have 4,000 customers that we have entered into the legal process but we have 14,000 other customers with whom we are in dialogue or with whom we intend to get into dialogue. As I mentioned earlier, a sizeable portion of these already are in some sort of arrangement.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	678	We have chosen to take a very conservative approach to the first submission, which we made in quarter 2, as to the types of loans we should include therein. To share with the joint committee the conservative nature that we took, as I mentioned earlier, we have not yet included the 1,000 loans that are on economic concession that we have already entered into long-term arrangements. Consequently, I expect that-----
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	679	Would a sizeable proportion of Ulster Bank's long-term arrangements include interest-only?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	680	No. It is very small.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	681	To clarify that point, there has been some lack of certainty around definitions. What we did not wish to do was to have a public discussion about whether we had met a target with the Central Bank in the full glare of publicity because there are differences of interpretations about what is a long-term appropriate payment arrangement. The Chairman made some very good points on that matter earlier. Consequently, we chose to ensure the targets we declared were correct and could not be challenged, in order that we could do what we committed to do. Whatever our views may be of targets, we committed to be part of the regime and that is what we are doing. However, it is not appropriate and we would not confuse hitting the target with doing the right thing for customers. The two, to some extent, are slightly different debates with slightly different angles to them.

In an example of someone who has a €200,000 loan, what would be done by Ulster Bank is that the sum of the capital would be reduced and the interest rate would be reduced. It would then be extended over a 30-year period in a new loan. What would happen to the residual capital and interest that was not paid?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	683	If I may make two separate points, the economic concession keeps the principal as it is and reduces the interest rate to as low as 0.5%. It allows the customer to then eat into the capital repayments, while making a payment he or she regards to be reasonable and fair in an assessment with which we agree. In the case of a split mortgage, a product for which we have not seen a huge increase in demand although it is available, we would put a proportion of the debt in a sort of warehouse. No interest would be charged on it and it simply would be addressed at the end of the mortgage term or at the end of the customer's life. Sadly, this may sound a bit gross but Lorcan O'Connor has stated quite publicly that if the warehouse part of the split mortgage had to be part of the resolution of an estate, then so be it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	689	The approach we are taking is that everything should be reviewed periodically, because that is right for the customer.

There is much other detail that is missing and hopefully it will be furnished to the committee. We probably will have a further round of these meetings later in the year. Has Ulster Bank shed jobs recently, particularly in the arrears support unit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	693	No, we have not. A small number of fixed-term contracts have expired but on a net basis, we actually are adding to the Republic of Ireland employment headcount with regard to arrears management.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	694	Given the problem Ulster Bank has, why is it not renewing fixed-term contracts in the arrears support unit? Mr. Brown has explained that 35% of the bank's base, which equates to approximately 6,000 people, is not even engaging with the bank.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	695	Relatively small numbers are concerned and the reason is we want to put further investment regionally to support customers where they are, as opposed to where we are. Consequently, we have done some analysis to show there are certain counties in which there is a disproportionately high number of arrears cases and we want to put the resources there, as opposed to having it all in one centre in Dublin. It simply is a question of shifting the balance, not taking the numbers down.

His contract is not being renewed and now he cannot pay his mortgage, which is with Ulster Bank. Mr. Brown mentioned earlier that a holistic approach must be taken in this regard. The bank itself must consider some of these cases. I refer to Priory Hall and a question members have asked of the other banks. Does the bank have tenants or customers who own property in Priory Hall? Is the bank seeking to add individual solutions? AIB in particular suggested it wished to find individual solutions and it has engaged with its customers.

However, members are all concerned - and as a member of Sinn Féin I am particularly concerned - regarding the bank's commitment to its presence both here in the South and in the North. I acknowledge this is outside the witnesses' control. How many lifestyle reports has the bank conducted in respect of its customers, either itself or through its legal entities? How many such reports have been commissioned in the past and is Mr. Brown aware how much they cost on average?

Other banks are using them and Bank of Ireland has just confirmed it is using them. Basically, it employs special investigators to follow people to ascertain what type of lifestyle they are living.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	705	Perhaps I will hand that question over to Mr. Stephen Bell in a minute. On Priory Hall, Ulster Bank has 12 customers who have properties in that development. Some of those customers are making regular payments, some customers are in arrears and we are working through each customer's situations on a case-by-case basis.

That is one of the issues. If I may ask Mr. Brown a leading question, I note that AIB appeared before the joint committee yesterday. Its representatives acknowledged that while a process was under way with the banks, it was not going to work and they stated AIB's intention was to deal with the individuals with which it was concerned and was going to try to get them a new home.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	718	No doubt tracker mortgages are a drag on the industry as a whole in terms of financial performance. The reality is that the cost of funding to banks, including Ulster Bank, is higher than the base rate that those loans are benchmarked off, but right now we are looking at whether there are solutions that we may be able to offer customers that may be better than trackers. For example, as interest rates are very low right now, is it better to offer a customer a five or ten-year fixed-rate loan? We have not come to any conclusion on that. We are looking at various options, but we will look at it on a case-by-case basis. It has to be something the customer would want to enter into, and there has to be a benefit to the customer as well.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	720	On the variable rate mortgages, and for that matter all our lending facilities, we look at them on a product-by-product basis and we assess the product based on the risk that we are taking, the potential credit losses and what may generate a reasonable return. Right now, our variable rate mortgages are at 4.5%. That reflects the cost of funding to the bank, the operational costs as well as any potential credit losses that come through on that portfolio. At this stage, compared with other markets, it is a reasonable spread.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	721	I got two very different answers from AIB and Bank of Ireland when I asked about the potential for an increase in the variable interest rate in the next year. The AIB representative stated he could not really foresee it and the Bank of Ireland representative stated he would not rule it out. What is Mr. Brown's view?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	722	It depends on two key factors. One factor is what happens to the cost of funds over that period. If the cost of deposits rises, then I would expect that the rate could rise. The other key factor is what happens in terms of ongoing credit losses. We believe right now that steps that are being taken with the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears and to make changes to the Dunne ruling have clearly helped banks in their ability to collect on loans and arrears, etc., but if those tools had not been there, then it is likely that arrears could have continued to stay elevated and, therefore, the cost of those mortgages could have gone up. That aside, right now the key determinant for us is what happens to the cost of funds over the next 12 months.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	724	We are differentiating. If a customer is on a tracker mortgage and wants to move for family reasons, we will look to find opportunities to make that possible. If a customer is on a tracker mortgage and has no desire to move, we do not have many options to do anything other than live with that.

Sometimes I wonder whether this is part of the policy in the banking system where the banks talk about defaulters, the word "strategic" gets in there and, before one knows it, that seems to be all we talk about. I am not necessarily suggesting that the Ulster Bank representatives are doing that. Those are merely my own thoughts. AIB's representatives told the committee that they felt 20% of those with distressed mortgages were strategic defaulters. I apologise if Mr. Brown has already answered this question. Would the position be similar at Ulster Bank? Did Mr. Brown give a different figure?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	726	We have not stated a percentage who are strategic defaulters. What we have stated is that of the total number of mortgages that are in arrears, 35% are not engaging with us and are not paying anything.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	730	There are a combination of issues that may have led to that. One is that I do not think the banks had enough staff to talk to them, specifically on mortgage arrears. The banks also did not necessarily have the right solutions. I think that was a factor. Then one adds on the delays in resolving the CCMA, then the Dunne ruling and just the talk of default. All of those factors have probably played a part in some of those customers choosing not to pay.

It is somebody who needs help.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	734	There may be an element of those, but we actively try to encourage all of our customers who are in arrears to talk to us because we are able to come up with solutions, as we have done for many thousands of customers already.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	736	We have tried to contact them, for instance, call them, in many different ways to try to get them to engage and to date they have not, which at this stage leads us to using the legal process, which, by the way, we would rather not do. Some of those customers have not responded to any other form as of yet. What we have found is that as we have started that process, already 20% of those customers have started to engage with us and are coming to some sort of arrangement.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	737	The reason I am saying this is because when people start throwing out terminology such as "strategic defaulters", what forms in somebody's mind is an image of somebody who has a broad portfolio, is merely playing the system, is trying to out-fox the bank and is not playing ball whereas what we possibly have is somebody who is terrified of hearing the telephone ring.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	738	That is why we have said that we are focused on the fact that there are 35% of customers who are in arrears who are either not paying or not engaging with us. As to the reasons for that, whether they have chosen to default strategically, they are afraid or there is some other reason, we do not know the answer to that yet because they have not engaged with us in a way that would enable us to clarify that.

I have two quick questions. The first is on the link between mortgage arrears and unemployment. Would Mr. Brown accept that many mortgages should not have been given out?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	740	In hindsight, that is true, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	742	That is a different question.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	744	At the time, the loans were given to customers based on reasonably expected financial circumstances, for example, in terms of employment, and the reality is that since the financial crisis, customers' financial circumstances have changed. Customers have lost their jobs. Their incomes have decreased as well. In hindsight, maybe in some cases one might not have.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	745	I am sure that experience will teach Mr. Brown as to how to manage the bank's affairs in the future and the bank would never go back to that kind of practice ever again.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	746	That is correct. There are a number of practices to which the market as a whole should not go back, for example, loan-to-value ratios in excess of 90% and tracker mortgages. Those are just a couple but there are others as well.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	747	I would assume these things are written up in 9 ft. letters on the side of a wall somewhere in Ulster Bank?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	748	I think that is indelibly written into our policies going forward.

I know Mr. Brown has already made some comments about Priory Hall. The families involved in Priory Hall are clinging to every sentence from Mr. Brown. We had two different responses. The response from AIB was reasonably positive and said it would deal individually with families and that in a number of weeks it should have positive solutions for these families. It was disregarding the court case and everything else and said it would be generous, open and honest and try to find a solution for these families in the short term. This was welcomed by the families. The response heard earlier today was not as encouraging. We can easily say it can be done on a case-by-case basis and use the proper formal language or Ulster Bank can say that it is aware that the situation is unique and that it can find imaginative and positive solutions to it. Mr. Brown can give me the coal-face, strait-laced banker answer or he can give me something that the families will respond more positively to but it is over to him.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	750	I have made my comments that we are working with our customers who have properties in Priory Hall on a case-by-case basis. I do not think there is a blanket solution for individuals in that development just as there is no blanket solution for any other customers experiencing financial difficulty.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	756	It depends on each and every individual's circumstances.

We are talking about possibly a couple of dozen people in Priory Hall in Ulster Bank's case. We must get this issue resolved. I am not asking Mr. Brown for a date but does he have a quarter of this year or next year by which the Priory Hall residents' situation would be resolved?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	758	No, we do not. The reason for that is down to two things. One is that the circumstances for each individual are different. Some people are paying their loans and some are experiencing financial difficulty. There is a larger issue that needs to be resolved in this case, which is what happens to the overall Priory Hall situation regardless of whether customers have a mortgage on their properties or not.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	759	I will conclude with this. We got a positive answer from AIB but did not get a great response from Bank of Ireland but at least it said it might be influenced by what other banks might do in that regard. What I am getting from Mr. Brown is that Ulster Bank will approach it on a case-by-case basis and will not be influenced by any other factors.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	760	I have already given my answer.

I think he has been quite candid in all matters with the exception of Priory Hall. Perhaps he has been candid in that. Before we get into some of the numbers, it is worth recognising the improved performance of the bank. No doubt the members of the delegation have all been working very hard on that. I acknowledge the 0% offered on the split mortgage. It is very important and I am delighted to see that Ulster Bank is doing it unlike Bank of Ireland which is pretending to have a split mortgage product. I had not heard of the economic concession product and have not gone through the numbers on it but Mr. Bell says it works out better in terms of repayments for the consumer so I acknowledge and recognise that Ulster Bank is being creative in bringing in things that are better for the consumer than the split mortgage. I think I am right in saying that Ulster Bank is allowing people to move house and keep their tracker mortgages. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	763	We do.

In respect of voluntary surrender, there will usually be a gap between the sale price and the amount owed to the bank. Did I hear Mr. Bell say that in these cases, Ulster Bank is surrendering any legal hold on that debt to the borrower? Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	765	We are taking a case-by-case approach but where it is necessary and appropriate, we are not seeking to enforce the full shortfall.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	767	Absolutely.

I do not think Ulster Bank has hit the targets. In respect of the PDH, which is the owner-occupied section, 5,172 offers have been made but 4,124 of those are legal letters. Therefore, is it safe to say that those legal letters do not include an offer for a restructuring of the mortgage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	769	There have been many earlier correspondences which will have offered alternative solutions and they have not been taken up and typically they have not resulted in any engagement so we have hit a point where we have no other option to move the case forward.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	770	I appreciate that and have no problem with the legal letters being written. It must be deeply frustrating to have over one third of the customer base not paying anything. That must be a deeply frustrating situation to be in. The Government target is offers made that Ulster Bank deem to be sustainable against a set of criteria. I put it to Mr. Bell that while the legal letters may be necessary as part of the ongoing operations of the bank, they do not constitute long-term sustainable offers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	771	They meet exactly the definition with the Central Bank. We have discussed with the Central Bank specifically whether the approach we are taking to legal proceedings counts towards the targets and we have had confirmation that they do.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	773	We have it in a written form. Otherwise, I am happy to confirm it to the Deputy by whatever means he would like.

I do not believe the legal letters meet the spirit of what the Government is trying to do here. I believe the real figure is 1,048, which is 6% rather than 20%. However, what Mr. Bell is saying is that Ulster Bank has clarified this with the Central Bank and it is saying that legal letters, which may result in repossession which nobody wants, count as offers of sustainable solutions to borrowers which means that Ulster Bank has met its targets. If this is the case, I would like to see the Governor of the Central Bank in here as soon as possible.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	779	Managing this problem is not something one does with one instrument. The way one prevents cases getting into over 90 days arrears is as important as how one deals with cases that have already got into arrears of 90 days or more. There are over 14,500 cases that are either current or less than 90 days because we intervened and found appropriate solutions for customers. We have seen a net reduction of 549 cases in the 90 days plus portfolio over the quarter in question so I would be prepared to say I feel very strongly that we have met the spirit of the intent, which is how we provide appropriate solutions to people with genuine payment difficulties. The target regime to some extent sits alongside that, which is something we must do but it does not necessarily drive every action we take.

It seems that Ulster Bank has engaged in debt write-downs in terms of voluntary surrender. I have read reports where Mr. Brown is reported as saying that Ulster Bank will not engage in debt write-downs. What is the bank's position on debt write-downs being part of some solutions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	781	We have a policy of no debt write-downs as part of a solution. As we commented earlier, as we work through a case and there may be a shortfall once the process has completely exhausted, the bank from an accounting perspective may need to write off that loan. The reality is that there have been relatively few cases of that so far because we only recently got the tools to enable us to address the issue.

Our most recent conversations with the service suggest that is an acceptable way of dealing with the situation.

In absolute figures, how much negative equity is involved in the property for which the bank has loaned money?

I have raised this issue with the other banks. Given the disaster inflicted on ordinary home owners - I am not referring to those who bought a string of properties for speculative purposes - and the young working people in their 20s and 30s who are now obliged to pay massive amounts because of the rampant profiteering in Irish property, is it not reasonable to expect the banks, along with the Government and the European financial system, to agree a policy of general write-down of the capital value in each over-priced home to today's value and thereby calibrate downwards the monthly repayments on those properties? Is that not the ideal and proper solution for those who are in desperate straits at present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	803	From my perspective, the bigger issue is acknowledging that there is a cost to being in a home. If we look at our average mortgage and the average cost to rent, our mortgages are the same or even less than rental payments. Certainly, our repayments are considerably lower if we end up agreeing something like an economic concession. From my perspective, the key issue is to work with customers on a case-by-case basis to examine their financial situation, and for those who are not engaging or choose not to pay, to come to some realisation that there is a cost to living in a home. In our view, it is probably better for them to be talking with us and coming to an arrangement rather than to lose their homes and going out to rent.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	804	With respect, just about every ordinary home owner has experience on a monthly basis of the huge trauma of meeting the cost of staying in a home. A minority of the bank's customers are in arrears. We can be certain that among those who are not in arrears are people who are struggling to meet their payments, and other aspects of family life are suffering because of the prices gouged from them during the bubble. The issue of strategic default is being suggested as a diversion from the fact that the majority of people are not strategic defaulters but are trying to survive. Some of these people are not in arrears and others are. When the practices, profiteering and speculation of the banking system and the financial markets plunge an entire society into the mess that the Irish people experienced, is it not reasonable for me, as a public representative, to expect the system to find a more global way out rather than the case-by-case approach which leaves people at the mercy of the banks?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	805	We need to acknowledge that 80% of customers are paying their home loans and are current or less than 90 days in arrears. Some 19% or 20% of our customers are 90 days past due. In the majority of cases we are working with those customers and putting in place solutions to help them work through their financial difficulties. A small proportion - one third - of that 19% of customers are choosing not to engage with us and we need to work through the legal process to get them to re-engage. The reality is that 80% are paying their home loans.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	806	That is the point I made to Mr. Brown but many of those who were caught in the bubble are making huge sacrifices. It is also a drain on the economy because funds that should be going into goods and services to create employment are being diverted to the financial system. Rather than the business as usual approach, does Mr. Brown not think the financial system as a whole should find a global solution along the lines I mentioned?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	807	The key point we have been trying to make is that there is a cost to living in a home. The cost to the 80% of customers who are paying is the real cost of servicing the debt. In many cases, the cost to service that mortgage is cheaper than the alternative of them not having the property and moving to rent the property. It is true that property values have moved up and down. It is also true that in the first half of this year property values have increased somewhat, particularly in Dublin. The reality is that when we make a home loan available, we are looking to finance someone who chooses to move away from renting a home and wants to buy a property over a period of 25 to 35 years. That is the way we approach our mortgage business. The purpose is to help people own their homes and give them an alternative to renting whereby they can ultimately own a property.That is how we are approaching it. It is not a question of looking at the ups and downs of property valuations in the short term. If there are customers who are in financial distress we are certainly willing to engage with them to help them through the short-term solutions. However, the aim is to provide finance in order that people can ultimately own their homes.

Obviously, Mr. Brown will not agree. I do not expect, unfortunately, that the bankers and the European bondholders will become socialists overnight.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	809	Eventually.

I am curious about a comment made by Mr. Brown in the Sunday Independent in August. He was asked by the newspaper if he believed it was time for the Government to row back on austerity. He stated:It's important the government continues with the programme they've agreed with the Troika. Clearly very good progress has been made.I wonder if Mr. Brown is aware of the great contradiction in his view. He is urging the Government to proceed with a vicious programme of austerity that is taking so much from the pockets of ordinary people and making it far more difficult for them to pay their mortgages on a monthly basis and thus exacerbating the financial problems of some of the banks but mainly of themselves. Does Mr. Brown not see a great contradictory position in that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	811	There are two issues but they are related. Clearly the country has experienced financial difficulty during recent years, there has been no doubt about that. The Government's commitment in delivering on those commitments has resulted in Ireland being seen in a positive light by international markets and that is reflected, for example, by the bond rates investors pay in the market here as well. The financial difficulty that Ireland as a market got into was broader than simply the issues the Government is dealing with more directly in terms of the country. There are people who are in deep financial distress as a consequence of the financial crisis that has unfolded and a significant proportion of our customers have been impacted by that. This is why we are providing significant resources in terms of the number of people to talk to our customers and the solutions we are putting in place with the ultimate aim of helping them through their financial distress but, where possible, to try to keep them in their homes as well.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	812	I put it to Mr. Brown that in his response to the last question there is an absolute glaring double standard and contradiction. On the one hand Mr. Brown is endorsing a global solution to the Irish economic problem when it comes to imposing austerity. That is okay for the good of the economy. However, it is not okay to have a global solution when it comes to the banks acknowledging their role in getting people into the mortgage crisis they are now in and in getting the whole economy into the mess it is now in. It is a matter of case-by-case and squeeze every cent the bank can get out of the mortgage holder. However, when it comes to what the Government should do, it should have a global solution, no case-by-case approach, no fairness and no justice. It should simply impose austerity because that is what the financial markets want. Does Mr. Brown not see a glaring gross injustice in that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	813	The two issues are different. As I mentioned, in the case of customers or mortgage holders who are in financial distress, we are helping them and we are working through those issues with our customers on a case-by-case basis. As we mentioned, we have already got solutions in place for 17,000 of those customers.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	814	Then how can Mr. Brown seriously and in the same breath encourage the Government to cut people's pay, jobs and income to the extent that they are unable to pay their mortgages to the bank? That is beyond comprehension. I find it fascinating and frankly a little alarming that Mr. Brown says there is no correlation any longer between unemployment and mortgage default, the implication, nicely put, being that people are simply not bothered paying. I put it to Mr. Brown that the vast majority of people are not paying because they are having extraordinary difficulty paying. Often this is because of income loss, it is not always job loss. Incomes have been slashed in this country by between 20% and 30%. Even the people who are currently paying their mortgages are often doing so at the expense of not feeding their children properly or not being able to pay other bills. That is the position people are actually in. Therefore, I suggest that for Mr. Brown to separate the economic crisis which the banks helped to cause from the current problem of mortgage default is a sleight of hand that really becomes a justification for Ulster Bank to launch into an aggressive programme of repossessions and legal action.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	815	The first point is that the vast majority of people in Ireland are actually paying their mortgages. Fully 81% of our customers are actually paying. We have 19% of customers who are experiencing financial difficulty and the vast majority of those have entered into some arrangement with the bank. As we mentioned earlier, there is a portion, 35% of that 19%, who have not engaged with us and are not paying anything at all. The point is that 80% of customers are paying their mortgages and we have entered into arrangements with a significant proportion of the 19%.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	816	We will agree to disagree. Mr. Brown will find that Ulster Bank did not have much default before 2008 and it has a good deal of default now and for him to suggest there is no direct connection between those two things is bordering on the preposterous. Mr. Brown stated that 35% are not engaging and 35% of 15,328 home mortgages, which he says are in default of one description or another, is 5,364. The bank has already gone down the legal route in the case of 4,354 and Mr. Brown has said that 2,851 are not engaging. This makes a total of approximately 7,000, or 2,000 in excess of 35%. Does that mean there are possibly up to 2,000 people above the 35% figure who are engaging with Ulster Bank but the bank is still going down be legal route with them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	817	I will come in on that. We offered the information earlier that of the 4,300 cases where we have initiated legal action, approximately 20% have now re-engaged. It is not despite the fact that they are engaging that we have taken legal action, it appears to be because we have finally been able to take legal action that we have encouraged engagement. A high proportion of the 4,354 cases will result in a mature and sensible conversation between us and the customer such that we do not have to go to the end of that process. However, unfortunately there are still 2,851 cases where we have not got as far as the legal process and where we are unable to establish meaningful contact and we are not getting payment.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	818	The jury is out on this stuff and we will know a little more in six months or a year. It is alarming that in the case of all of the banks which have come before the committee a very high proportion of the supposed solutions they have offered to meet the targets involve their going down the legal route. One could be forgiven for thinking that there is an avalanche of repossession cases on the way. Ulster Bank maintains that is not the case but certainly the evidence at the moment at least is pointing in the direction of wholesale repossessions taking place as a result of the change in the legal obstacle.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	819	There are two key points that I wish to highlight. One is the calculation by which the 20% target was met. As we have stated already, a sizeable percentage of that was met through the legal route. However, over and above that, and not as part of the target regime, we have entered into 17,000 arrangements with our customers, some of which are pre-arrears, some of which are early arrears and some of which are more than 90 days past due. In these cases we have come to an arrangement with the customer to help alleviate the problem.There are two separate points. There is a significant amount of action to get customers into some solution that will work for them in dealing with their financial problem.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	820	I take the point which I heard earlier. The economic concession is an interesting issue. Anecdotally, what I hear is that people are not interested in split mortgages because they think they will be sunk in debt for the rest of their lives. There has been some emphasis in the media debate to the effect that split mortgages are akin to Moses and the Messiah coming to save people in mortgage distress. I do not think they are.

If Ulster Bank, unlike Bank of Ireland in cases of voluntary surrender, is not chasing as a matter of course the shortfall which is very fair and reasonable, it is, in effect, giving a write-down on an unsustainable debt.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	823	It is a write-off.

Why does it not give them an incentive to stay in their homes and give them a write-down? Why would Ulster Bank not extend that logic to keep people in their homes? I do not understand. The bank is going to take the hit.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	825	Just to be clear, on the issue of a write-off, what we said was that when we have exhausted all avenues for recovery, there may be a situation where, from an accounting perspective, we may have to write off a loan. That is different from writing down. We believe that with the solutions we have in place, be it economic concessions or some other form, there are sustainable solutions we can offer customers that will keep them in their homes that do not necessitate the need to write down the loan.

The bank must recognise its role in creating the fear and genuinely reach out to people by saying it will help people to stay in their homes if that is at all possible and that it is willing to take some responsibility for its role in the mess in working out a solution with them. If that message was sent, it would begin to change the dynamic.

Before we move on, I wish to clarify two issues with Mr. Brown. As the targets that have been set by the Central Bank increase, what are the penalties for the bank if they are not reached?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	831	There are potential penalties in terms of additional capital overlays.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	833	Ultimately, an additional capital overlay – I think it is about €600 million-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	834	The way the mortgage arrears document from 30 March is written, it states that in the event that the bank fails to hit the target, it would no longer be able to make any assumption of future cure rates for people who are more than 90 days in arrears. It is very difficult to say, but one would have to assume that in every case 90 days plus in arrears the property would simply be repossessed. All banks, as a matter of international accounting policy, make assumptions about cure rates and they can vary by between 25% and 30%. One is effectively saying that for all of the balances 90 days plus in arrears, a significant proportion would either become an additional provision or additional capital.

In the joining of the dots the banks need capital to support their future business, as well as in dealing with the problems of the past. If more capital is consumed in dealing with the problems of the past, there will be less to support investing in growth in the future. We are determined to ensure we do not inadvertently end up having capital tied up in something that is avoidable.

The sum of money would not come through Government capitalisation but would have to be found from another source. I wish to deal with the issue of debt burdens and the write-down of debt. I am surprised that Ulster Bank has made a categorical statement this afternoon that it will not engage in any debt write-down. I am not talking about a blanket debt write-down, which I do not think anybody is suggesting. It would be nonsensical because if it were to happen it would just create an incredible situation. Some of my colleagues might use a discourse or theoretical framework that would not immerse itself with what might be seen as capitalist bankers and they might be coming from a different perspective. I will speak in capitalist terms about a debt write-down. Like the other banks, Ulster Bank wants to see normalisation in the housing market. It wants to engage with new mortgage customers and bring in new loans. That is the business it is in and it wants to increase numbers. Mr. Bell gave an indication, with Mr. Brown, as to what prudential lending practices will be in the future. We will see loan-to-values, LTVs, ratios of 90%. What ratios in terms of income are we talking about?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	838	First, we are active in the mortgage market. Last year we lent €270 million, which was up significantly on the previous year and expect the amount of new lending to be higher than that again. We are actively in the market for lending. In terms of prudential debt ratios, again, it depends on level of income, but my expectation is that it would be three to four times one's income. Mr. Bell might want to add some colour to this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	839	There are different ways of looking at this. It is not in any way unusual for net disposable income of 40% to 50% being allocated to home loan repayments. That is usually where the lender will stress that amount to cater for circumstances.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	840	The national industrial wage is approximately €37,000. Let us round it up to €40,000. A couple with one person earning just over the national industrial wage of €40,000 and with a partner working part time on €20,000 has €60,000 gross coming into the house every year. They would have to meet the 10% deposit themselves. In principle, what level of mortgage would be given to the couple under the criteria applied by Ulster Bank?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	841	It is difficult to work out the calculations.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	843	The average loan size for Ulster Bank is €173,000. I would not see it being particularly different from that figure, given the circumstances outlined.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	844	Someone on the national industrial wage who is cohabiting with somebody on half the industrial wage or a little more than this is in the ball-park for lending of €150,000 to €170,000.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	845	I was trying to do the math backwards, but I would have thought that with the marginal tax rate at less than 50%, one would be talking about €30,000 to €35,000 of net disposable income and at four times the amount, it would be in the territory of €150,000 to €160,000.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	846	By my calculation, somebody on the national industrial wage should be able to buy a three-up, three-down entry level house on a regular estate in a normalised market. That would indicate to me a return to normalisation. The difficulty is that six or seven years ago the people concerned were getting loans in excess of €250,000 and as much as €350,000. That is the problem. Even if they do not lose their jobs and become unemployed or see a reduction in wages, they are knackered. They cannot pay their existing loans. The fear I have is that Ulster Bank does not engage in sustainable solutions with those people whose debts span 35 years. At the latter end of a 20 year or 25 year schedule, paying a mortgage is a hassle, but it can be paid. On a 35 year schedule, when children are going to university, one is only halfway through the mortgage. Big bills are coming in when one should be seeing the end of it. Further debt difficulties are coming down the line for the people concerned. Leaving dogmatic left-wing, communist or socialist rhetoric to one side - I am talking in capitalist terms - the bank is not making sense.

I strongly suggest to the witnesses that Ulster Bank will have to review that, and I am not talking about blanket write-downs of 100%. Otherwise it will push people into personal insolvency arrangements that they do not want to be in.

The key comes back to affordability and looking at each case on its merits. Regarding the case he has outlined, in my view, that would be a case in which an economic concession may be required where the bank significantly reduces the interest rate it is receiving-----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	854	Reduce the variable that they are on at present.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	855	That is right. Reduce the interest rates so that a greater proportion of the repayment can go towards reducing the principal over time. That is why we think that is a better example than the split mortgages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	856	As stated, the estimates around net disposable income or income multipliers are based on a more normalised interest rate environment. As we have said before, with 72% of customers on a tracker rate where the interest rate is 1.5%, obviously that gives one a different profile to examine.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	857	One of the things I am picking up from Ulster Bank, and I will refer to it in my summation, is that it is looking at some solutions that seem to be outside the prescribed list. One of the misconceptions about buying a house for €150,000 or buying a house for €300,000 is that the person does not pay back €150,000 or €300,000. They pay a staged payment every month for the next 20 to 35 years and the net sum is what they actually pay for that house. Mr. Brown is suggesting this afternoon that by way of the restructuring, that net sum over the 25 to 35 year period reduces.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	858	Yes.

I want to pick up on a few points. I want full clarification on the legal aspect. I am looking at quarter two, the figure for which I believe was 4,124. Mr. Brown said that 20% of those have now re-engaged. Were letters sent to all those people and what criteria would the bank use in terms of legal letters being sent out? For instance, in the case of AIB, that was done when it had not received payments in three years. Bank of Ireland appeared to operate that. What would be Ulster Bank's criteria on that? Mr. Brown might give me a general overview on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	863	When we looked at the cases to go into the legal system we challenged ourselves to make sure we had exhausted every possibility, and so in 1,400 cases, we sent a further letter out to make sure we had given people every single opportunity to respond to that change-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	867	No. That is absolutely not. The last letter before we go into the legal system is reasonably strongly worded and states: "If we cannot now reach some kind of accommodation we will have to then consider ...". Even at that point we do not regard that as legal. We have only regarded things as legal once we have appointed solicitors. We believe that we have taken all reasonable steps to ensure the customer is aware of the next step in the process.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	868	Of that 4,124, 20% have re-engaged. Therefore, it is about 800 or 900.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	869	Yes, so far.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	871	When we look at international comparisons, where the legal market has been unaffected by matters such as the Dunne ruling, up to 70% of customers respond positively when the legal process commences and the best solution can be reached. One would hope to get somewhere nearer to 70% than 20%, but what we have been very clear about with all of our different stakeholders is that this is a situation that has been two years in the making. It will take more than two months for it to be resolved.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	872	If it transpires that some of those end up as voluntary repossessions or repossessions, what view does Mr. Brown take on the balance of the negative element of the equity?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	873	It is always done on a case-by-case basis. If a customer was manifestly unable to service the debt and was clearly going to be in a difficult position, the calculation any bank would make to avoid what could be anything from €3,000 to €13,000 in legal costs and anything up to five years of delay in resolving the situation is whether it makes sense if the customer works in a sensible way with the lender to resolve that with a mutually agreeable sale. Would we look favourably at whatever the residual might be and, on a case-by-case basis, yes we would.

He stated that the bank's level of arrears provision has gone down, which is the opposite of the position in the other institutions that have come before the committee.

Will Mr. Brown explain that? It appears to go against current trends and I wonder about the reason for that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	879	We have had a decrease in our arrears for the past five months.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	881	We have not written anything off.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	883	The approach we have taken is that we have treated any customer who is in arrears as a high priority. It does not matter whether they are one day past due or two years past due; everybody is a high priority. We have increased the number of people to contact the customers experiencing arrears in that we now have 400 people making calls. That is the first point. The second point is that we have come up with a wide range of solutions. We have talked about some of the more innovative ones. We have a wide range of solutions available to customers, but the initial approach we are taking to customers in terms of the calls we make is to get them back into the habit of paying something towards their arrears. The second approach is highlighting to customers that in many cases the arrangements they can come to with us to resolve their financial situation is in many cases cheaper than the cost it would be for them to rent. It is contacting customers, sharing with them the implications of not paying, getting them into the habit of paying something and then working through a sustainable solution. That is the order in which we have approached it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	892	Until April 2011, mortgage arrears for both markets were highly correlated.As unemployment was rising, so mortgage arrears were also rising. That is quite common across more markets than just simply the North. A number of factors have happened in the Republic - such as the inability to contact, not having the Dunne ruling sorted out, the lack of a credit bureau and so on - that in our view have had an impact on our ability to collect and may have been a factor in causing a divergence in the correlation between mortgage arrears and unemployment. What has happened is that since 2011, that correlation has continued to hold in the North. Even though unemployment is rising, arrears are rising. However, in the Republic, unemployment has come down from its peak of 15.1% to 13.7% but over the same period, arrears have increased. Over the same period, the average repayment on a tracker mortgage has reduced and so what we are highlighting is that other factors must be at play here that have caused that correlation to break down.

It is actually higher than AIB's level. The latter bank has put out a figure to the effect that 20% of its customers in arrears are strategic defaulters. Ulster Bank is telling members that it is 35%. Does Ulster Bank have empirical evidence for that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	915	We would not start to get into this definition of "strategic default", which has so many different meanings to so many different people. I guess that what we are seeing is that mortgage arrears tend to be accompanied by difficulties with other outlays. We carried out some analysis on the standard financial statements and found that for every €1 of mortgage repayments, there was in excess of 60 cent of unsecured debt repayments. If someone is prioritising the repayment of short-term consumer finance and, as a result, is prejudicing his or her ability to remain in his or her home, we would consider that to be a bad choice. As to whether it constitutes strategic default is not really for me to say. Where we see people who, month after month, simply do not pay anything and do not respond to considerable attempts from us to contact them, we would regard that as being something beyond bad form and to be something we need to deal with quite vigorously.

I welcome the witnesses from Ulster Bank. The sentence on page 3 of the opening statement, "there is a cost to living in a home", needs rephrasing. Both members and the people know this. As the witnesses are aware from The Economist over the years, Ireland had the highest house price inflation of any country for which Pam Woodall collected the data. Mr. Bell has just stated it is 40% of one's disposable income. Consequently, that statement must be rephrased. People know darn well what is the cost of living in a home, because they have been paying it. There is house tax, water tax and television tax. According to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, even if one lives in a cave, one still will be obliged to pay that tax. Moreover, there has been a 25% reduction in retail sales in this economy. Consequently, it is insensitive to include that sentence to the effect that people do not know this. They are groaning under the burden and it plays a major part. What loan-to-value ratio is being used in the Ulster Bank at present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	918	On the Senator's first point, we agree there is a cost of living in a home. We do not disagree with that at all.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	920	What we are pointing out is there is a significant minority of customers who are in arrears in their mortgage and who are paying nothing towards the cost of living in the home in question. That is where we have the issue. We want those customers to engage with us and for them to work with us on coming to an arrangement whereby we can keep them in their homes but also have them servicing their mortgages. That is the point we were trying to make. As for the current loan-to-value ratio up to which we will lend, it is 90%. Generally speaking - Mr. Bell may correct me if I am wrong in this regard - most of the new loans we advance are between 65% and 70% of the value of the property.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	921	I welcome that because I do not think we should go over 80%. I believe that was the cause of the problem, which included Ulster Bank. In the history of this decade, albeit before Mr. Brown's time, Ulster Bank changed from being an industrial bank to being a major ingredient in the Irish property bubble. I have discussed this with people such as Frank O'Reilly, the previous chancellor of Trinity College. This was a huge mistake, as we need banks that get involved in industry and agriculture and do not become so exclusively property-based as did Ulster Bank and all the others as well. I believe that behaving that way was the core of the problem and that loan-to-value ratios should never again exceed 80%. I refer to the letters that were issued as part of the 5,176 adjustments, that is, legal letters were issued in 4,128 cases and long-term solutions amounted to 1,048. I believe Mr. Bell referred to this issue earlier. Does issuing such letters meet what the Central Bank was trying to do or, as was hinted earlier, is it that when banks come under pressure, they redefine the rules to define these letters as being part of the adjustment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	922	Yes, that metric does count towards the inclusion of having met the targets.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	923	It may be that in time, those legal letters will have no effect if it is seen to be the result of irresponsible lending by banks and a judge could very well make such a decision. Members encountered cases yesterday of people who had bank debt of more than €300,000 and an income of €40,000. If Ulster Bank has any similar cases on its books, it is quite likely that a judge will state the bank was responsible through reckless lending. Consequently, were one to assume that all this is the kind of adjustment the Central Bank seeks, the mere issuing of 4,128 letters might not accomplish what Ulster Bank seeks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	924	The reason we are issuing the legal letters is because we are looking for customers to re-engage with us in order that we can come to some sustainable solution. The problem today is that those customers have not engaged, despite us contacting them through letters, by telephone or whatever it may be. Consequently, that has left us no recourse but to issue the letters. Having said that, since we have issued the letters, we already have had 20% engage with us. If the trend continues as per other international markets, we expect this could increase to as much as 70%. While we still are very early into the process, I do expect to see a lift from more than 20%.

On Mr. Brown's econometrics that applied before to large chunks of the economy, where people in work have been seriously deprived of income, I would expect Northern Ireland to be doing better and the relationship might still hold.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	933	What we were highlighting - we used Northern Ireland as an example because it had very similar economic stresses, with property inflation, etc. - was that in most markets there was a direct link between unemployment and mortgage arrears. If unemployment rises, mortgage arrears rise and as unemployment falls, mortgage arrears tend to fall. That was the case in the Republic up until April 2011, but since then unemployment has come off its peak and we are still seeing a rise in mortgage arrears. That is the point we were trying to make.

Canada is one such jurisdiction. As a result, it did not have a property bubble because the affordability and valuations of properties were triangulated whereby the insurance companies would not stand over insuring a loan if they thought the property was overvalued. Would Mr. Brown hold a view that, as we learn these lessons, a similar approach should be considered whereby it would be mandatory to have mortgage protection insurance for payment, which would also give the State an insulated period of time before it would have to make an intervention?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	940	That is something we would have to take away and look at more deeply. Our approach to lending, as we have outlined, in terms of income multiples or loan-to-value ratios, is such that we are trying to make matters plain vanilla and as simple as possible, but it is something we should probably take up and have a look at and come back to the committee, if that is okay.

I was surprised this morning when Bank of Ireland stated it because I thought it was merely confined to principal mortgages or home owners. Is Ulster Bank applying split mortgages in the buy-to-let sector also?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	942	No.

What we are looking at is whether the rental income being derived from a tenant is being used to pay the mortgage. If it is not, we have little option but to intervene because otherwise the money would be used elsewhere. If there was a genuine set of circumstances, we would be happy to consider it, but it is not likely to be the case.

I thank Mr. Brown for coming. I have a certain amount of sympathy for him, as I do for all his peers in the other banks, in this regard only, that he is the meat in the sandwich. Where are the banks' boards of directors? They direct the banks and the financial sector. They are the guys who signed off on the behavioural policies and strategies of the banks leading up to 2008. They are the guys who were the architects of and designed the balance sheets that led to weighted average loans-to-deposit ratios of 170%. Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, was steady, at a figure between 135% and 140%, for several years. A credit bubble is what causes an asset price bubble and it is the houses priced in markets that people live in. The cumulative derogation by the boards of banks during that six year period meant a cumulative turbo-charged rise in asset prices and when they collapsed, 100% of the loans was still in place. That is what is shocking and unjust. There is nothing personal in this, but I wish the directors were here. They are getting big fees and telling these guys what to do. They are telling Mr. Brown and his colleagues to try to fight with limited ammunition and their hands tied behind their backs because they have not stood up and matched their responsibilities. There was a lethal cocktail. Mr. Brown's bank offered tracker mortgages. Bank of Ireland has whinged that more than half of its mortgages are tracker mortgages and that they are loss-making. Whose big idea was it to give them, if they were going to be loss-making? Was it a way to get market share for three years and then switch everybody to variable rate loans and was it a case that asset prices would remain high? That could never have happened in the ponzi scheme they had created. Now citizens are financial galley slaves, including Deputy Spring and his generation. I am lucky. My youngest is 22 years old and one of mine is in Australia. That is why Mr. Brown has an anomaly whereby he is wondering as the arrears are rising at a time when unemployment is falling. There is emigration. Those who are stuck here are unemployed and the ones who are getting deeper into debt. The lethal cocktail of tracker mortgages, loss-making products which all of the banks like lemmings raced over the cliff to provide, is still in place. The banks have a problem and it is a capital problem. This morning Bank of Ireland told me that the provisions of AIB, at 18.5% of its total loan book of €89 billion, were different from those of Bank of Ireland and that Bank of Ireland was not comparable to AIB because it had a different spread of risk and portfolio. I do not believe that because Bank of Ireland stated, in the original listing in September 2009, in the PwC list of runners and riders for NAMA, that it had gross loans of €16 billion to go into NAMA. In three months it changed and, suddenly, the bank's portfolio had improved and gross loans of only €12 billion went into NAMA. My suspicion is that Bank of Ireland wanted to stay out of majority State control. That is what all of the banks were trying to do at the time because they did not understand the ponzi scheme of credit. There was this wall of asset prices that was going to collapse and leave the loans with families and businesses to be crushed, distressed and demoralised. My heart goes out to the individual families affected, to the bread winners and those who are receiving less income.

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	950	Senator Barrett is correct. The bank did have those standard financial statements before the bubble. What happened then? What minds were working? At the top were they cocaine fuelled rather than credit fuelled? It is a very serious responsibility with which we have been left. Bank of Ireland had €61 billion of senior secured debt on its balance sheet in March 2008. That is nearly the amount of money the troika has lent to the country. One bank had senior secured debt resulting in this credit-fuelled bubble and asset prices that were going to collapse. That has now all whittled down. Does Mr. Brown know who paid the bonds? It was the euro system. The Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank gave the busted zombie banks, which remain zombie, the cash to pay the bondholders. Even the hedge fund managers could not believe it.They thought the world had gone mad. They expected the bondholders to take a bath but they did not. The ECB stepped in first, followed by the Central Bank to create promissory notes with joint sign-off and signature of the Governor of the Central Bank. There were three waves of promissory notes totalling €31 billion. There was no deal earlier this year. It was given to us because Ireland would not have survived without the conversion of the promissory note into a series of 40-year bonds for an equivalent amount. The liability to the euro system remains. We should be going in with our shirts off and our sleeves rolled up to tell Mr. Draghi that it is all wrong and the €75 billion is actually €100 billion of losses in the six Irish banks. The losses for Ulster Bank amount to €15 billion or €16 billion and its loan book peaked at approximately €50 billion. My figures are right. Bank of Ireland is in cloud cuckoo land if it thinks provisioning of 8% on a loan book worth €95 billion is sufficient. That is nuts because only 26% of that overall loan book involves normal businesses producing goods and services. The remainder is property related, whether mortgages, buy-to-let, construction, development or investment properties.  Deputies Higgins, Boyd Barrett and Donnelly and Senator Barrett are right but the great gap is the lack of outside directors. I realise it is tough. I have worked in banking. This is why I understand what I am saying. I had to do the collections in ICC Bank. It is off the map now. Senator Barrett noted that we need the banks to help SMEs and understand business and industry. That is what ICC did. It was an equity bank but HBOS took it over and trashed it. It is now sinking and writing off between 45% and 50% of its entire loan book as it settles its debts.

There is no communication because people are frightened. Luckily I only have a current account with Bank of Ireland. When I ring that bank's branch in Stillorgan my call is diverted to a call centre in Limerick. It is mad. The banks paid millions of euro to management consultants to tell them how to run their businesses but they cannot even communicate internally. The people in Limerick do not know whether I am 22 or 62 years old. They just hear a voice even though I have been a customer of Bank of Ireland for 45 years. Why should people engage? They are getting letters but do not know who is writing them. When they contact their banks they are transferred to a call centre or an automated menu. There is music while they are on hold. It is mad. A mortgage is a loan secured on an asset. If all things are equal in terms of multiples of earnings, the guidelines on prudential borrowing are observed and loan-to-deposit ratios are maintained at 90% over time, a credit bubble mathematically cannot happen. The boards, in all their stupidity, allowed it to happen and, boy, they let it rip. They compounded the problem by offering tracker mortgages, which are loss makers. These are the people who are now supposed to vet people getting back on their feet. It is unbelievable.

The customers cannot create credit for themselves. They receive credit and in turn the banks get credit from investors, including in senior secured debt in the case of Bank of Ireland. That bank hosed €61 billion in senior secured debt at the people and invited them to take out tracker mortgages. It did not say it was creating a bubble that would burst.

Much of our emphasis has understandably been on the 19% of borrowers who are in arrears of 90 days or longer. I want to focus on the other 81% of borrowers. Mr. Bell spoke about current lending practice and the bank's lending rates in the mortgage market. It is difficult to put all of the aforementioned 81% of borrowers in the same boat but a significant number are under enormous pressure to balance electricity bills, gas bills, school expenses and car and health insurance in order to pay their monthly mortgage repayments. Is the bank stress testing these borrowers in regard to their ongoing capacity to repay their mortgages? In the context of how a mortgage applicant would be evaluated today, Mr. Bell indicated that up to 40% of disposable income is used as the basis for repayment capacity. How many of these borrowers are paying more than 40%? How many are paying 50% or 60% of their disposable incomes to remain on the right side of the line? What is his prediction in regard to how many of that cohort are likely to fall into the arrears bracket in the next three months?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	969	We have seen a reduction in the arrears in our portfolio over the last five months. While the figure for arrears of 90 days past due is still at 19%, it has decreased from where it stood previously. We stress test the portfolio to determine whether customers may be about to get into financial arrears and we speak to them about putting solutions in place. We have already done that with several thousand cases. We have been proactive in entering into arrangements and the loans remain current as a consequence. I ask Mr. Bell to speak further on the issue of stress testing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	970	More than 14,500 customers who are either up to date or fewer than 90 days past due are already on alternative payment arrangements because they have contacted us or we have contacted them out of fear that they may be experiencing stress that will in due course manifest itself as arrears. We are being proactive in contacting such customers. An outreach programme has been put in place as part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears strategy, which we think is a good idea in terms of encouraging banks to engage with people who might get into difficulty and not just those who are already in difficulties. It remains the case that the average mortgage size with Ulster Bank, limited to the average interest rate prevailing, produces a monthly payment of less than €700 or, with economic concessions, considerably less than that. If somebody's circumstances mean he or she simply cannot afford to live anywhere unless the housing is provided by the State, it is difficult to see where alternative accommodation could be found for the level of monthly payment we could construct for a mortgage.We should talk about home loans, but we should also remember that it is about keeping people in their homes. Even the Personal Insolvency Act is very clear that unless the cost of a home is unreasonably burdensome, we should not be looking to move people out of their homes. Therefore, our approach is entirely to work with customers to ensure they can afford the repayment on some basis that makes sense, that allows them to remain in their homes.

There are those who, for some reason, continue to pay enormous amounts of their disposable incomes. Is Ulster Bank stress-testing them on the basis of a profile of their category of employment and level of income? In the solutions it puts in place does it use the criteria it now applies in respect of mortgage approvals? What level of disposable income does the bank consider it appropriate to take?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	972	We were very actively involved in the discussions with the IBF and the Central Bank around what is soon to be the pilot exercise to examine the wider debt position in which customers find themselves. There is a "waterfall" arrangement which uses internationally recognised practices to walk through a customer's personal situation to see to what point on the waterfall one needs to go to resolve the underlying issue. We fully support this, were very much engaged in its design and incorporate it as a key part of our conversation strategy with our customers. The whole thing is based on whether the nature of the arrears is short term and if a small change in domestic expenditure can solve the problem, that is probably fine. Where we see customers spending more on unsecured debt than they are paying on their home loan, we encourage them to talk to their unsecured lending providers. The committee is aware that the banks have collectively agreed to deprioritise unsecured borrowings the customer has to give primacy to the home loan. For the vast majority of customers, a combination of-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	974	That is across the main IBF membership.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	976	We have an agreement through the IBF that if Ulster Bank held an unsecured loan and Bank of Ireland held the mortgage, we would step back from any collection strategy on the unsecured loan to ensure the mortgage could be maintained. We think that is a very important principle for the return to normal performance of the market.

If one enters into that arrangement, one burns one's local credit union as the unsecured creditor. Some mortgage holders are reluctant to engage in that process because in a couple of years' time they may have a child who is going to college and want to borrow €5,000 and it is unlikely that Ulster Bank or any other bank which holds the major mortgage debt will be inclined to give them a hearing. That is why there is a reluctance to engage in this process, because the unsecured creditor is very often a person the customer knows in the local credit union.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	978	We have been involved in those discussions. The key point is that approximately two thirds of the unsecured debt is with the banks and we have worked through that process as part of the discussions the IBF facilitated. Separately we are involved in discussions facilitated by the Central Bank on how to deal with unsecured debt other than that at the banks.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	982	I would have liked to have raised this issue with the other banks and perhaps the committee might do so. Ulster Bank's customers have been very loyal to the bank, despite last year's IT fiasco. It has 1.3 million customers here and 2 million across the island of Ireland. It is closing a number of branches - the number is on its website. It has slipped out that the bank intends to close another 39 branches in the future. As we discussed the issue of debt write-down, I will not go into it again. These branches are central features in many towns and villages. There is no Ulster Bank in my parish, but there were three banks which are now closed. They are centrepieces of the town, but they will be left idle for a long time because they are not suitable for anything else. I ask the banks to come together to develop an initiative which could see some of these properties handed over to the local communities on a long-term lease or for a nominal fee if it could be shown it would be for a community benefit. This would reward the loyalty of its 1.3 million customers in the South and its 700,000 customers in the North. The bank wants to be profitable and get its assets back, but many of these properties will lie idle for a long time and I am asking whether it would consider such a scheme. Ulster Bank could take the lead, but I also make the same suggestion to Bank of Ireland. It would also take the sting out of the fact that the bank was withdrawing from the community.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	983	Branches are vitally important to Ulster Bank and play a key role from a community perspective, as Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned, and in terms of interaction with the bank for business, as well as retail customers. The way customers interact with the bank is changing rapidly. Last year Ulster Bank processed 200 million transactions for our customers. Some 22% of these transactions were processed through branches, 45% through new technology such as mobile applications and the Internet, while the rest were processed through ATMs, etc. The change in the branch network is driven significantly by changes in customer behaviour. We expect the traditional branch network to reduce over time, but we also expect an increase in other physical points of presence such as kiosks, mini branches or tie-ups with third parties. There is a change in customer behaviour. We are making significant investments in serving the customer through the changes they want. The way people interact through branches is evolving. We are doing things aside from investing in technology to support this; for example, our call centre has gone 24 hours a day, seven days a week from the beginning of August. We have not communicated this widely, but a sizable number of customers are ringing through that channel and we are doing other things also. We would be happy to engage in a discussion to investigate the details of Deputy Pearse Doherty's proposal. We would be happy to participate.

I understand having a call centre out of hours, but I find it bizarre when I am trying to telephone my branch that I am diverted to somebody who tells me he or she will act as an intermediary with my bank and that I will receive a call back some time. That disconnect between bank customers and the local people in the bank whom they usually like and with whom they have a relationship is crazy. It does not make sense from any point of view and the bank needs to think about this. The budget is coming. Ulster Bank has been reported as stating it thinks the Government should stick to the troika arrangement.

One of the administrative staff has just told me that people are telephoning the Oireachtas to complain about the fact that mobile phones were turned on during this meeting. They are watching the meeting live and cannot hear what people are saying. I have just heard another phone go off. If it happens again, I will have to ask the member to leave the meeting.It is very irritating for people who are watching this evening's proceedings and hoping to hear some positivity from the banks about movement if they cannot hear anything other than a buzz. I ask the Deputy to turn off his telephone.

Mr. Brown is on record as having said the Government should continue with the troika's austerity programme. It was put to him that there is a big contradiction between that and the sustainability of people being able to make their mortgage repayments. Regardless of what he might have said in the past, not only for those currently in mortgage distress who are trying to move to a sustainable position, but also for many of the 80% who are put to the pin of their collar to make their payments, should Mr. Brown not change his view and urge the Government not to do anything in the budget that would impact negatively on the incomes of ordinary people in terms of social welfare cuts, income cuts or increased taxes on people who could be in mortgage distress?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	988	The key point from my perspective is that it is vital that the Government continues on its programme to restore Ireland to the position it was in before the financial crisis. My point is that the Government is making good progress in doing so and that should continue. That has been recognised by markets in countries outside the Republic. Separately, it is very clear that customers have been through deep distress as a consequence of the crisis. At Ulster Bank, we are trying to work through solutions that can assist people to make payments on their mortgages while, importantly, also keeping them in their homes.

The numbers would help the committee in its subsequent deliberations. Regarding the rent receivers, we have concerns that the resident has not defaulted - it may be the principal private residence. The landlord has defaulted, but in some cases the receivers are seeking vacant possession, which means the tenant who has paid does not enjoy protection under the Family Home Protection Act and is evicted or faces the threat of eviction. Does the bank have a policy with the receivers that they are to pursue the landlord and not the tenant?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-09-04 00:00:00	Overview of Financial Sector: Discussion with Bank of Ireland	997	From our perspective, we are looking for the rent the tenant is paying to come to the bank to service the mortgage rather than going to the landlord.

There is no point in giving it out to third parties and not having the skills to anticipate the problems in the future.

I thank Mr. Brown, Mr. Bell and Mr. Leahy for appearing before the committee this afternoon. I appreciate how they engaged with the committee. We have requested the Governor to appear before the committee and he will do so on 25 September. In preparation for that meeting I will probably write to Ulster Bank in coming days requesting a breakdown of the number of people in a resolution process as it determines the guidelines to be. We would like an itemised breakdown with regard to mortgage-to-rent, if that has happened in some cases, split mortgages and other resolution processes. Further to what Mr. Brown has told us this afternoon, I would be grateful if he could indicate some other solutions Ulster Bank has been applying that are outside the prescriptive list of resolutions. He has had some interesting things to say this afternoon about how the bank is operating solutions other than split mortgages because customers are finding that a more sustainable long-term approach. I would be particularly interested in hearing any solutions the bank may be applying or considering applying that are not allowed by the Central Bank at the moment, such as the concept of an interest-only payment post-retirement. At the moment, resolution processes require a home owner to have the mortgage cleared or some resolution in place in order that there is no legacy issue on retirement.I would appreciate it if that could be forwarded to the committee prior its meeting with the Governor. The witness was quite frank earlier in stating that prior to publication of the Keane report, there were no targets, the options open to the bank were limited, but that they have since broadened out and that there may be other options that need to be considered. There may well be unforeseen difficulties that are now arising in respect of which a strategic approach is required. One of these is access to emergency credit or payment breaks. There may be other issues of which we are not aware currently that we need to know about. We would welcome any further thoughts Mr. Brown may have that may be relevant as we work together to try to resolve this difficulty. A number of curve balls have been thrown over the past couple of days in regard to strategic defaulters. If there are strategic defaulters, they should be pursued to the high heavens. The mission of this committee is to try to ensure that people who are in serious difficulties and are doing their darndest to resolve those difficulties are provided with solutions that are sustainable. By sustainable I mean a solution which allows them meet some level of obligation, work their way through their difficulties, see light at the end of the horizon and, like the banks who want to become viable and profitable, become viable citizens and customers. I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee today.
