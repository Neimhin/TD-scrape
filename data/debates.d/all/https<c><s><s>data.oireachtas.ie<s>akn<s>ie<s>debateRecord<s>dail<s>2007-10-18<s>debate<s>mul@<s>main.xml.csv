In view of the importance of this issue, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to my request.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	No, the Labour Party will not agree to take this item until arrangements are made to enable the Minister for Transport to come before the House to make a comprehensive statement and answer questions about the state of his knowledge concerning the removal of the Shannon-Heathrow service.  We have learned in recent days from freedom of information requests submitted by the Irish Examiner and parliamentary questions tabled by Deputy Kieran O’Donnell that the Department was aware as of 13 June that the Shannon-Heathrow service was at risk.  The Minister wants us to believe he did not receive the note prepared for him in the Department; was not informed or briefed on the matter when he took office or at any time subsequently; that on the occasions he discussed Aer Lingus with his officials between 13 June and the end of July, as he must have done, the issue was not raised; that when news of the removal of the Shannon-Heathrow service broke at the end of July, he was not informed that his Department had this information in its possession; that he and his ministerial colleagues were repeatedly allowed out to tell the public they knew nothing of the withdrawal of the service; that news of the decision came as a bolt from the blue for them; and that no one in the Department told him anything about the issue.  Having kept him in the dark about all of this, he now thinks so highly of the Department that he proposes to have it investigate itself on all these matters.The Minister must make a statement on this matter in the House today and Deputies must have an opportunity to question him on it.  The bottom line is that the Department was aware of Aer Lingus's plans on 13 June and the Government had a six-week period within which it could have intervened to prevent the removal of the Heathrow service from Shannon Airport.  In these circumstances, the Labour Party will oppose the proposal, unless the Tánaiste outlines beforehand what arrangements will be made for the Minister to come into the House to respond to these matters.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is essential that the House address this important issue.  Before the decision to privatise Aer Lingus was made, the House was promised a White Paper which would address the strategy implications of privatisation for the country, including in the key area of regional policy.  A White Paper has not been produced.  In addition, we have discovered that the Minister did not appoint representatives to the Aer Lingus board who would convey Government opinion and policy.  Protection against the leasing or switching of the slots at Heathrow Airport was not built in to the process and the vehicles the Government dreamed up to protect regional strategy proved to be unworkable.  We now learn that, six weeks before a decision was made, officials in the Department circulated a note to the airport authority in which they raised this fact and that a second note was prepared either for the former or current Minister.  Who in the Government is in charge if a Minister does not know of an issue of such importance?  It was a core part of the strategy of the Department of Transport and the Minister was not informed.  Huge questions must be asked at some stage in the Dáil today.Apart from the Minister, who knew of this?  Did the retiring Minister know?  Did other Departments know and what did they do about it?  Why were systems not set up from the very start, by Government, to ensure that matters of such tremendous importance to regional strategy were immediately conveyed to Ministers so that effective action could be taken?  It seems that the Government just wanted something to happen, but did not put any policy in place to make it happen.  That is very clear from the notes circulated today.  The departmental note of 13 June acknowledged that Aer Lingus was free to redeploy its slots to new services at the very time Ministers were telling the Dáil that we had a strategy to protect against such.  It is a total shambles.

If the Government seeks to achieve certain policy objectives, it must have an information network to inform it and the policy tools to deliver them.  In this case, the Department had neither.  The Minister, plainly, is not in control of his Department.  This is a serious issue——

There are huge issues of accountability and around the decision-making processes in an organisation where the Government should ensure that strategic infrastructure is delivered, which it has not in this instance.  The impetus for any type of balanced regional development has been lost on foot of what happened so it is crucial that the House is afforded an opportunity to discuss the matter today and the Minister is afforded the courtesy of setting out his case.

I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's offer to agree to special notice questions on the issue raised today.  That was very fair.  However, the Government needs to make time available to deal with this.  While the Minister for Transport will answer questions in the House today, the questions were tabled a week ago before we had possession of the information that his Department knew about this matter in June.

When the Shannon issue broke we were told that the Government knew nothing about it, that the matter was dropped on it by the company and that it could not intervene.  We now know that the line Department knew about this in June and that there was plenty of time to have the matter dealt with, the decision changed and an intervention brought about.There is an area of doubt, though, because if the Department knew about this, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, should have known.

He should come before the House to explain his situation.  A better solution than the Department merely investigating itself on this matter must be arranged because the facts must be established.  The issue should be examined independently by a person who is not a member of the permanent Government club.

In those cases people in the Civil Service fell on their swords.  I insist that there must be political accountability on this matter.  The Minister must come before the House, answer for himself, take questions and take responsibility.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The Ceann Comhairle is correct in offering a Private Notice Question and we accept it as valuable, but this issue is too deep to cover in such a constrained amount of time.  A private notice question offers only half an hour at maximum, which is less than the usual hour that is frequently allowed on questions like this.  On this side of the House there are at least six Deputies with Private Notice Questions and there are serious concerns about issue here.On an issue vital to Government strategy the assistant secretary of a Department rang the chief executive of Aer Lingus and the airport authority but, we are supposed to believe, no contact was made with the Minister, the most influential individual in determining the direction of Government strategy.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Even if one were to believe that, it shows that the Minister had not put in place mechanisms whereby he would be informed in time of issues that are important to his strategy so that he would have the opportunity to act on them.  Regardless of whether we believe that the Minister knew nothing, there must be accountability because, one way or the other, the Minister did not put in place the necessary structures in his Department.  His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, who I hope will also participate in a debate, did not put in place structures in his Department that would allow a core issue to be notified to the top of the Department so that effective action could be taken to deal with it.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the public was sold a pup.  We were led to believe the Government had a strategy when there was none.  This matter cannot be passed over as a routine question as it is a core element of Government strategy.  The Government must step up to the plate, take responsibility and face the debate in this House in a proper manner.

We know that Ministers are not accountable because it has been evident in issues such as e-voting and other debacles, but on this occasion it is important that the Minister come before the House to make a statement with questions to follow.  I support the call for an independent investigation in the Department to find out exactly what happened, to be followed by a published report.

The Minister will be in the House today and it is for the Ceann Comhairle to decide the length of time given to a Private Notice Question.  The Minister is available and anxious to address the matter today and there are two Priority Questions dealing with it.  The Opposition is seeking to manufacture an argument on the matter this morning.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	62	On a point of order, am I correct in saying that it is not for the Ceann Comhairle to order Government business and that it is open to the Government to provide time for the Minister to answer questions in an open debate?  The Minister is hiding behind the Chair and is reneging on his responsibilities.  The Government has the right and the obligation to provide time for this matter but it is too funky to do so.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I hope the Tánaiste has taken on board the strength of feeling on this side of the House with regard to accountability on this important issue and that he will at least use maximum discretion to provide time for a debate on it.  I am sure that by the end of today's session we will still have unanswered questions and that the Dáil will, once again, have been found unable to fulfil its duty and obligation to properly scrutinise Ministers.  I expect that will be the disappointment at the end of today'ssession.Yesterday we heard another Minister describe the position on pensions as unsustainable and state that to do nothing would be disastrous.  Why has that Minister then decided to defer making any decisions on pension legislation?  We were told that after the review, decisions would be made on such legislation.  The previous incumbent, Deputy Brennan, expressed the clear view that a one-for-one system should be proceeded with, but now the decision has yet again been deferred.  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance move to bring forward, at least, the one-for-one proposal made by the previous Minister as a way of moving forward in a practical way.  The Minister must not continue with the charade of continuous consultation which, in the case of issues such as public transport regulation, has left us without a decision for decades.

This is a matter of complexity and importance which looks to the long-term financial, economic and social sustainability of the pension system.  It must take into account many factors, including the actuarial review that has taken place with regard to the PRSI system.  A number of major documents were published and placed in the public domain yesterday for discussion by the many interested parties involved.  The Minister has indicated that it will take until the middle of next year for that informed discussion to take place.  It is important we get it right because of the significant implications.  Making wrong decisions would have serious implications, not just in the immediate future for our finances, but also in the long term.  People should first consider and absorb the important work that resulted in the publication of the Green Paper.  We must look at all the options and measures for consideration before deciding on the direction we should take.  It is about a strategy for the long term, not the next two, three or four years.  While successful initiatives were brought forward which increased the savings ratio in the economy and reintroduced a culture of saving to this generation in a way not envisaged before their success, the Opposition did not agree with some of them and suggested some had not been properly set up.  However, they proved very successful.  Rather than seeking immediate decisions on the publication of a Green Paper, it would be better if everyone internalised and debated the matter.  We would then have a better prospect of coming to the right strategic decisions in due course.

One of the committees proposed to be established by the Government is a transport committee.  The Labour Party intends to propose to that committee that the Ministers currently and previously in the Department of Transport on 13 June, as well as their officials, be invited to attend and outline their knowledge of the matters relating to Shannon and answer questions.  Will the Government agree to this proposal?I understand the constituency commission which deals with Dáil and European election constituency boundaries is due to report to the Ceann Comhairle before the end of this month.  When does he expect to receive that report?

It seems clear from Deputy Gilmore's statement that he has made up his mind on these matters already and sees an opportunity in so doing.  The Minister is anxious to come into the House to explain the position in respect of the matter not brought to his attention but which everyone agrees should have been.Substantive work on the electoral amendment Bill will commence when the commission report is available.  That report has not yet been received.

That was the position until 2002.  Am I to take it that in the context of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, having given this House misleading information about the knowledge within his Department of what was happening in Shannon——

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the Irish Council for Civil Liberties this summer that the Government would not be proceeding with that Bill yet the legislative programme states the heads have been agreed.  There are strong grounds for concern about the Bill, a Cheann Comhairle——

That business has not been well cleared up by the Government.  In fact, things are getting fishier.  On 12 October a statutory instrument was published, this is secondary legislation, in the name of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  On 16 October a statutory instrument was published, secondary legislation, in the name of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.

This is about the way the Government manages its affairs and how the public can relate to the Government.  It appears we now have two different Departments that have been declared as responsible for statutory instruments in Iris Oifigiúil.  That is untenable.  The Tánaiste might treat this matter with a little more respect.  What is the position?  Who is responsible for the marine?  What is the name of the Department and how will that issue be addressed?

I raised the issue of country of origin labelling and the Taoiseach said no such legislation was promised yet it is mentioned in the programme for Government and in a press release issued by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food this week.

The practice has developed now where, during the week, Ministers who are not keeping their eye on the ball are putting down motions for debate which they expect to be rubber-stamped in the Chamber without any notice.  No. 8c on today’s Order Paper has been on the Minister’s desk since 25 July but it must be dealt with today as a matter of urgency.

Who will deal with management companies in the future?  It is listed for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but I understand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as he should, will take an interest in this issue.  Thousands of people are now living in homes subject to very high management company charges, perhaps not in Kerry, a Cheann Comhairle, but in Dublin West people are paying €2,000 a year to have a little bush clipped at the front of their house.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	139	As you are aware, Sir, Article 35.4 of the Constitution gives absolute power to this House and the other House to remove a Supreme Court or a High Court judge on the basis of stated misbehaviour of incapacity.  Given the circumstances of the case that came to public attention last year, and the Curtin case, and the view of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which is five years established, that we should implement legislation surrounding that article in the Constitution, has the Government plans to introduce legislation on foot of the unanimous view of both sides of the House that we must deal with this issue sooner rather than later?  We faced this issue before and we are likely to face it again.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	141	There are draft heads of a judicial council Bill, the purpose of which is to provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour including lay participation in the investigation of the complaints, in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The draft heads, taking into account the work done by the Constitution Review Group, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the Chief Justice's committee on judicial ethics are the subject of certain consultations at present.  That is where the work referred to by the Deputy now rests.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Can the Minister spell out the requirements being imposed in the Bill on non-deposit taking institutions?  How do they compare with the list of requirements imposed on normal financial institutions which take deposits?  Which requirements on that list are being applied and what are not being applied to non-deposit taking institutions?  It is important that we have clarity as to the level of prudential supervision, authorisation and so on.  The amendment lists seven requirements, listed (a) to (g) in section 31A, to be inserted after section 31 of the Central Bank Act 1997.  What other powers that would normally be applied to a financial institution taking deposits are not being applied to these?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The regulatory requirements of retail credit and home reversion firms are different from those for bureau de change or money transmission businesses, particularly in relation to consumer protection and competency.  As a result, the Financial Regulator may need to impose conditions or requirements on authorised firms which are not explicitly provided for in the 1997 Act.  Accordingly, the amendment adds four new sections to that Act to deal with these concerns.  All of these sections are based on provisions in other legislation, such as the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.Section 31A sets out in some detail the criteria which a firm will have to satisfy in order to obtain or retain authorisation.  Section 32A enables the Financial Regulator to grant different classes of authorisations by reference to the business actually carried out, to conduct a thorough investigation of applicants and to have regard to any relevant supervisory requirement imposed on the firm or applicant in another EEA country.Section 33A empowers the Financial Regulator to impose requirements on authorised firms in the interest of consumer protection and orderly regulation.  It includes powers to oblige firms to provide specific information in relation to consumer credit and home reversion agreements and to extend the consumer protection code to retail credit and home reversion firms.Section 34C covers commencement and transition.  Firms currently engaged in retail credit and home reversion business will be taken to be authorised, provided they apply to the Financial Regulator within three months.  The regulator will be empowered to impose conditions on them, or direct a temporary suspension of business if necessary.  Many of these firms have actively sought regulation and claim to abide by the consumer protection code.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19940	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Minister is not answering my question.  What restrictions or regulations would apply to a deposit taking institution which are not being applied here?  I am thinking, for example, of liquidity ratios, the type of financial instruments they buy and process and the prudential requirements of these institutions.  The recent crisis was precipitated by the fact that many unregulated bodies, some of which this Bill proposes to regulate, have been engaged in practices which have generated contagion throughout the financial system.  It is important that the House knows what restrictions could be applied which we have decided not to apply.  What regulations which would apply to a bank are not being applied in the Bill and why is it limited to the areas cited by the Minister, that is, criteria for authorisation, conditions on the authorisation and some requirements relating to consumer protection?  The Bill applies a limited form of supervision.  Why has the Minister chosen a particular point on the spectrum of supervision and what is being left out?  We should at least consider the possibility of prudential regulation being part of the Bill.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Because they are not taking money from the public and do not have deposits, prudential issues do not arise.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Those companies were subject to regulation.  The problem arose from the particular model they were utilising at a time when the inter-bank markets became illliquid.  In a situation such as Deputy Bruton cites, the fundamental business of a bank remains in operation, it continues to do business and can trade its way out of difficulties.  It was the failure to have access to funds, based on the model they were using, rather than any fundamental reason that caused the recent problem.  There was not a business failure.  There was no question of people being left out of funds.  Where there is such an aggressive model, a financial regulator — as in the recent case in the UK — needs to know exactly what the situation is and whether a problem could be overcome if one arose.  The turbulence in financial markets which caused the recent problem was so swift and widespread that it caused an unforeseeable situation to develop.  That is a separate issue.  The prudential question does not arise in that respect.This section gives the Financial Regulator the necessary power to enable him to deal with any situation which might arise, although not in operations which take deposits from the public.  That is the general point being made.  These provisions are drawn from the experience of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 etcetera.  The Financial Regulator is being provided with the means by which he can deal with these matters.  The fact that they come under the regulatory framework and must, therefore, come under the consumer protection code and have authorisations and registrations means the Financial Regulator can, in coming to his decisions, obtain the information he needs to satisfy himself that these are entities which should be authorised on the basis they have a reputable business model to pursue.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	152	Following on from Deputy Bruton's questions I wish to raise a number of issues with the Minister.  I do not understand how the Minister is minded to approach the issue of regulation.  He refers to these firms being non-deposit taking institutions as the reason they were not included in regulation when the law was first introduced.  The Minister, from what I detected in his speech, appears to believe they are a different type of financial institution because they are non-deposit takers.  I do not know, from what the Minister said, whether this view is based on advice he has received from the regulator or on the Central Bank's view of non-deposit taking institutions.  We, on the Opposition side, are trying to point out to the Minister that although they may be non-deposit taking institutions and, therefore, not a traditional bank, the consequences for the people who use their products are the same — perhaps more severe — as would apply if they defaulted a loan, mortgage or some other financial product obtained from any of the high street banks.A person who does not have regular dealings with other financial institutions or a person with a bad credit record — traditionally the type of person these institutions attack — will not know the bank with which they are dealing is a non-deposit taking institution that is not subject to the collective regulation to which other banks are traditionally subjected.I want to come back to a point I made last night as it relates to a number of cases with which I have dealt as a constituency Deputy.  An enormous barrage of advertising in respect of home reversion products is directed at older people in particular and encourages them to borrow on the strength of equity in their home based on the loan not having to be repaid until some time later or following their death.  An issue arises in respect of solicitors advising older people buying into these products which involves their family homes.  The Minister did not make clear in the advice he gave yesterday whether the concept of family home extends to the inclusion of a family business and, in particular, a family farm.  What people need is a good solicitor, in terms of advice, more than a good accountant.  These products are constantly advertised on radio and television as being tremendously attractive.The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Mr. Ben Bernanke, when speaking about these institutions referred to the dubious practice of loans being granted to people who are unable to pay them.  As I said yesterday, it is not the Minister's role to save people from themselves.  However, financial products which are so risky that the chance of substantial numbers of people defaulting on mortgage repayments is high can result in many sad stories.  The Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank referred to loan applications being stress-tested.  In other words, checks are made to ensure the information given by applicants is honest, reasonable and fairly reliable.  People laugh when they hear this as it has become the custom and practice in some banking circles — this is particularly true in respect of some of the newer lenders — to take the most optimistic view, to put it charitably, of what people can repay.  A person who owns a local authority house or recently purchased an affordable house can remortgage that property when its value increases.Will the Minister expand on his definition in this regard?  He stated that the Financial Regulator told him this is all the power he requires.  Is this correct?  Has the Financial Regulator sent submissions on this to the Minister?  This new form of banking, which is the cause of the current turmoil in the financial markets, was warned about for three years in the United States.  It has suffered enormously as a result, including a potential economic recession.  The consequences of this for individuals and the economy are fairly startling.Why can the Minister not be more specific in terms of how he describes these products?  Also, why does he hold the view that as non-deposit taking institutions they are somehow or other not a bank?  The Minister should remember that these products when sold are bundled together at the end of the week or month and sold on to other financial institutions which are deposit takers.  These people make their money by selling a product, obtaining the fees on the sale and then bundling them and selling them on.  Ormond Quay ended up with a great deal of worthless paper rather than solid investments because it bought bundles of such products.  The Minister's approach to this is critical to the Irish market and the IFSC.  I hope he can clarify this issue.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I wish to make a couple of observations on this section.  On prudential measures, the Minister makes the point that these institutions are non-deposit takers.  However, the subprime market is high risk.  The Bill refers to the competency and organisational approach of the various institutions in the subprime market.  Inherent in this should be the requirement to have sound financial backup.  Those who do not have this backup will take more risks.  Some of these institutions are currently lending at rates of upwards of 9% making it impossible for people to repay the loans.It is critical that any institution operating in the subprime market is of good financial standing.  The only way the Government and regulator can ensure this is the case is to put in place prudential  measures.  I do not believe it is possible to operate regulation in respect of non-deposit institutions without putting in place the required prudential measures.I note that subprime lenders wishing to operate here will be required to apply for a licence within three months of the enactment of this legislation.  How long will they be permitted to continue if they have not been granted a licence?  Could it be for one year?  These are important points.The Minister spoke about retail credit firms and stated that the consumer protection code applies only to people with a turnover of up to €3 million.  A business which starts out with a relatively low turnover could, within a relatively short period, increase its turnover to, say, €2.9 million and remain covered by the consumer protection code.  However, if that turnover increases to €3.1 million the person will no longer be covered.  Perhaps the Minister will consider looking at this again with a view to raising that limit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I explained in my initial contribution that this section deals with the introduction of further legislative arrangements to cover these firms in respect of home reversion products and so on.  We are adding to what is already provided for under Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997.  Part V already provides the framework for the supervision of regulated businesses and applies to bureaux de change and money transmitters.  The amendments will add home reversion and retail credit to the activities regulated under Part V by including them in the definition of regulated business, which they have not been up to now.  We cover that point by defining home reversion and retail credit firms in the Bill.The definitions of credit and some of the components of credit are also included as they are needed to support the definitions of retail credit firms and are based on existing statutory definitions or EU directives.  For the purpose of regulation, a retail credit firm is defined as one which is not already regulated as a bank or other authorised lender and is in the business of making loans to persons who would fall within the protection offered by the consumer protection code if dealing with a regulated financial service provider.Home reversion schemes involve the sale of a share in real property, usually a residence, which can only be realised by the purchaser on the death or vacation of the property by the vendor.  Though not strictly speaking a credit product, they have a similar effect to equity release or lifetime mortgages and are offered by some of the same providers to a similar clientele so they should be subject to similar regulation.  The regulatory requirements of retail credit and home reversion firms are different from those for bureaux de change or money transmission businesses, particularly in the area of consumer protection and competency.  As a result, the Financial Regulator may impose conditions or requirements on authorised firms which are not explicitly provided for in the 1997 Act in respect of all the other regulated businesses so we are adding to the regulatory provisions, not just with Part V in respect of these operations, but with further requirements that can be imposed by the Financial Regulator, if necessary.  That means adding four new sections to the Central Bank Act 1997 to deal with these concerns.  Far from there being a reduced regulatory burden the Bill will provide more ammunition because the products and firms in question, which were previously outside the regulatory framework, are now inside where they can be dealt with accordingly.The four new sections to which I referred are based on provisions in other legislation, such as the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995.  I have referred on previous occasions to the extra flexibility and power these provisions give the Financial Regulator.  For example, the regulator can grant different classes of authorisation, conduct a thorough investigation of applicants, set out in some detail the criteria a firm will have to satisfy to obtain or retain authorisation and have regard to the relevant supervisory requirement imposed on the firm.  Other sections enable the Financial Regulator to impose requirements in the interests of consumer protection and orderly regulation, including powers to oblige firms to provide specific information in respect of consumer credit and home reversion agreements and to extend the consumer protection code to retail credit and home reversion firms.We are making every effort to ensure these firms come under the regulatory regime in an effective way and to give the Financial Regulator the powers by which it can deal with issues as they arise so that when firms obtain regulatory approvals and authorisations they do so in a way that best ensures they conduct their business in accordance with the consumer protection codes that are in place.The application of the consumer protection code will strengthen the initial relationship of due care and diligence.  If securitisation or other funding mechanisms operated by a regulated retail credit firm are likely to adversely affect the consumer or the orderly conduct of financial service business, the provisions of the 1997 Act, together with the amendments now being introduced in this Bill, will enable the Financial Regulator to deal with them.  I assume that is the concern which Deputies have with regard to the section.Deputy Burton said that regulation needed to apply to lending offered to sectors such as farming and the definitions of "credit" and of "retail credit firm" are sufficient to capture this.  Following the amendment, farmers and other unincorporated traders will be covered by the consumer protection code and the Financial Services Ombudsman scheme in their dealings with non-deposit-taking lenders, as they are in their dealings with all other regulated financial service providers.The consumer protection code sets down both general principles and detailed rules in respect of the conduct of business by financial institutions.  Its principles require such institutions to act fairly, honestly and professionally in the best interests of customers.  Detailed rules cover matters such as advertising, identifying customers' needs and providing information.  The Financial Regulator can investigate breaches of the code and impose sanctions under Part III of the Central Bank Act 1997 for any such breaches.  The process of authorisation means that retail credit firms and home reversion firms will become, as I said, regulated financial service providers for the purposes of the code and therefore come within the umbrella of regulatory supervision which we believe to be in the public interest.  We are trying in this Bill to provide the necessary regulation in view of matters which have occurred elsewhere, though they are not germane to this country.

The bodies to which the Minister refers have three months to apply for authorisation.  Is there any time limit for the Financial Regulator to make a decision either to grant or refuse authorisation?  There should be a maximum time limit by which decisions will be made.  The Minister seems to be suggesting that firms must apply within three months and wait for a decision but there should be a time limit on the Financial Regulator to make a decision.

I can obtain the details and let the Deputy know in writing.

There is a three-month time limit for notifying the President of the Council of our wish to take part in the adoption and application of any such measures and as this proposal was presented to the Council on 25 July 2007, if Ireland wishes to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument from the beginning, it has until 24 October 2007 to inform Council of its intentions.At its meeting on Tuesday of this week the Government agreed that Ireland should exercise the option provided by Article 3 of the fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam to notify the President of the Council of the European Union that it wishes to take part in the negotiation of the proposed Council regulation on the extension of the provisions of Regulation 883/2004 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by these provisions solely on the ground of their nationality.  The exercise by the State of any such option is, under the Constitution, also subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The regulations co-ordinate social security systems within the EU and are designed to remove obstacles to freedom of movement which would otherwise arise from loss or reduction of social security cover or entitlements when a person moves from one country to another.Since the adoption of Regulation 859/2003, which was approved by the Government and by the Oireachtas in March 2002 and came into force on 1 June 2003, third country nationals who have worked in two or more member states and their family members and survivors can rely on Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 on the same basis as EU nationals, provided they are legally resident in the territory of an EU member state.  A third country national, therefore, who becomes unemployed having worked legally in the UK and Ireland can rely on an aggregation of social insurance paid in both states to qualify for jobseeker's benefit.The current Commission proposal aims to extend to third country nationals the provisions of Regulation (EC) 883/2004. This regulation will replace the existing Regulation 1408/71.  However, the scope of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 is wider than Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 in that the former also covers persons who are not professionally active, not just workers as heretofore but all legally resident third country nationals.There are a number of reasons it is considered that the State should respond positively to this proposal.  First, the conference which adopted the Amsterdam treaty amendments took note of the declaration by Ireland that it intended to exercise its right under Article 3 of the protocol on the position of the UK and Ireland to take part in the adoption of measures under Title IV of the treaty establishing the European Union to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the common travel area with the UK.The proposal is also in keeping with the spirit of conclusions of the 1999 Tampere European Council, in which Heads of State stressed that member states must ensure fair treatment of non-EU nationals who reside legally on their territory.  This includes better integration of third country nationals who are legally resident in the territory of a member state by giving them rights that are as close as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens.  This position was echoed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in 2005.  The extension of the EU regulations on social security to third country nationals is an important means of achieving these EU policy goals.  Ireland supported the extension of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 to third country nationals on the basis that this extension was fully in line with national policy. Therefore, to continue this policy we should support the current proposal from the Commission.Additionally, as there are no nationality conditions in Irish social security legislation, people who are legally resident here and who take up or are entitled to take up work in Ireland have the same social welfare entitlements as Irish nationals.  I want also to emphasise that these extended rules do not give entitlement to third country nationals to enter, stay or reside in a member state or to have access to its labour markets.Third country nationals who are covered by these provisions must be legally resident on the territory of a member state and therefore must have a temporary or permanent right of residence.  Movement to another member state must be in compliance with the second state's national legislation on entry and residence.   While I am satisfied that the purpose of the current proposal is to extend social security protection to non-active third country nationals on the same basis as non-active EU nationals, Ireland would be keen to partake in the discussions of this proposal to ensure that Ireland's existing conditions for such payments would apply.  It is important that Ireland is in a position to influence the negotiations on the proposal.Given that certain third country nationals already enjoy protection of social security rights, it is considered that the fact that the scope of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 also covers people who are not professionally active will not have a significant impact on the burden borne by member states as the number of persons who will be covered over and above the current situation will be low.  Like Ireland, the UK opted into the extension of Regulations 1408/71 and  574/72 to third country nationals but it is not known at this stage what the UK intends to do in regard to the current proposal.  Should the UK not opt in, it is considered that this will have no implications for the common travel area as both the UK and Ireland would continue to operate their existing immigration controls in regard to third country nationals and the proposal does not confer any new entitlement of residence.For the reasons I have outlined, I recommend the motion to the House.

The Minister thanked all sides of the House for the opportunity to bring this motion forward.  The Fine Gael Party did not want to prevent this happening because of the timescales involved.The proposal was presented to the Council on 25 July 2007, with a three-month timeframe for Ireland to notify the Council if it wished to take part in the negotiations.  This is the fourth week of the Dáil term and it is disappointing the proposal was discussed at Cabinet only last Tuesday when effectively, the last day it could come before the House would be next Tuesday.  We were notified after 9.30 p.m. on Tuesday last that this motion would be discussed today.  That notice is inadequate to tease out the intricacies of a proposal, that could have important consequences.I support the proposal for better integration of third country nationals who are already legally resident in the European Union.  Does the Minister have statistics on the number of people who will fall under this measure, on a temporary and permanent basis?  I accept the figure can change over time, but were the regulation to be enacted in the next year, what is the likely number?  Extending the provisions of the EC regulation will have cost implications.  The Minister will understand that I do not have much faith in Government statistics on non-EU nationals given its appalling inability to calculate the numbers in the recent past, for example on the social welfare early childhood supplement.  I think the Government did not realise it would have to be paid to non-nationals.  At one point we were told by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs that it would cost €10 million.  The Department of Health and Children also had a figure of €10 million, but the Taoiseach originally said it would cost €1 million, but at this point it has cost upwards of €10 million.  I appreciate that the introduction of the early childhood supplement was a Government proposal that had been suggested by the Fine Gael Party in advance of the Government's announcement.  We need accurate figures on the numbers that will fall under this measure.The briefing note on this motion states the Government is looking for consent to take part in the negotiations and further states that it wishes to take part in the adoption and application of the instrument.  Does that mean the Government proposes putting forward changes in the instrument to date?  Is there room for negotiation?The Minister may have seen reports on the social insurance fund, in particular a report by Mercer Consultants to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs which states that PRSI contributions will not be enough to pay for welfare benefits in three years time, at which point the system will face huge deficits.  What impact will these proposals have on the social welfare system?  This brings us back to the numbers who will be eligible to be paid from social welfare, which is under quite a degree of pressure.I support the motion, but questions need to be answered on it.  While I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, does not have ultimate responsibility for this, he is representing the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and I hope he can answer some of these questions when concluding.

I thank the Minister's officials for providing a briefing document for the Opposition spokespersons.  However, why have we had such late notice on this proposal?  The decision to approve the Council regulation was made at European level on 25 July last and I think the Minister owes us an explanation as to why at the last minute and with very short notice we have been told about it.  Quite clearly the Dáil schedule of business did not include time for this matter.  Why did it occur to somebody only at a late stage that this issue needed to be dealt with before 24 October?  I notice also from the briefing document that the matter was brought to Cabinet just this week.  Again, given that the Department knew about this since last July, why was it so late in being brought to Cabinet and subsequently being brought to this House?  We are entitled to an explanation.  Too often different proposals are sprung on us.  Very little time is provided to examine them in any kind of detail.  While nobody wants to hold up an important provision such as this, there is an issue as to whether we are doing business professionally and properly and the extent to which we can consider or examine the proposals put before us.  It is unfair of the Government to put the Opposition in a position where there is inadequate time to consider the proposal.Will the Minister provide a detailed explanation in his concluding remarks as to why it has taken over three months to bring this proposal to Cabinet and subsequently to the Dail?The proposal is undoubtedly welcome.  It ensures that third country nationals working in more than one EU state can combine social welfare contributions made in those states in order to claim social security benefits.  That is a good thing.  Up until the turn of the century, EU immigration policy was very much dominated by the security side of the issue.  The social and welfare aspects of immigration policy, that is the rights and entitlements of legitimate workers from outside the EU, were much less developed.  That mirrored a situation across the EU institutions whereby welfare type policies were very slow to develop.  This strikes at the heart, purpose and legitimacy of the EU.  If it is ever to serve its citizens, the EU must be much more than just a common market.  The fact that we are opting into this proposal suggests we have still quite a long way to go in terms of welfare provision.  It is welcome nonetheless and the Labour Party is happy to support this proposal.There is a general need for more legal protections for immigrant workers.  Obviously this reform will be useless to employees, if unscrupulous employers do not pay PRSI contributions for them.  One suspects that third country nationals are more vulnerable than EU nationals in this regard.  Last year only six fraud cases taken against employers resulted in a fine.  It is very hard to know why that is the case.  I am not sure if this reflects how small the problem is or how inactive the Department is, but clearly there must be rigorous enforcement of the law against errant employers if the proposal before us is to have any real meaning.  On the basis of anecdotal evidence, there would seem to be a serious problem of non-nationals, whether from the EU or outside the EU, working in the black economy.  That fuels much of the racism in Ireland because Irish workers see non-nationals working for low wages, driving down wages generally and undercutting them.  Much of the evidence of this is anecdotal but there seems to be something to it.It is extraordinary that last year there were only six cases in which fines were levied against employers who were not living up to their commitments.  Until recently, the number of labour inspectors was so low, there was a sense of a free-for-all for employers.  This opened the gates for widespread abuse with few attempts made by Government to provide an adequate inspectorate to ensure employers were adhering to the law.  There is a long way to go and while it is welcome that people are coming in from the EU and elsewhere, because our economy depends on them, it is essential that the law is applied to employers and that they are obliged to keep to their commitments in terms of safeguards for their workers, regardless of whether they are Irish.  I am not convinced that the current system ensures that happens.I noticed from the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that there is a high rate of fraud and overpayment of child benefit among non-national recipients.  The Minister may be aware that a survey conducted by his Department revealed a fraud rate of 14% among non-nationals whereas the Irish rate was 2.6%.  This resulted in a combined liability of €31.6 million, a considerable sum.  The Department has indicated that steps are being taken to address the problem but, clearly, given the proposal before us, it is important to eradicate these problems before we extend entitlement further.  We certainly do not want to be seen as the soft touch of Europe.  Fraud on this scale going undetected, that we only found out about because the Comptroller and Auditor General has been doing his job so well, leads to a lack of confidence in the system.  The Minister is obliged to ensure the system is robust and that it cannot be defrauded.  A fraud rate of 14% is worrying.I agree with the comments of the previous speaker on the social insurance fund but wider issues arise.  The actuarial review of the social insurance fund was published yesterday and it presents a worrying scenario in respect of the future of social insurance.  In three years' time, our expenditure on social welfare will exceed contribution income.  It goes from a minor discrepancy in 2011 to a considerable shortfall over the following 30 years.  Those are serious findings for the future of social welfare provision in this country.In light of that review and those projects, we must ask how and why Fianna Fáil gave an undertaking to voters before the election that it would reduce the level of PRSI contribution from 4% to 2%.  Fianna Fáil knew at that point the problems the social insurance fund faced but it blatantly defrauded the electorate by promising to reduce the level of PRSI contributions.  That is a serious matter on which we are entitled to a response from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Taoiseach.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on a European Council regulation on social security.  Across the EU there has been a drift away from assisting those in need at the fringes of society.  Regardless of our massive wealth, there are still pockets of serious social and educational disadvantage.  When we look at the social security system, it is appropriate to have this debate.  Just because many people are doing well in a vibrant economy does not mean everyone is moving on.  Every Member of the Oireachtas has a responsibility to ensure the bottom 20% of Irish society is given a leg up.One of the most important strategies to achieve this is the use of social security policy.  The regulations co-ordinate social security systems within the EU and are designed to remove obstacles to freedom of movement which otherwise arise from loss or reduction of social security cover or entitlements when a person moves from one country to another.Since the adoption of Regulation 859/2003, third country nationals who have worked in two or more member states, and their family members and survivors, can rely on Regulation 1408/71 on the same basis as EU nationals provided they are legally resident in the territory of an EU members state.  Therefore, a third country national, for example, who becomes unemployed having worked legally in Ireland, can rely on the aggregation of social insurance paid there and in another state to quality for job seeker's benefit.  We must support those who find themselves unemployed, not just Irish people but everyone who has contributed to the economy.  Those countries in the west with strong economies also have an international responsibility to distribute wealth to poorer countries.  This is a national, European and international issue.The current Commission proposal aims to extend to third country nationals the provisions of the regulation.  The current proposal pursues the same objective as Regulation 859/2003.  The scope of Regulation 883/2004 is wider than Regulation 1408/71 in that the former also covers persons who are non-active, not just workers as heretofore, and legally resident third country nationals.The legal basis for this regulation allows the Council to adopt measures to uphold the rights and conditions of nationals of third countries who are legally resident in a member state to reside in other member states.  We have a moral, political and international responsibility to ensure that people in all European countries receive the relevant social support to which they are entitled.  We should heed all viewpoints in this most important debate.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I thank the Opposition spokespersons and Deputy Finian McGrath for their contributions and the interest they have shown in this matter.  I also thank them for agreeing to take this motion today.I wish to clarify, as I have been requested to do, that this proposal was published at the end of July.  In administrative terms, Europe closes down in August and we did not return here until the end of September.  The Minister would like to have given more time for debate but this was not possible as the Department of Social and Family Affairs had to consult with other Departments.  As a result, the Government decided on this matter last Tuesday, which necessitated its passage by both Houses of the Oireachtas this week.  We are obliged to report to the President of the Council by next Wednesday, 24 October 2007, which explains this measure's swift passage through the House.  While I am willing to apologise for this, the timescale did not permit a longer consideration of the motion.  Although it is not a fait accompli, this Commission proposal ensures that we are in a position to participate in any negotiations.  As Members know, it could take some time before the proposal is finally decided upon by the Council.At this stage, it is hard to quantify how many people will benefit from the measure.  Given that certain people are already covered by these EU regulations — including stateless persons, refugees and third country nationals who have already worked in at least two member states — it is considered that the numbers over and above these will be relatively low.  Consequently, it is expected that the costs will be minimal.The Government has a responsibility to support the social insurance funds by contributions from the Exchequer if there is a deficit from time to time.  It is suggested that there could be such a deficit in a number of years and, if so, those who have contributed to social welfare insurance over the years have no need to be apprehensive because the Government must provide the deficit from the Exchequer.  As with the Green Paper, we must take time to digest the report to which Deputies have referred before coming up with a response.

If people have any worries about the deficit, they will see from the report of five years ago that it is by and large the same.I am somewhat alarmed, as is the Minister, by the high rate of 40% which was referred to, together with the 2.6% from Irish nationals costing some €36.1 million.  It is alarmingly high.  The Minister, Deputy Cullen, is unavoidably absent this morning but he will be taking the motion in the Seanad.  He is anxious to try to curb this as much as possible.We will be a party to the negotiations on this proposal and will play an important role as we do in all aspects of European legislation, regulations and directives.  This motion provides us with an opportunity to do that.  I thank the House for its co-operation in this matter.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I move: "That Second Stage be taken now."
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The purpose of the Passports Bill is to provide a comprehensive legislative basis for the regulation and issuance of passports.  Over recent years, we have seen a rapid growth in international travel and a corresponding increase in demand for passports.  More than 630,000 Irish passports were issued last year, compared with 468,000 in 2003 and 388,000 in 2000.  Irish people made 7 million visits overseas in 2006.The growth in demand, advances in technology and changes in international security requirements have necessitated substantial reform and modernisation of the passport system.  Major innovations completed in recent years have included the introduction of machine readable passports, the development of an automated production facility and, in 2006, the introduction of biometric passports.  As a result of these improvements, the Irish passport is widely seen as a high quality document, which is at the leading edge of passport technology internationally.Over a relatively short period of time, we have moved a long way.  Improvements in quality have been accompanied by a strong record on customer service.  For many years, the Department of Foreign Affairs has successfully delivered a ten working day service for applications made through the express postal services, both north and south of the Border.  Where applicants are required to travel within a shorter timeframe, it is possible to secure a passport more quickly; a limited same-day or next-day service is also available in the most urgent cases.Whereas reform of the passport system has focused primarily on technology and the quality of service delivery, there is a need to reform the underlying regulatory framework.  Passports are currently issued under general administrative provisions set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  Various administrative practices have been developed over the years and it is time to put in place specific legislation to bring greater clarity and certainty to the area.We live in a country which is very different to that of the 1920s.  Practices concerning the issuance of passports have evolved over time to reflect changes in society and these practices need to be set down clearly in legislation.  The Bill therefore includes provisions that address the consent of parents who are living apart.  It sets out in detail provisions for issuing passports in accordance with names on birth certificates, whether in Irish or English, and caters for the recognition of subsequent changes of names whether after marriage or through established usage.  It also makes provision for issuance of passports to persons who are undergoing or have undergone changes of gender.There is no desire on the part of the Minister to change social policy, which is rightly the prerogative of the relevant Ministers.  There is, however, an onus on the Minister and the Department to provide the appropriate arrangements so that Irish citizens can travel abroad freely and with dignity.The courts have established that there is a constitutional right to travel and, by implication, a right to obtain a passport.  That right is not unqualified and there are certain circumstances in which a passport may validly be withheld, including cases where an individual is subject to a court order under the Bail Act 1997.Particular care is also required in regard to the welfare of children.  The Bill ensures that the welfare of the child is at the centre of our considerations and it includes detailed provisions on consent of parents and guardians.  A second principal objective of the Bill is to combat fraud and misuse of passports.  Since the attacks on the World Trade Centre in September 2001, there has been increased international emphasis on improving identity and passport security.  The investment in biometric passports has substantially improved the security of the Irish passport.  This needs to be complemented, however, by strengthening measures to tackle fraudulent applications for, and misuse of, Irish passports.As the law stands, criminal offences concerning the abuse of passports are general offences relating to property and range across several Acts.  The case of the Colombia three highlighted the need for specific legislation to cover passport offences.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for a detailed series of offences and penalties for the fraudulent acquisition, misuse and abuse of passports.  The Bill will also enable prosecution of such offences where committed outside the State.  This section was drafted in close co-operation with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions,Combating fraudulent use of Irish passports is important to ensure continued respect internationally for the integrity of the document.  Organised criminals have developed increasingly sophisticated methods to carry out their activities.  Moreover, crime does not respect borders and greater freedom of movement, particularly within the expanded European Union, means that all member states have a responsibility to strengthen systems which will detect and prevent misuse of national travel and identity documents.To guard against fraud it is necessary to require applicants to produce adequate evidence of their identity and their entitlement to an Irish passport.  This in turn means the Department acquires a considerable volume of personal data.  The Department is subject to, and complies fully with the Data Protection Act 1988.  Nevertheless, to ensure that individuals' personal rights in this regard are fully respected, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have consulted closely with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in drafting the Bill.  I am grateful to them and to other bodies such as the Irish Human Rights Commission, for their advice and input.In preparing the Bill, the Minister adopted an approach which is respectful of the rights of Irish citizens while bringing in the necessary sanctions against those who would endanger the integrity of our passport.  Less secure travel documents would adversely affect our citizens as they travel.Sections 1 to 4 under Part 1 are standard provisions relating respectively, to the short title and commencement date; definitions of terms; provision to make regulations under the legislation and expenses incurred in the administration of the legislation.  The long title draws on the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s, ICAO, definition of a passport as an international travel document which designates a person’s citizenship.Section 5 provides that the Minister’s functions under the legislation are performed on the authority of the Government. Section 6 provides for the right of an Irish citizen to apply for a passport and outlines the application process.  Subsections (3) and (4) deal respectively with applications regarding children and persons with a physical or mental incapacity.  Section 14 contains more detailed provisions regarding consent of parents and or guardians.Section 7 requires that before issuing a passport, the Minister shall be satisfied as to the Irish citizenship and identity of an applicant.  Citizenship may be acquired in various ways: most commonly through birth, through a parent or grandparent, or through naturalisation.  In some circumstances, it is also necessary to establish minimum periods of lawful residency in the State.  This is a complex area and the nature of the documentation required will vary depending on individual circumstances.The requirement to be satisfied as to a person's identity relates to the risk of identity theft.  The introduction of biometric passports last year was designed as an additional safeguard and will over time reduce substantially the scope for fraud.  We continually seek ways to tackle identity theft.  Consultations will be held with the General Registrar's Office regarding the possible introduction of a link between birth and death certificates.  Training has been provided regarding identification of forged documentation.  Following a review of documentation submitted, if doubts remain as to an individual's identity, current practice is to request the applicant to submit additional documentation or, on occasion, attend for interview. Section 7 provides the legal basis for continuation of these practices.  The Minister intends to strengthen this area of the passport service by establishing a specific unit dedicated solely to detecting and combating fraud.  The provision under sections 19 through 24 of the Bill will further strengthen efforts to combat fraud.Section 8 provides for the processing of personal data, including biometric data, in connection with passport applications.  Biometric technology makes use of our unique biological features.  Examples of biometric identifiers include facial measurements and characteristics, fingerprints and iris patterns.  The Irish passport uses facial measurements and characteristics.  This allows for the comparison of photographs when one renews one’s passport.  It also allows for comparisons at border control points to ensure that the person travelling is the real owner of the passport.The Passport Office stores the photographs and the biometric information taken from them securely.  The information will be used only for passport purposes and will not be shared with other agencies, except as may be required by law.  The Passport Office can generate facial measurements from a photograph.  Although there are no plans to include a second biometric identifier such as fingerprints or iris patterns, there is a possibility that this may become standard international practice at some point in the future and cannot be ruled out.  Accordingly, subsection (2) provides for the possibility of contractual arrangements with a third party to collect this information from applicants at authorised centres around the country or at locations abroad.  We have consulted closely with the office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding relevant provisions in the Bill, including section 8.Section 9 deals with periods of validity of passports.  This is intended to underpin existing practice where the period of validity may vary according to age or other circumstances.  Most passports issued are valid for ten years.  Passports for children are valid for three or five years, depending on the age of the child because a child’s appearance changes substantially over time.The Department may issue emergency passports in circumstances where an applicant is required to travel at short notice and there is insufficient time to enable production of a full passport.  Such passports are valid for one year.  The period of validity for diplomatic or official passports also varies depending, for example, on the likely duration of an officer's assignment to an embassy or consulate overseas.  Subsection (2) also provides for passports to be issued for reduced periods of validity in certain circumstances: for example, in the case of an applicant who has a history of persistent passport loss.Section 10 sets out provisions regarding the name in which a passport is issued.  This is designed to underpin existing practice.  The general rule under subsection (1) is that the passport is issued in the name of an applicant as it appears in his or her birth certificate.  Where citizenship is acquired other than by birth, for example, through naturalisation, the reference point is the name on the relevant supporting documentation.Subsection (2) provides for a change of name after marriage.  Subsections (3) through (5) deal with other changes of name.  In line with current practice, an applicant must produce satisfactory evidence of usage over a minimum of a two-year period.  As a safeguard against potential abuse of this provision, the Bill permits entry of the applicant's previous name in the passport.The provisions are such that the Irish and English languages will be treated equally.  If an applicant has a birth certificate in either language and wants to change to the other, he or she must provide evidence of usage over a two-year period.Section 11 deals with gender re-assignment and outlines the circumstances in which a person who is undergoing treatment or procedures to alter his or her gender, may be issued with a passport in his or her new gender and or new name.  Supporting evidence must be provided, including medical evidence from a registered medical practitioner.  Inclusion of this provision is intended to reflect and underpin existing practice of the Passport Office and not, as is made clear in subsection (3), to confer any other rights or entitlements.  The terms of section 11 were the subject of prior consultations with the Irish Human Rights Commission which has welcomed the inclusion of the provision in the Bill.  They also reflect current international practice in western Europe and like-minded countries.Section 12 outlines the circumstances in which a passport shall not be issued, as well as situations where the Minister has discretion in this regard.  The constitutional right to travel is not an unqualified right.  Section 12 seeks to reflect that position in legislation.  A refusal is mandatory in circumstances where there is uncertainty regarding citizenship or identity, where applicants are subject to orders under the Bail Act 1997, in cases where false information is provided and in situations relating to problems with consent of parents or guardians.Subsection (1)(c) provides for refusal where an applicant is likely to engage in certain forms of conduct, including conduct that might prejudice national security or the security of another state or that might endanger the applicant or other persons.  In view of the constitutional position, a refusal under subsection (1)(c) could not be taken lightly and there is provision for consultation, where appropriate, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and-or the Minister for Defence.Section 12(2) allows discretion to refuse where an application does not comply with one of the requirements of the application process as set out under section 6 of the Bill.  It also permits refusal of a second passport.  Second passports are currently issued to a small number of applicants, mostly frequently business travellers who are required to make substantial numbers of visa applications.  The individual circumstances are examined on a case-by-case basis.  Second passports are also provided to people who travel in the Middle East where an immigration stamp of one country can cause problems for our citizens visiting other countries.Section 13 deals with the inclusion in a passport of information including biometric data, an issue about which I spoke already in connection with section 8.  Section 14 deals with the complex area of issuing passports for children.  In line with existing legislation and practice, section 14 gives precedence to the welfare of the child and at the same time safeguards the rights of his or her guardians to take decisions regarding such welfare.  Accordingly, the priority requirement is that consent of parents or guardians must be obtained before a passport can be issued.  Where a parent or guardian withholds consent, a passport cannot be issued unless the other parent or guardian obtains a court order dispensing with the need for such consent.However, provision must be made for cases where there may be difficulties in obtaining court orders.  Subsection (5) recognises that where a child is resident outside the State with a parent or guardian, practical difficulties may apply with regard to obtaining a court order.  In such cases, it provides that the Minister, having regard to all the circumstances, including whether the other parent or guardian has notified an objection to the issuing of a passport, may issue where he or she is satisfied that this is required to secure the child's welfare.  The flexibility is required to ensure that injustices do not occur.Subsection (6) further outlines exceptional circumstances where a passport may be issued without the consent of one or more guardians of a child.  This will apply only where a guardian or other person with an interest in a child's welfare applies to the Minister and where there is an immediate and serious risk of harm to the child's life, health or safety which requires the child to travel.  Section 14(8) proposes that the consent of each guardian must be obtained for the issuance of the first passport and that this consent will continue unless a guardian notifies the Minister in writing that he or she is revoking consent.  The application form and accompanying notes will ensure that parents and guardians are fully aware of the position on duration of consent.Section 15 gives a legislative basis to the issuing of emergency travel documents.  Emergency passports are generally valid for one year and may be issued when an applicant produces evidence of an intention to travel immediately and where there is insufficient time to arrange the issue of a normal passport.  In some situations an applicant may need to travel urgently, but may not be able to produce sufficient documentation to establish beyond doubt his or her entitlement to a passport.  The Bill provides that in such cases an emergency travel certificate may be issued where there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant is an Irish citizen.  An emergency travel certificate is valid only for a single journey and generally such cases relate to an individual travelling abroad whose passport has been lost or stolen and who wishes to return to Ireland.Section 16 provides for the issuing of diplomatic and official passports.  Diplomatic passports are issued to those who have diplomatic status or to those who belong to a group that has been designated by the Minister to be issued with diplomatic passports.  Official passports are issued to Irish public servants who travel abroad on State business.  The main group in this category are Irish soldiers serving abroad with the United Nations.Section 17 requires that where a person believes that his or her passport has been lost or stolen, he or she shall notify the Minister and the Garda Síochána.  The Minister is permitted to inquire into the circumstances of a case and to require the provision of such information as is considered necessary.  Section 18 permits the Minister to cancel a passport in certain circumstances and provides for the surrender of a cancelled passport.Section 19 provides for offences and penalties for the misuse or abuse of passport facilities.  Under the law at present, offences concerning the abuse of passports are regarded as general offences relating to property and they are covered by several Acts.  There is a need to strengthen safeguards in this area and to provide for specific legislation to cover passport offences.  Accordingly, the Bill defines a series of offences and also provides for prosecution of such offences where committed outside the State.  Offences under section 19 include making false applications, possession of a false passport, use or attempted use of a cancelled passport or a passport issued to another person and sale or attempted sale of a passport.The growth in demand for passports in recent years is partly attributable to the increasing use of passports as evidence of identity and age.  In recognition of this trend, section 19(2) provides for an offence where a person knowingly uses or attempts to use another person's passport for the purpose of admission to the bar of a licensed premises as defined under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.Sections 20 to 24, inclusive, set out related provisions concerning definitions, summary trial in the District Court, proceedings outside the State, liability of bodies corporate and an amendment to the Bail Act 1997.  Section 25 provides that a passport shall remain the property of the Minister at all times.  This reflects the long-established practice to print a statement to this effect on all Irish passports.Section 26 is a standard provision which provides for continued validity of passports issued before the commencement of the Act.  The practice of including children on their parents' or guardians' passports has been discontinued with effect from 1 October 2004, with children subsequently required to be issued with their own passports.  As set out in subsection (2), inclusions of children prior to that date remain valid for the lifetime of the relevant passport or until a child reaches the age of 16, or is issued with his or her own passport.  However, I strongly recommend that parents ensure that children have their own passports as international practice is increasingly demanding that each citizen carries his or her own passport.  Finally, section 27 is a standard provision authorising the levying of fees for passports and other consular services.That completes my detailed statement on the purpose and main provisions of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	173	This is quite a simple Bill that puts in place the administration of passports, as well as offences for the abuse and misuse of such passports.  Having listened to the Minister of State and the reference to the births and deaths register, I believe that passports should be compulsory for everybody.  It would save many problems for us.  We had a big furore last year about the register not being kept up to date.  There were questions about identification cards and difficulties with calculating the number of people in the State.  A simple solution would be to require everybody to have a passport and to tie it in with the births and deaths register.This also affords us an opportunity to look at the concept of including a small insert in the passport that can be taken out and used as identification locally.  One of the reasons so many passports are lost is that young people carry them when going into a public house.  It is a relatively big document in comparison to a laser card or a visa card.  There would be merit in looking at the concept of replicating the passport on the equivalent of a visa card and inserting it in the passport.  People can leave their passports at home and take out the insert, which is basically a replica of the biometric information in the passport.Considering we have had such difficulties with false passports since the late 1970s, it is strange that it has taken us so long to bring forward such simple legislation.  It is disturbing to think that the Colombia three have never been charged for an offence relating to the misuse of passports.  That is a reflection on us all and I hope it does not reoccur.  With a little bit of innovative thinking, we could solve many problems in that area.When we talk about passports, we often think of the old scheme of passports for sale which caused a lot of controversy in Ireland.  Some people who bought passports or Irish citizenship invested money in Ireland and did well during difficult times.  When one reflects on a period from a contemporary perspective, it is often difficult to imagine the needs and requirements of the day.  From today's perspective, it is difficult to imagine the concept of selling passports.  It was a bad practice and I am glad it has been discontinued.  I would not wish to see its re-introduction as passports and citizenship are valuable and should not be for sale.I understand two offices issue passports, one in Cork and the other in Dublin, and I believe the Dublin office is earmarked for relocation to Balbriggan as part of the decentralisation programme.  This may not be a good idea because, even at the best of times, it would be difficult for those travelling from Wexford or Galway to reach Balbriggan.  Although it is a nice seaside town that has experienced decent growth in recent years, this decision is unwise as passport offices should be central and accessible.  I recognise the passport office located on Molesworth Street is overcrowded.  As Members can confirm every day as they walk past the office, there is enormous demand for the service it provides.  Nevertheless, this is not a sufficient reason to relocate it to Balbriggan, which would cause difficulties.  I ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to reappraise its position in this regard.Irish citizens require passports to travel everywhere except Britain.  As some airlines require identification when one travels there, the small insert in the passport might be useful.  One could leave one's passport at home to act as one's template or hard drive while travelling with a small disk, which would make travel much easier for all.  Moreover, those who lost their passports or encountered difficulties would have a backup document available.I refer to children on passports.  I have young children and the faces they present at passport control are hardly identifiable from their former appearance.  The proposal to remove children from adult passports is worthwhile because this causes great difficulties when someone becomes ill or a mother is obliged to come home with a child.  I encountered a case last year in which a mother who was abroad was obliged to return home for a certain reason.  However, her child, who had travelled on the mother's passport, remained in Spain and the family was required to obtain an emergency or temporary passport.While this Bill is not highly controversial, when the concept of using biometric data in passports was first raised in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, some civil rights groups thought it might constitute an intrusion.  Any measure that can be taken to assist in the security of citizens is welcome and this is not a difficult measure to take.The Minister issued a statement some time ago to the effect that the cost of introducing this measure was €6.1 million, having been estimated at €8.8 million at the outset.  However, the legislation's introductory document mentions a cost of €34 million.  I assume the latter cost includes the technology that must be put in place at airports.  The Minister of State should clarify, perhaps on Committee Stage, what are the costs.  While two different figures have been put forward, I am sure they are not directly comparable.Will this technology be in place when the passports come into being?  The Minister of State's contribution leads me to believe that one will still be able to use one's old passport.  However, those travelling to the United States with their old passports will be obliged to obtain a visa while those with biometric passports will be able to travel there without a visa.  Will it be possible for citizens to cash in, for want of a better word, their old passports before their dates of expiration and obtain biometric passports to avoid being obliged to secure a visa?While I am not an expert in biometrics, I refer to the scenario in which a person playing hurling in Wexford receives a blow from a hurl that breaks his nose——

Could this have an impact?  I would hate to think that an Irish person who had travelled to New York for a weekend to play hurling could, while returning, end up in Guantanamo Bay for carrying what was deemed to be a false passport, based on the biometric read-out.I understand the EU legislation will require the inclusion on the document of fingerprint data from 28 February 2008.  I do not know whether this is one of the measures from which Ireland will be excluded and perhaps we have an opt-out in this regard.  However, this issue should be considered.  This will be a requirement across the EU in those members states that have signed up to it.  It appears that Ireland has decided to store facial biometric data only and has decided not to proceed with fingerprint data, although the Minister of State alluded to the fact that this may be a requirement in future.  I understand it will be a requirement from 28 February 2008 and this matter should also be considered.I am disappointed that Ireland has chosen to exercise an opt-out at today's intergovernmental meeting at Lisbon from the justice and home affairs section of the reform treaty.  Any measure to which we can sign up that will assist the safety of citizens and help deal with criminality is welcome.  I do not believe the claim that Ireland has concerns regarding the potential impact on common law is justified.  Many statutes have been passed since 1922 that have had an impact on common law and we have managed to survive.Another welcome measure concerns gender reassignment.  While I do not imagine it will be required frequently, this issue has caused much difficulty for some people and it is important to recognise this aspect.  I welcome its inclusion in the Bill.I note the Minister has the power to refuse to issue a passport.  In recent weeks, some controversy has arisen regarding the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's refusal to issue a visa to a gentleman who wished to come to Ireland to participate in a lecture.  It is important that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is able to refuse to issue a visa if he so wishes or that he can refuse to issue a passport to someone on the grounds of security.  Such grounds must be solid and this facility only should be used sparingly.  However, it is important to reserve the right to so do.In his response, the Minister of State should be more specific as to the circumstances in which the Minister might refuse to issue a passport to an Irish citizen.  I refer to a person who may be on early release for an offence such as paedophilia, if any such person exists or is on the child sex register.  Will people such as those, who apply for passports, acquire them or not?  I seek more specific details in this regard as the legislation is not as prescriptive as it might be.  Perhaps this issue can be considered on Committee Stage if the Minister of State does not have the requisite information to hand.  In recent years, have many applications from Irish citizens been turned down?  I am aware that under the Constitution and based on a legal judgment, people are entitled to a passport.  How many people have been denied passports in recent years?The issue of emergency travel is one of the nightmares associated with being a politician.  I refer to getting a telephone call on Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning to the effect that someone has lost a passport.

I must admit this happened to me one Sunday evening when I discovered my passport had expired.  Moreover, I have five young children and one Saturday afternoon a couple of years ago, when in a queue for a flight, we discovered my wife's passport had expired.  Naturally she missed the flight but was able to travel later on.  I thank the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, who I have always found to be most kind, courteous and facilitating, both to me at that time and to all members of the public who encounter similar difficulties.  There is nothing worse than opening one's passport, seeing one's face and realising the date of eligibility has expired.  It has happened to everyone.  While it is bad enough to find out one's laser card is out of date, expired passports are a somewhat more difficult matter.  I do not know how common this is, although it happens to us all occasionally.  I wonder whether there would be some merit in having passport information offices at the main airports.  I am not necessarily saying the Department of Foreign Affairs should have a kiosk there, with one of its hard-working staff present on a Saturday and Sunday — I would not go that far — but it may be useful to have an information centre of some sort.  Perhaps these are already there and I am not aware of them but in my own case, I was lucky in that I had the telephone number I needed to call.  If we had information centres, people could go there to obtain this information and be told what they should do.  I was facilitated — I was thankful for it — but it was only because I had certain numbers in my telephone that I was able to do this.  I would not have been able to obtain this information at the airport if I did not already have it.  Alternatively, the required information could be given to the airport manager in order that if a person realises that he or she does not have a valid passport, the airport manager could tell him or her what must be done.I tabled a parliamentary question a few years ago about lost passports and, if memory serves, it was very difficult to establish how many had been lost or found.  There seemed to be no method to it.  There may have been a breakdown in communication between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs.  If we were to introduce a new system under which there was an electronic record of every passport, we would be able to deal more satisfactorily with this issue.  In many cases passports are lost or stolen through no fault of the holder, but I am concerned that on occasion, a person abroad who is strapped for cash may willingly sell his or her passport and then report it stolen.  I am sure this is a relatively common occurrence, although I do not know whether anyone has been charged with such an offence.  I would appreciate if such information was made available at some stage before this legislation is passed.In court cases, when a person is granted bail, the judge may make a court order under which he or she must surrender his or her passport.  Are there any other circumstances under which a person must surrender his or her passport?  Who has the power to order this?  Is it the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  I would appreciate clarification of this issue.I have covered most of the issues with this legislation, which I welcome.  However, I ask the Minister to consider one other item.  My understanding is that third generation Irish people in other countries can obtain an Irish passport, but from the fourth generation onwards they cannot.  There are many people of Irish descent in South America, particularly Argentina, where Irish people went in the mid-19th century.  There may be a fear that people will try to obtain Irish passports in order to gain access to other EU countries, but we should not be afraid to consider bilateral agreements on Irish passports with the United States or Argentina.  We often hear about the need to attract people with certain labour skills to Ireland.  If there are people of Irish descent who would like to return to Ireland, our door should be open to them.  The Department might consider this.  I think I am correct in saying third generation Irish people can obtain passports, while fourth generation descendents cannot.  We should consider whether there would be merit in setting up a scheme such as I mentioned, particularly with Argentina.  My party leader recently met an Argentinian of Irish descent who raised this issue.  Many people, particularly from the Longford-Westmeath area, went to Argentina in the 19th century.I welcome this legislation.  A passport is a valuable document which should not be debased.  A correctly administered passport scheme could give us the key to obtaining much information and could also solve many other problems.  It would be great if, in a couple of years — in fact, it would probably be longer than that, but sometime in the future — we did not have to worry about who was on the electoral register or similar issues because everybody would have a passport which could also be used as a form of identification.  The issue of carrying ID is a sensitive one, but it may become standard to issue passports with an insert which could be used as an ID card while the passport was safely in a drawer at home.  I welcome this legislation and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.

It seems incredible that during the years the issuing of passports has never been put on a statutory footing, but that is what we are doing today.  To me and those of my generation, a passport is a significant and important document which should be treated with care.  If one comes from a country with a passport system that is widely recognised and held in high esteem, one should take great care of one's passport.Deputy Timmins spoke about Argentina.  I cannot let the opportunity pass without mentioning that it is not just Argentina in which Irish people have made a significant impact.  One man from Cork, Daniel Florence O'Leary, emigrated to South America because he was a second son and hence would not inherit the family business.  He joined the Hussars and eventually became Simón Bolívar's biographer and second-in-command, accompanying him on all his campaigns in South America, including the liberation of Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and many other areas.  For this he is highly regarded in Venezuela.  We have not done enough to exploit this Irish connection.  O'Leary has two direct descendents, a great-grandson and a great-grandnephew who have the good sense to live in Cork.

We should do so.  If that means offering a limited passport or some other manner of recognising Irish heritage, so be it.This legislation reminds me of another Bill on which I spoke, not the last time I was elected to the Dáil but the time before that.  It was introduced by former Deputy Mervyn Taylor and, similarly to this Bill, was considered lightweight but it had a significant impact on how we gather information.  The Bill was one page long and proposed to extend the amount of information included in birth certificates.  Therefore, it has a connection with this Bill.  Up to that time, only the profession of the baby's father was listed on the birth certificate, but after the Bill was enacted, the mother's profession — home-maker or seamstress etc — was also listed.  This gave us an insight into social history which was not previously available to us.  A small Bill such as the one we are considering often has a far more significant impact on the State than is perceived at the time.As I mentioned, the notion that we are only now putting the issuing of passports on a statutory basis is staggering.  Passports are now being used far more internally than for international passage.  In the matter of using passports as a form of identification, I differ from the previous speaker.  In particular, young people must often use identification when entering nightclubs and bars, but in these places there is a significant risk that a passport will be either mislaid or stolen.  I agree we should consider introducing a national identification scheme, but this identification should not be in the form of a passport because a passport is too valuable a document.  The value of the Irish passport can be seen from the fact that Oliver North travelled with one during the Iran-Contra affair.  He knew that an American passport would not get him safely into certain countries but an Irish passport which was widely respected would.The idea that someone would apply for a passport because he or she needs identification for all sorts of purposes is outrageous and should not be allowed.  Young people have no choice other than to use the passport because every other document is considered suspect and inadequate.We need to introduce a national identification scheme, where people want to apply for it.  I admit I would not go along with it being compulsory but if people need to apply for a card as a means of identification, it should be available to them.  We should ensure our passports are kept as safely as possible rather than having people use them as a means of identification when they go out at night.  Thankfully, I no longer need such identification, but one would not know.  Passports are sought in opening bank accounts and in opening utility accounts and here again a national identification scheme would be a far better way of doing so rather than having to take out the passport.There are pros and cons to children having their own passports.  A mother is always nervous that someone will decide to take a shine to her child and take him or her off.  Mothers find that having their children attached to their passport gives them a degree of control and safety, but I understand perfectly why it is a better idea to have a child's individual passport.  We must be very careful about these matters.  We are not living in the type of world in which we all grew up.  It is a much more dangerous world and there are people who are much more deceitful and cunning than it appears people were in the past.The previous speaker dealt with the issue of change of gender.  It is a good idea, if one is to deal with passports and other documents of a life-long nature — even though one must change it every ten or maybe five years, nevertheless it does define one for life — and one's life changes dramatically through choice, then one should have the ability to change that detail in such an important document.  It is important that such a provision would be inserted.  I am sure that in the future there will be other changes as well but at least we will have the legislation to amend.The passport office in Cork is second to none.  My experience is like that of others who spoke here.  For instance, one Christmas morning people who were flying out the day after St. Stephen's Day came and the passport office staff were available to do their very best.  The amount of people who do not check their passport expiry date is astonishing.  The passport office responds and the response is the same to everyone, and that is important.  There are no judgment calls.  The staff simply do their job to an efficient standard and I really could not praise them enough.  It seems incredible that they can respond in such a fashion and give the information necessary to people who sometimes are quite distraught about the notion of it because they think back to the good old days when one had to wait up to a month to get a passport.  Now the passport office responds immediately and the staff are very good in gathering the necessary information.The passport system in Ireland and the issuing of passports has not always been as clearcut and defined as it is nowadays.  I still have a vision of a former Minister for Justice going to the Shelbourne Hotel with a bunch of passports to foreign businessmen.  No matter what was the investment potential, people who come here to invest their money for the long haul and put down roots should have to apply for a passport the same as the rest of us and their application should be treated favourably.  I am staggered by the notion that it could happen that one would issue a passport to people because they were investing money and had no intention of living here or had no commitment to the country, and that those passports would be delivered by a senior Minister, and it did happen.  I am glad that we have a framework in place whereby that type of event would never happen.  I hope we will never see its like again because that devalues the passport for all of us.When I go abroad and use my passport I know it does not entitle me to entry to the country I am approaching but simply defines me as an Irish citizen and if something goes wrong, then the Irish Government has an interest in me.  The fact that the passport is a document which is not only valuable, but is respected and issued in a particular way and is not open to being purchased, gives it a value to me that is beyond anything for which I could ask.  It is about the Government having an interest in me as a citizen and if anything should go wrong, then it will state that interest clearly.  That is the purpose of one's passport.  That is why we should not allow it be devalued by being used as a method of identification for the most spurious of reasons and we should ensure that does not happen again.I am glad to see provision in the legislation for penalties for people who abuse it, by using it falsely, by using a false passport, by stealing it etc.  I assume the reason the Columbia three were never charged was because there was no provision in legislation at the time.  That matter should be clarified because most people ask why they were not charged.  It was obviously because there was no offence.  It is handy to have that provision in place for all of us, not just people who have offended in the past but anyone who would find himself or herself in that position.  I am glad that provision is included.  I am glad we are at long last putting the issuing of passports on a statutory footing.  I am also glad it is down to a particular Minister whether or not a passport can be issued and the reasons it cannot be issued must be made clear as well.  There will be cases where a passport will be refused and we must put in place a clear passage of appeal.  That must happen because mistakes will be made — it is the nature of things.  We need to put a clear appeals system in place for no other reason than that people will get the exact reason they were refused and if it is wrong in any of its detail, they will be able to appeal the decision.Just like the legislation that Mervyn Taylor, the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, introduced in respect of stating what was the occupation of a mother, this legislation will be far more significant in years to come than it appears to be.  It is good legislation.  I am sure there will be bits and pieces to discuss on Committee Stage but, nevertheless it is welcome legislation which I hope will make us all sit up, take notice and appreciate the value of our passport.

Don chuid is mó, tá sé ceart go bhfuil an Bille seo curtha os comhair na Dála ach tá roinnt rudaí ann a bhfuil muid buartha fúthu — an ceart taistil lasmuigh den Stát agus an ceart go mbeidh pas ag duine atá luaite in Airteagal 40.3 sa Bhunreacht.  De réir sin, tá sé ceart go bhfuil reachtaíocht ann a thugann le fios an córas atá i gceist agus conas a déileálaimid le pasanna, conas mar a eisítear iad agus cad ba chóir bheith sa phas féin.  Faoi láthair tá seo faoi smacht reachtaíochta ó 1925.The Bill introduces the concept of the child's best interests into the decision-making process.  I welcome this change, as there are occasions when we need to have this approach to the fore.  Section 14 provides for the issue of passports to children and outlines the conditions governing this area, including the circumstances in which the consent of a parent or guardian is not required.  In these changed times, that is to be welcomed.  The change is consistent with the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.I also welcome the introduction of the right for transgender persons to change their gender on their passports.  This is a recognition of the world in which we live and the circumstances in which people find themselves.  This is the first time express recognition has been given to the rights of transgender persons in law.  This is a positive development which I hope is the start of the process of similar recognition in future legislation.  It is important for people to be treated on an equal footing.I have a number of key problems in regard to what is proposed.  Thankfully, between the first and final drafts of the Bill, the Minister addressed some of the problems that were highlighted.  However, I have a major concern about section 12 which provides for a refusal to issue passports.  This section gives the Minister dangerously extensive powers of discretion with no transparency.  The Minister of the day may make a decision on the basis of his or her opinion, or that of a colleague in Government, to deny a citizen a passport and, by extension, deny him or her the right to leave the State.  Those rights are outlined in Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution.  Thus the Minister can deprive individuals of this fundamental liberty if it is his or her view that they "might endanger public safety", "be contrary to the common good" or, in the often abused term, prejudice State security.This is a dangerous mechanism.  I recognise that at times there may be a need for that power to exist, however, the problem is there is no guarantee that in the case of a refusal to grant a passport or the withdrawal of one, the Minister would have to issue a clear and detailed statement of the reasons for the decision.  It is outrageous to vest such powers in one political personality.  The Government is essentially proposing that even where no convictions exist, and perhaps even where no charges have been preferred against an individual, the Minister alone, and in the absence of any independent or judicial oversight, can sentence an individual to a lifetime of severely restricted travel or State arrest.  In effect, this would result in the person having to remain within the State, given that travelling abroad in this day and age requires a passport.An individual who considered he or she was being wrongly denied his or her constitutional right could initiate judicial review proceedings but, as anybody who has gone down that road understands, to do so is a lengthy and expensive process which would clog up the courts.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us as to how many people have been refused passports in recent years.At a minimum, this Bill should provide that the Minister must issue to the individual a clear and detailed statement of the reasons for his or her decision to refuse the application for a passport.  Otherwise, the Bill should contain an appeal mechanism against a refusal to an independent body or individual, such as the Irish Human Rights Commission.  Some organisation should be available to review the reasons for an individual to be refused a passport.  I will table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.For once we are producing legislation to regulate how passports are issued.  The Bill introduces the use of biometric data to the process.  This automatically raises human rights concerns, especially regarding the right to privacy.  We have a data protection commissioner and the Irish Human Rights Commission.  In the main, I welcome the Bill.  I do not have a difficulty with the inclusion of biometric data on the passport per se, my concern relates to how the data is collated, stored and the other uses to which it can be put.From the Department's briefing note, it appears the Bill is a response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.  It should be noted that at no time has any evidence-based case been made to justify the introduction and retention of biometric and personal information belonging to passport holders.  I accept there has been a demand for this from the United States and it is also part of the "fortress Europe" agenda, for a tightening up of identification for security purposes.  That is the basis on which the Bill before us, and similar legislation in other countries, is predicated.I have yet to be convinced that such a change will prevent a similar attack to that which occurred on 11 September 2001.  We must take care to ensure we do not continuously undermine our basic rights in the pursuit of this agenda by forgetting the concept of human security.  If we address poverty, deprivation and other such problems throughout the world, we would have a more secure and stable international community and we would not be as open to the attack that took place on 11 September 2001 or the subsequent attacks in Madrid, London and other parts of the world.Let us consider the number of people who have been brought to this country, or other parts of the European Union, by human traffickers.  These people prove that it is possible to travel without passports to any country.  Interfering with the rights of law-abiding citizens will not change the situation, it will merely make travel more difficult and more expensive for us all.  I accept technology is developing but just because the United States has insisted upon it, does not make it right to introduce this highly expensive system which could potentially compromise human rights.  We have already jumped through the hoops with regard to passenger record numbers, PRNs, because the United States demanded them.  The whole European Union capitulated under the threat that no European citizen who was not compliant would gain entry to the United States.  At some stage somebody will have to call a halt.  In the past five years we have repeatedly passed European legislation with regard to fortress Europe.  This is part of the same agenda.One of the key principles of privacy in data protection is that any interference with rights must be justified and proportionate.  This is not proportionate or, at the least, it has not been demonstrated to me that it is.  In July last year the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner held, in regard to the Swiss biometric passport system, that the storage of biometric data on a central database was disproportionate to the objective of identity verification of passport holders.  I urge the Minister and his officials to consider this finding and ascertain whether we are moving beyond where we should be positioned at this time.For the purposes of the Bill, biometric data are defined as information relating to distinctive physical characteristics and may include measurements of the same.  Currently, the only biometric data in use for passports are facial images stored in a central database by the Department of Foreign Affairs — in other words, the photographs sent in are scanned and produced digitally on computer to make them easier to read.  There is a logic to this, particularly in this day and age, as it makes proceeding through passport control quicker because a computer can read the passport.  However, under the definition included in the Bill, at any time and without consultation the Minister could extend the biometrics required from passport applicants to include iris images, fingerprints and, potentially, even DNA profiles.  At a minimum, the Bill should be amended to limit biometric provisions to facial images, thereby requiring any further extension to be preceded by full Oireachtas debate and scrutiny.  Essentially, I ask that we proceed with the existing system of using the facial image only.  If the Minister wishes to include fingerprints, iris scans or other biometric data, the Bill should be brought back to the House to enable us to debate the measures to find whether they are proportionate and properly justified.Will the Minister confirm that the use of this database and its contents will be limited to that of processing the issuing or cancellation of passports, as this is not clear in the Bill?  If there are exceptions to this use, will he outline them?  If he addresses this question, the public will be content the database may only be used for passports and cannot be used for any other purpose.I questioned the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last year on the situation in the National Gallery which had introduced a security system which required staff to place a finger in a fingerprint reading device.  The staff were concerned by this.  The Minister stated in reply that the device identified two points of recognition rather than the standard used as evidence in a court, that is, ten points of recognition.  To recognise two rather than ten points of recognition might be sufficient for a passport.  I was further informed that when staff were scanned, the information was scrambled in order that it could only be used by the computer and not to tell when staff arrived or left.  If this type of biometric data is involved, we need to know.  There is not enough detail in the Bill for us to tell what level of biometric data is being or will be sought.  We need a commitment from the Minister to debate this matter further.  The way the world is, it is probable that extra criteria for passports will be added bit by bit.  The House should be able to determine whether such change should happen.Will the Minister demonstrate that the new passport system will not amount to the introduction by stealth of a massive biometric database which could be used by domestic agents such as the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social and Family Affairs and which cannot be used, sold on or exchanged with foreign security agencies?  Will he detail the safeguards he is putting in place to prevent the abuse of this huge amount of data, which could happen?  We do not want a repeat of the situation which arose last week, where a staff member in the Department of Social and Family Affairs leaked confidential information to a brother who used it to target a person to extort money.  Guarding against the security agenda is not the only issue.  We need a proper data protection system in place.  While all such activity is covered by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, owing to the nature of the data and the size of the database, we must include any extra elements required as the Bill moves through Committee and Remaining Stages.Section 8 states: "The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make such arrangements, including contractual arrangements, as he or she considers appropriate with such persons as he or she thinks fit for the processing of biometric data in respect of applicants for passports".  Is the Minister seriously considering privatisation or outsourcing?  One of the elements of the passport system is that it is operated by civil servants who have signed up to the Official Secrets Act and other requirements.  If we are considering outsourcing or privatising the processing of something as sensitive as biometric data, or even if there is such an option, we need to know.Section 3 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister, while section 5 provides for the performance of relevant functions by the Minister on the authority of the Government.  It would be preferable, as the Human Rights Commission has stated, if an explicit reference was included in the text of the Bill concerning the obligation of the Minister to take human rights standards into consideration.Tá a lán eile agam le rá agus labhróidh mé ar Chéim an Choiste faoi costais, an Ghaeilge agus gardaí ag síniú foirmeacha.

Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an mBille dul tríd an Chéim seo agus go mbeidh muid in ann Bille níos foirfe a dhéanamh de ar Chéim an Choiste.  Tá gá le sin.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabháil as ucht an deis labhartha seo a fháil.  I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, and departmental officials for introducing this Bill which, when enacted, will provide relief to those, like me, who are concerned about national security.  Unfortunately, events in the past decade have forced the Government and citizens to concentrate our minds on the effectiveness of our passport legislation and directly address the fear created by a resurgence in global terrorism.  We need to face up to the inadequacies of our passport and identity security systems.  This legislation to tighten regulation of the issuance and control of passports has been forced on us.  While I am sure many of my colleagues also wish that tighter controls, including some of the provisions in the Bill, were not necessary, I am reassured by the action being taken to enhance passport security for citizens.The Bill underpins many of the restrictions and controls that have evolved since the enactment of the original legislation in 1924.  I welcome the fact that the Bill consolidates a raft of disparate legislation and will, among other things, set in stone offences relating to passports.  It provides for the biometric processing of personal data and the general issuance of passports in a range of circumstances.  We are informed that many of its provisions are already in place and form part of routine procedures for issuing passports.The definition of a citizen's right to obtain a passport is set down in the Constitution.  The Bill, for the first time, sets down in law the rights of children in respect of the issuance of passports and makes many changes regarding parental and guardian consent in respect of the issuance of a passport to a child.  This is a welcome and necessary development.While these elements appear simple and obvious, when combined they create comprehensive legislation which will protect passport security.  A passport is one of the most important possessions a person can own.  Not only does it define our identity, it gives us power beyond what we could have envisaged 20 or 30 years ago.  In an enlarged Europe, to hold an Irish passport is of considerable benefit.My colleagues will have received large numbers of queries relating to citizenship and passports over the years.  With increasing demand for Irish passports, as reflected in the black market, comes a requirement to tighten security.  I have the honour of representing Dublin North, a constituency which includes Dublin Airport where the highest priority attaches to passport security.  Millions of people come through our airports every year, as is their right, and, while this has benefits for the country, in the modern climate measures are needed to ensure all persons travelling through airports hold secure, valid passports.  In October 2006, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, introduced a biometric or e-passport, a microchip document containing digital information that cannot be tampered with or altered.  I am pleased to note these passports are printed in Balbriggan in my constituency.  The introduction of e-passports, part of an overall European commitment to passport security, is warmly welcome.  Customs officials in Dublin Airport see the benefits of this new type of passport every day.Earlier this year, the Minister informed the House that 6,000 passports were stolen in 2006 and that his Department has an ongoing programme which urges members of the public to exercise vigilance in respect of their passports.  In time, as biometric passports become the norm, the loss or theft of passports will present less of a problem.  While I do not wish to underestimate the seriousness of the loss and theft of passports, details of lost or stolen passports are reported weekly across Europe and the world through the Garda and Interpol.  It is my hope that as biometric passports become more common, the number of passports lost and stolen annually will decline.I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's comments.  The case of the Columbia three embarrassed this country and biometric passports could have resolved many of the issues involved.This morning, we heard details of a study conducted by NUI Galway and Trinity College Dublin, which indicated that more than 70 women had been trafficked into Ireland in the past six years.  A separate report in The Irish Times covered the case of a man currently detained in Cloverhill Prison on foot of an extradition request from the Continent to face charges of child trafficking.  Had biometric passports been the norm several years ago, trafficking in persons would be much less common.  In this regard, I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will introduce a criminal law (human trafficking) Bill in the House next week.Passports form the basis of our national and personal security.  Air fares aside, passports are the real ticket into other countries and, as such, are of considerable value.  I welcome the fact that this is reflected in the Bill.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I propose to share time with Deputy Alan Shatter.I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael Kitt, on his appointment.  The Passports Bill 2007 is important and badly needed.  The failure to introduce updated legislation in this area has been a long-standing omission given that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the most recent legislation to deal with passports, was placed on the Statute Book in 1924.New legislation on passports is required primarily due to heightened awareness about passport security.  We do not want organised criminals to get their hands on passports to be used for fraudulent purposes.  Many Hollywood films show the results of identity and passport theft and it is important we address the problem.Biometric chips are capable of holding different types of personal information, including fingerprints, facial dimensions and iris scans.  The use of this type of technology to reduce fraudulent use of passports is welcome.  The computers and offices in which the information is stored should be secure to ensure the wrong people cannot access it for their own benefit.  The world has not faced as many threats as it has since the attack on the World Trade Centre.  Identity and passport fraud has been increasing, but this legislation will ensure the incidence of passport theft will fall.Will the estimated cost of €34 million to improve the passport service and introduce biometric passports have a direct effect on consumers through a rise in passport prices?  I have received complaints from constituents about the price being on the steep side.  For example, a ten-year 34-page passport costs €75 and a 66-page passport costs €100.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The Bill contains many welcome provisions, but are the penalties and offences sufficient when it comes to criminal gangs?  We are discussing fines of up to €10,000 and imprisonment not exceeding five years for certain offences or not exceeding ten years for other offences, but is the fine sufficient to concentrate the minds of criminal gangs?  As passports have been abused, the law should be tightened and I welcome the new provisions.I thank the staff of the passport office, who should be commended for their good work in providing passports, sometimes on short notice.  They step up to the plate and never leave anyone short of a passport in an emergency.  When people discuss passports, their first thought is of the passports for sale scandal in the 1980s.  We do not want a repeat because it affected our country's international reputation.  We must ensure that passports are not provided to people or businesses for big money.  Would it be possible to make provision for a passport for life?Deputy Kennedy referred to immigration services at Dublin Airport.  Is there sufficient staff to ensure regular checks of passports are conducted?  In recent years, there may not be sufficient staff at immigration points, in particular late in the evening.  This issue has also been raised in terms of ports.  Will the Minister of State examine the matter further?  There are many Irish people throughout the world, particularly in South America.  Are there plans to provide passports to third generation Irish?What are the circumstances required for the Minister to refuse to issue a passport as provided for in section 12?  Will the decisions be transparent and can they be appealed if people are refused passports?  Are there plans to introduce a passport for life as referred to by the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Timmins, when he suggested that passports should be compulsory from birth onwards?  This would be tied into the birth and death registers to ensure passports are rescinded when their holders die.The passport office is centrally located on Molesworth Street, but plans to move the head office to Balbriggan where there is related activity are of concern.  Located in the city centre, the office is accessible and amenable for many people, but a move to Balbriggan will make getting emergency or renewed passports more difficult for people from outside Dublin.  Will the Minister of State ensure that a presence will be kept on Molesworth Street?  Will the Government re-examine passport costs, which seem excessive?Regarding the holders of Irish passports in America, the 50,000 plus undocumented Irish comprise a significant issue.  It is disgraceful that some of them are unable to attend weddings or funerals at home due to their natural fear of not being allowed re-entry into the United States of America.  Will the Minister of State make it a priority to take care of the Irish abroad by ensuring the US Senate passes new immigration legislation?  It is disappointing that the US Senate refused to vote in favour of reforming legislation.  Having been active in that respect, will the Minister of State sustain pressure on Americans to take care of the Irish?  It would be appreciated.Will providing emergency passports become more difficult due to the use of biometric data or will the current process obtain?  Will the information be kept at a secure location to prevent the wrong people breaking in and getting their hands on sensitive information, such as private details, fingerprints, facial descriptions and iris scans?I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill, which is welcome and necessary in light of 11 September 2001.  We must increase security at airports and ports to ensure only the right people — those with valid passports — are getting through.  The main thrust of the Bill is progressive and I welcome its publication.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	188	While I may be the only Deputy who has issued passports, including emergency passports, I am not the only person in the Chamber to have done so.  I am looking to the bullpen.  It was a slow process in the pre-electronic age, but it was a task I enjoyed in Germany.I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment, which was well-deserved given his interest in the developing world.  I had the honour to be his colleague in the Seanad over the past five years, so I wish him the very best in his new job.It is more of a query than a criticism when I say the legislation before us is written in the spirit of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924.  The word "Minister" occurs throughout the Bill.  For example, section 17(1) states:If a person to whom a passport is issued believes that the passport has been lost or stolen, he or she shall notify the Minister and an Garda Síochána of the loss or theft as soon as practicable.This is clearly a polite administrative fiction because it is highly unlikely that a matter concerning an individual's passport will go anywhere near the Minister for Foreign Affairs except perhaps in one or two high profile or extreme cases.  The Passport Office will deal with these matters.  While I approve of issuing passports in the name of the Minister, do we need to maintain this fiction rather than identify the office which will actually issue and administer them?  The Bill's form of expression seems extremely old-fashioned.With regard to the passport for life suggested on the benches opposite, what photograph would one propose to attach to it?  Likenesses tend not to be particularly good even if the photograph was only taken the previous day, so what would they be like 40 years later?  I do not consider the suggestion a practicable one.I warmly commend the Passport Office, the head of which was a colleague of mine at the time of the Good Friday negotiations, on the exemplary efficiency shown by its colleagues in every dealing I have had with it as a private individual or public representative.  When I accidentally left my mobile telephone turned on while I was on holiday in Scotland this year, I received a call from a constituent in Carrick-on-Suir concerning a major passport difficulty.  The constituent was travelling later that day, so there was nothing for it but to contact the Passport Office, which resolved the problem in time.  I do not mean to encourage anyone to leave it to the last moment before travelling to check whether a passport has expired but the Passport Office did very well in the aforementioned emergency.  When my own passport was either lost or stolen in New York last year, the consulate there was very efficient in providing a temporary replacement.One of the outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement was the extension of passport facilities to Northern Ireland through the post office network.  It was a sensitive issue because it had to be addressed in a way that would not raise ideological resistance while at the same time fulfilling the spirit of the Good Friday commitment that, in the context of Northern Ireland, one could be British, Irish or both.  For practical as much as sentimental reasons, an Irish passport is a much valued badge of identity for one community and an attractive proposition for the other.  It may encourage people who would see themselves as British to also identify as Irish in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.In the old days, foreign travel was a rare event.  Passports were stored safely and seldom used, so I imagine the danger of loss or theft was much lower.  Unfortunately, from a security perspective, the uses for which a passport is demanded have proliferated.  I do not approve of Ryanair's demand for passengers to carry passports or driving licences on flights within the common travel area between Britain and Ireland.  The airline is almost setting itself up as a quasi-legislator in that respect.  People in their late teens and early 20s use their passports in nightclubs as a proof of age.  Most of us instinctively oppose identity cards but there are limited options in terms of photo identities.  I accept, however, that provision has been made for special identity cards for pubs and clubs.  My point is that passports are used more often than in the past and sometimes in less than secure environments.  It is not surprising, therefore, that the incidence of loss and theft has increased.  Consideration should be given to solutions to that problem, such as restricting the use of passports to their primary purpose.Significant levels of data have been collected on each of us.  Presumably the addresses on the unsolicited material which comes thudding through our front doors came from somewhere.  Passports do not make use of confidential information beyond the bare bones of place and date of birth, so they are different in that respect from one's social welfare or employment files.I do not share the civil libertarian concerns expressed here.  My philosophy is that provided one tries not to break the law little else matters in this regard.  Society is overseen in many ways and there are many ways to access information on people so perhaps we should accept this fact but take action in clear cases of information being misused.I am glad that the passports for sale scheme was terminated.  It seemed like a good idea at the time and members of all parties solicited passports for wealthy individuals who could contribute money to worthwhile projects in their constituencies.  Similar schemes were practised in other reputable democracies but nonetheless it was right to bring the practice cleanly to an end because it gave rise to scandal, suspicions and so on.There have been cases in which passports were misused.  I remember 20 years ago it emerged Irish passports were used on an American intelligence mission in the Middle East.  We duly complained without obvious consequences but sought to ensure it would not happen again.  Reference has been made in this debate to a celebrated incident some years ago which involved three individuals travelling to Colombia possibly on false passports.  Not everything has been clarified in that regard.  The brother of one of those men is a well-known journalist.  I do not mean to apply this to that person only but it is a pity that the media demands a degree of accountability of politicians which it does not apply to itself when an awkward situation arises.  I recall an incident last autumn where various documents leaked to a leading national newspaper were destroyed and court proceedings ensued.I am being careful not to name individuals outside the House but one of the people I referred to appears to have a very close relationship with a leading witness in a tribunal.  There appears to be a concerted effort to throw any type of allegation at the Taoiseach to try to bring him down.  Given that the lead witness is domiciled outside the country and could not possibly have knowledge of the background to the allegations being made, it is clear there must be a person or people guiding his hand.

I am not referring to Irish jurisdiction, but the attacks of 11 September 2001, for example, involved people who used passports and travel documents.  Given the vast number of people travelling, it is very difficult to check the identities of people quickly, but the biometric passport is intended to help in that regard.  When I was a passport officer 30 years ago there was a large black book in which various names were manually recorded but I am sure those days are long gone.Reference was made to the relocation of the passport office to Balbriggan and I share the view that a front office is needed in the city centre.  However, a great deal of passport processing is done by post so there is no reason that function must be carried out in Dublin city rather than another town.I welcome this legislation because, while there have been many Irish nationality and citizenship Bills, they are slightly separate, though connected, to this issue.  I am surprised to learn that there has been no recent passport legislation.  Where administrative practices exist, and given the close monitoring of administrative acts carried out by the Judiciary, it is important to ensure the law is clear.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I welcome the publication of this legislation.  It is an anomaly that no detailed passport legislation has been enacted in the history of the State.  The issuing of passports has, essentially, been a discretionary exercise carried out by the Minister of the day on behalf of the Government.Many of the provisions in this Bill are worthwhile but substantial amendments are required if great difficulties are to be avoided in a number of areas to which I will refer.  In one respect this Bill is seriously, if not fatally, flawed and will require very detailed amendment to ensure it works in a manner that protects people's constitutional rights.I will first consider the fatal flaw in the Bill that must be addressed.  It is important that the Bill sets out the backdrop to the issuing of passports and details the circumstances in which the Minister may decline to issue a passport and the circumstances in which passports already issued may be revoked.  It seems that the manner in which some of these issues are being dealt with loses sight of a fact detailed in the explanatory memorandum and referred to in the Minister's speech.Arising under the Constitution, in a law case in which I must make a declaration of interest — 20 years ago I represented the applicants in the particular proceedings — the courts held that people have a constitutional right to travel.  The Minister referred to that right to travel.  Based on the decision delivered in that case, every citizen has a constitutional right to travel.  In order to travel they require a passport, except within the common travel area, although Ryanair and some other airlines have their own perspective and impose passport requirements.  However, if we take it that people generally require a passport to travel, we start from a position, with the enactment of this legislation, that every citizen has a right to a passport.  Rights in the Constitution are delineated by the common good.  Therefore, this right is not an absolute right, but can be curtailed in circumstances that accord with the common good.  This is a summary of the court decisions in this area.These are issues the Minister has in mind in the content of this legislation.  I wish to refer specifically to section 12, which deals with the refusal to issue passports and to a later section which deals with revocation of passports.  Section 12, as phrased, confers a very wide discretion on the Minister.  It states that the Minister shall refuse to issue a passport to a person in a number of circumstances — first, if the Minister is not satisfied that the person is an Irish citizen.  This is reasonable and understandable.  Presumably, if someone is an Irish citizen, he or she will be able to establish that fact.  The second circumstance is if the Minister is not satisfied as to the identity of the person.  This should not give rise to too much controversy.  However, the area that gives rise to substantial difficulty is sub-paragraph 12(1)(c).  It provides that the Minister can refuse to issue a passport to a person if:(c) the person would be likely in the opinion of the Minister, after consultation, where appropriate, with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Defence or both, to engage in conduct that—(i) might prejudice national security or the security of another state,(ii) might endanger public safety or order,(iii) would be contrary to the common good, or(iv) might endanger that person [That is the passport applicant] or others.In a nutshell, this provision is designed to ensure that if we have our own domestic-grown citizen suicide bombers who want to use a passport to leave the country and perpetrate mayhem elsewhere, we can refuse to issue a passport for them, or we can refuse a passport to persons seeking a passport who have knowledge of matters relating to State security that could give rise to difficulties and place the State in danger.  I have no difficulty with provisions (c)(i) or (c)(ii), the prejudice to national security or the security of another state or the danger to public safety or order.  The State has a role to play in this area.  It also has a role to play where people might endanger themselves or others.People have a constitutional right to a passport.  However, based on the way this legislation is drafted, a person can be deprived of his or her passport and his or her constitutional right to travel as a result of a secret discussion that takes place, between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in which a conclusion is reached that if given a passport the person might prejudice national security or endanger public safety or order, or endanger himself or herself.  That secret discussion takes place, but no information is furnished to the person concerned and he or she is deprived of his or her passport.I have no doubt that if an individual citizen is deprived of a passport under this section, he or she could take the issue to the courts.  This section is open to serious constitutional challenge.  It is particularly open to challenge in circumstances where people are not given any information as to the basis on which they may be deprived of a passport and even more so in circumstances where there is no right of appeal.  The legislation does not prescribe any statutory appeals mechanism for people for whom it is concluded a passport should not be provided.I am not being naive about this area.  I understand the Garda special branch may have information or the State may have received information from Interpol which would indicate the significant security risk attached to providing an individual with a passport.  It may also be contrary to national security to make that information available in full to the person to afford him or her the opportunity to contradict it.  Equally, it could be the result of tittle tattle, reports in the tabloid press or malicious information provided to the Government about an individual that leads to someone being deprived of the right to travel.Earlier, Deputy Mansergh strayed into the area of tribunals and false allegations allegedly made against the Taoiseach.  I will not comment on that matter.  If it is true that people could give false information to tribunals to generate hearings that cost the State millions of euro, who can say some malicious individual who dislikes someone — perhaps a neighbour or someone who has done them down in business — may not furnish information seeking to prevent a person from obtaining a passport.  There are major difficulties with the provisions of this section and significant constitutional problems attaching to it.  If this legislation was referred by the President, under Article 26, for consideration by the Supreme Court, there is a serious possibility the provisions could be held to be repugnant to the Constitution and the legislation may never be enacted and signed into law.There are also serious difficulties attached to section 12(1)(iii).  This allows the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with or without a discussion with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence, to deny someone a passport because he concludes it would be contrary to the common good.  What does that mean?  I was interested to note this was not spelt out in the Minister's speech.  On what basis will it be concluded it is contrary to the common good that someone be given a passport?Let us give an example.  What, for instance, will happen if the Government is engaged in some controversial decisions and a meeting is to take place somewhere in one of the member states of the European Union at which Ireland is to sign up to some arrangement that is a cause of controversy at home?  Perhaps it may be learned that a group of people plan to leave Ireland to demonstrate in the foreign country against the actions of the Government or Minister.  If we had a particularly authoritarian Government — to put it at its most extreme a Chinese or Zimbabwean style government — or a Government that did not take too well to criticism on the international stage, would it not be hugely convenient to refuse, or at least delay, the issuing of a passport to prevent a person travelling, particularly if the person was known to be a member of an organisation going to demonstrate abroad, on the basis that it would be contrary to the common good or contrary to the good of Ireland in the context that it might, perhaps, affect our tourist industry or the image of the country?Let us assume that in ten or 15 years we have a Government of a different political complexion.  Perhaps Sinn Féin is the majority party in Government and it has a particular ideological view of the world and the rightness of its cause and wants to control those who criticise it on the international stage.  This section could be invoked in those circumstances to deny people passports.  In circumstances in which in a constitutional democracy people have a constitutional right to travel, articulated by the courts arising under Article 40.3 of the Constitution, to extend the discretion to Government to deny someone a right to travel on the very broad ground that it would be contrary to the common good — whatever that means — is far too wide and dangerous a provision and requires serious and further consideration.The powers to revoke passports mirror these grounds.  On any of these grounds, someone who has already been granted a passport can have their passport revoked and the first they may discover of it is when they are notified by letter to the effect that the Department of Foreign Affairs has revoked their passport.  What do they do next?  Are they given a reason?  Are they entitled to a reason?  There is no provision for that in the legislation.  Is there anyone to whom they can appeal?  There is no provision for that in the legislation.  Is there any appellate system composed of independent individuals who can give further consideration to this matter?  That is not in the system.  Are they to telephone their Deputy?  Are they to go to the High Court?  Are we to create a whole new set of High Court proceedings?If I have a passport and a constitutional right to travel, I do not believe the Government can arbitrarily revoke my passport without some form of procedure that gives me an opportunity to address any allegations made against me, in so far as that is possible within the context of protecting national security, and allows me to make my case as to the reason I should keep my passport.  I urge the Minister of State to give detailed, serious additional consideration to the section that deals with the revocation of passports and the provision that deals with the refusal to issue passports.A number of provisions in this legislation impact or impinge on what I would describe as the family law area.  I know they are well intended but they are also in some respects a cause of substantial difficulty.  Section 14(2) has an odd provision.  It states: "If a parent of a child is not a guardian of the child, the Minister shall, in determining whether to issue a passport to the child without the consent to such issue of that parent of the child, have regard to the circumstances of the case in so far as they are known to the Minister."  The purpose of that section, in a nutshell, is that if a child is born outside marriage, automatically the child's mother is a guardian of the child and the father is not a guardian.  The father can apply for guardianship to the courts or become a guardian by the consent of the mother.This section is clearly designed to facilitate some form of consultative process with the non-guardian parent, that is, the father of a child, in circumstances in which the mother seeks a passport but the way in which this operates is a mystery.  The father of a child born outside marriage could contact the Minister or the Minister's office, knowing that a mother is seeking to have a passport issued, and tell the Minister something about the background circumstance and, without further ado, the Minister can deny the mother the right to a passport for her child.  The child has a constitutional right to travel as well.Let us take that a little further.  There are circumstances in which children are born outside marriage in which the fathers refuse to support those children and mothers are forced to take court cases to get basic maintenance support and other financial help.  There are occasions when those mothers are threatened by the fathers that they will make their life difficult if they take such action or if they progress the proceedings to hearing.  A malicious father using this section, with regard to a mother of a child born outside marriage, could prevent a passport being issued if that mother wants to go on a holiday with her young child and needs to obtain the passport for the child, without the mother having any right of hearing, knowing the reason or being forewarned.  That is a very odd way to deal with those matters.  That subsection should be removed from the legislation.  If the mother is the guardian, she has the right to seek the passport for the child.  If the father has an objection, there are court procedures that should be available.The father can make applications to the courts to be named guardian and to prevent a passport being issued if issues exist relating to the child's welfare.  That should not be a function of the Passport Office in that way and it will cause difficulty and disadvantage to individuals who are caught in difficult family circumstances.  Unless the provision can be amended to address that problem, it should be removed from the section.Other similar difficulties arise.  Subsection (8) of the same section provides that the Minister may, for the purpose of subsection (1), regard a consent given in writing by a guardian of a child to the issue of a passport to the child as being the consent of that guardian, essentially until the child attains full age.  To take the example of a married couple, both have consented to the issue of a passport to the child, a passport is issued and the wife, for example, holds the passport, the marriage breaks down and the parent who does not hold the passport — in this instance, the husband, although equally it could be the wife — decides to leave the jurisdiction and abduct the child but they cannot get their hands on the passport.  They then go to the Passport Office secretly, without the other parent knowing it, and apply for a passport.  The Passport Office, under this section, examine their files — I presume some records will be maintained — and sees that there is already on file a consent from the other parent as guardian to the issue of a passport and a passport is issued.  That section is misconceived also.If there is a consent from a guardian to the issue of a passport, the consent should apply to the issue of that passport and should not continue to apply for the 18 years of a child's minority.  That provision is a hostage to fortune and in this sad and tragic area where we have cases of child abduction by both mothers and fathers in circumstances where marriages break down, that provision is an invitation to threat.  It provides a mechanism to facilitate the issue of passports without the other parent who is a guardian having any knowledge of any nature whatsoever.In the context of this legislation, there are other difficulties to which I want to make reference.  I am sorry if much of what I am saying is critical.  It is good that this legislation is before us and it is important that we engage in a true legislative process and seek to have it made better legislation when it is passed by the House.I have already dealt with what I referred to as the security provisions in the legislation.  Section 18(1)(d) allows for the revoking of a child’s passport when the Minister becomes aware of a fact or circumstances which satisfy him that, for the purpose of securing the welfare of the child, the passport be cancelled.  That is open to abuse not just in circumstances where a child is born outside marriage, but in the case of a warring couple who are estranged, whose marriage has broken down and the mother resents the father taking children away for vacation periods or the father resents the mother doing so.  Under this provision one of them could give information to the Passport Office which generates concern that something may be wrong although that is not the case.  The mother or the father might end up in Dublin Airport trying to check in for a flight only to discover, unknown to them, their passports have been revoked.  That should not be part of this legislation.  It should be dealt with by way of court order.In the context of those issues I want to ask a question of the Minister.  I would have liked to address other issues but we will have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.  What record system will be in place not just in his Department, but at points of departure from the State to indicate to airlines and others if someone presents a passport that has been cancelled or revoked?  How will that be known?  Will there be some central registry to which those who are licensed to do so can gain access?  How will this information be known by those to whom it is relevant in the context of security issues in this State and travel arrangements?  There are no provisions that I can see in this legislation that allow for that in a detailed way and that is something that must be further clarified.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Passports Bill.  Like many Members, this is an important Bill.  The tone and content of the debate was constructive.  There is a great deal of consensus in this area.  We all share a desire to ensure that our citizens obtain the highest level of service and security.It has been remarked to me that the Bill is very accessible.  In so far as it is possible to do so with complex legislation, efforts have been made to use straightforward and plain language.  Enactment of the legislation should, in turn, help to streamline the operation of our passport service and should result, ultimately, in a more effective and efficient service for the public.  The legislative foundation should ensure that we can now take forward the passport service.The Passport Office has the largest client base of any State service, with an estimated 4.2 million valid Irish passports in use.  This covers Irish citizens throughout the world.  Ireland is unusual in having such a high proportion of its adult population with passports, with an estimated nine out of every ten holding a current passport.I referred in my opening remarks to the major innovations introduced in recent years and, in particular, to the development of the e-passport.  Not alone has the inclusion of biometric data greatly enhanced the integrity and security of the Irish passport, it has also meant that Irish citizens can continue to avail of the visa waiver scheme for entry to the United States of America.  This means a reduction in inconvenience and cost.  The application fee for a standard non-immigrant visa is €80.In reply to Deputy Timmins, we must maintain our visa waiver status.  Last year, almost 500,000 trips to the United States were made by Irish citizens.  Ireland is now in the top ten countries for visits to the United States.  More people visit the United States from Ireland than from the continent of Africa or China.  This is astonishing for a country with a relatively modest population.  If we were to lose our visa free status there could be a sudden halt to visits to the United States of America.  The US Embassy in Dublin has indicated that in such an eventuality, it could not service the local demand for visas.  In no time there would be long queues in Ballsbridge and a wait of several weeks for an interview to obtain a visa.  Our visa free status demands that we maintain the high technological standard of our passport and ensure the integrity of our overall passport system.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I will deal with the Deputy's query later.The Passport Office is the only State service which operates on the ground in all 32 counties.  There are 70 post offices throughout Northern Ireland which are part of the overall network for processing passport applications.  The level of applications made through Northern post offices has been rising steadily in the past two years.  This trend is likely to continue.  This year, we will issue 60,000 Irish passports in Northern Ireland.  I am delighted to learn that applications are arriving from all parts of the community.  This is a testament to the quality of the service provided by the Passport Office.At the opening of this debate, I outlined the sanctions available under the legislation against those who would seek to undermine our system.  The Government is also anxious to ensure that citizens' rights are not unfairly impinged.  The Passports Bill 2007 was the first occasion when a Minister, other than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, formally referred draft legislation to the Irish Human Rights Commission under the terms of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000.  This referral was warmly welcomed by the commission, which is hopeful that other Ministers will follow the lead of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In its observations, the commission considered that this legislation brought to an end what it described as a notable omission from the Irish Statute Book.  The Government fully agrees and believes the Bill is an important legislative initiative.  I also welcome the commission's view that the legislation is progressive and is an important step towards the clear and consistent protection of human rights in the area of the right to travel.  Irish citizens will have the right to a passport enshrined in law with a small limited number of exceptions.We live in a very different Ireland from that of our parents.  Our laws and administrative practice must reflect those changes, as well as our international obligations.  The need for enhanced security is a major feature of international travel, as is the need to guard against identity theft.  In all walks of life we must strike a balance between conflicting pressures.  I believe the Passport Bill achieves the correct balance between the need to secure the rights of our citizens and legitimate security concerns.Deputies made some very interesting comments during the debate.  Deputy Timmins raised the issue of lost and stolen passports.  Prior to 2005, when the automatic passport system was introduced, the figures for lost, mislaid or stolen passports are only available for Ireland.  Since the introduction of centralised production in 2005, we can give worldwide figures.  The introduction of the biometric passport, or e-passport, on 16 October 2006 has greatly enhanced the security features of the Irish passport.  The presence of a microchip containing a digital image of the holder has meant, for instance, that any photo substitution can now be more readily and easily detected.  In 2003, 21,800 passports were lost, stolen or mislaid.  In 2006, the figure was 38,713.  One must bear in mind that the figures since 2005 are worldwide.  The percentage figures for lost, stolen or mislaid passports were 4.6% in 2003 and 6.15% in 2006.Deputy Timmins also raised the issue of the validity of existing passports.  Machine readable passports have been issued since 1993.  Handwritten passports issued at embassies abroad will require a visa for the United States only.  All other countries accept handwritten passports.Given that Ireland is not part of the Schengen agreement we have no legal requirement to put fingerprints on the e-passport.  Ireland, with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, has decided not to move to fingerprinting of citizens for passports at this stage.  We have not ruled it out for the future, depending on international developments.  For the present we will use facial imaging.Applicants may apply for a passport by post through their local post office or in person at public offices in Dublin and Cork.  There is also a production facility in Balbriggan which handles postal applications.  There are no current plans to move the public office from Molesworth Street to Balbriggan.  The question of additional local offices will be kept under review.Deputy Kathleen Lynch welcomed the Bill and spoke about the citizenship requirement set out by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Like her, I am aware of the huge contribution of our diaspora to societies throughout the world.  The Irish passport is widely respected and I agree that it is a valuable document.  The question of a national identity card is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I will not comment on it.Deputy Lynch mentioned the more frequent use of passports and referred to young people using passports as identification at places of entertainment such as discos.  This may be a reason more passports are mislaid or stolen.  She referred to passports being used fraudulently for identification purposes, for example, in opening bank accounts.  It is crucial to protect the integrity of the passport.  I welcome Deputy Lynch's support on the transgender issue and her kind words for the Cork Passport Office.  I will pass on her comments.  Deputies have also praised the service in the Dublin Passport Office in Molesworth Street and Balbriggan.Deputy Lynch referred to the sale of passports.  I do not agree with that practice, which is now a matter for history.  There is  no question of such a practice taking place today.Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked the reasons a passport may be refused.  Refusals generally occur where an applicant has not established his or her identity or right to citizenship.  They also arise in respect of problems with parental consent or in respect of an order under the Bail Act.  It would be rare for a passport to be refused for other reasons given the constitutional right to travel.  However, I wish to inform Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Shatter that it is intended that an appeals will be introduced to complement the existing provision of judicial review.Section 19 deals with offences and penalties.  There exists already several Acts to deal with general offences in respect of property.  There is a need to strengthen safeguards in this area and to provide specific legislation to deal with passport offences.  Deputy Terence Flanagan asked about the cost of a passport.  There is no price increase envisaged.  The fee for a standard ten year Irish passport is €75.  It was increased from €57 in March 2004, the first increase since 1993.  This fee ranks mid-range in terms of passport fees among EU member states.  The UK passport is much more expensive.Some €34 million has been spent on the new system, including €6.6 million on biometrics.  I assure Deputy Flanagan that the undocumented Irish in the United States will remain a priority.  On the issue of the passport for life, which was partly answered by Deputy Mansergh, the Irish Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, states that ten years is the maximum period for which a person may obtain a passport.Deputy Mansergh asked why the Bill contains such a large number of references to the Minister.  The Passport Office is an integral part of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is not a separate agency or quango.  References to the Minister are necessary as he or she is answerable to the Dáil in this regard.  I welcome and agree with Deputy Michael Kennedy's remarks on the value of the electronic passport which greatly enhances international security.  As pointed out by him, the inclusion of the biometric chip greatly reduces the risk of theft and misuse of stolen passports.While Deputy Shatter welcomed the Bill, he again raised the issue of refusal of a passport.  The Attorney General was closely involved in the drafting of this Bill.  The Government would not put forward a measure which it believed to be unconstitutional.  No citizen will be refused a passport for political reasons.  The courts would not permit this.  Deputy Shatter also raised issues relating to family passports.  Section 14(2) prevents the taking outside of the country of a child where a custody case is being taken.  This provision would only be used in exceptional circumstances.I thank all Members who contributed to the debate.  I am pleased the Bill has received such a warm welcome.  I commend the Bill to the House.

As I sat and listened to the competing erudition about feudal statutes, the rule in Bain and Fothergill, the implications of the Tulk v. Moxhay decision, the omission of adverse possession and squatters’ rights and the nostalgia for the Statute De Donis Conditionalibus, I was overcome by a definite feeling of inadequacy.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Deputy Flanagan's conjured up images of examiners of title with wet towels around the backs of their necks brought me out in a cold sweat.  This Bill is not for the uninitiated.  The people in my constituency of Jobstown reflect on very little other than the Statute De Donis Conditionalibus.The average person will simply want to know if this Bill will speed up and streamline the conveyancing of land and if it will result in reduced costs.  Business people, nowadays this includes most farmers, will want to know if the new law will assist the business environment and enhance competitiveness.  Many new apartment and homeowners struggling with recent and often oppressive proliferation of management companies will want to know if it offers them better protection or if they are included.  Members on all sides of the House welcome the fact that this legislation will make it easier to convey and register land thus reducing delays.I join my colleagues who have contributed to the debate in acknowledging the role of the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, in driving this project as a joint initiative between the Department and the Law Reform Commission.  It appears that a small number of lawyers and experts in this area deserve our gratitude for a complex task, knowledgeably discharged under the direction of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and her predecessor, Mr. Justice Declan Budd.It is true it is not typical for the regularly excellent reports of the Law Reform Commission to come with a ready made text of a draft reform Bill.  Given the quality and comprehensiveness of the accompanying explanatory memorandum on this occasion, perhaps the Minister should involve the Law Reform Commission in the drafting process more frequently.  In fairness to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the former Minister's legislative style was to never stay still long enough to allow the preparation of an explanatory memorandum.The Minister, when introducing the Bill, drew heavily on the Law Reform Commission consultation paper.  There is little point in my regurgitating some of the more interesting tracts from that report though they are very interesting.  However, I should put on record that the Labour Party takes no issue with the sensible guiding principles that underpin the Bill which updates the law to ensure it accords with changes in modern society, promotes simplification of the law and its language to make it more easily understood and accessible, promotes simplification of the conveyancing process, especially the procedures involved and the taking of security over land, and facilitates extension of the registration of title to land and the introduction of an e-conveyancing system as soon as possible.As stated, the proposed modernisation of our land and conveyancing laws is welcome.  Involved in this process is the consignment to history, in whole or in part, of many pre-1922 statutes and their replacement with provisions more suited to modern conditions.  The ultimate goal is a comprehensive system of e-conveyancing.  I ask the Minister to hazard a guess at how soon implementation of such a system is likely to be realised.The consultation paper from the Law Reform Commission stated that registration of title was outside the scope of its report because it was dealt with recently by the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006.  It also states, however: "What is needed primarily is completion of the computerisation programme instituted in recent years and rapid progress on extension of compulsory registration of title so as to achieve the ultimate aim of having all titles throughout the State in the system."  The Minister might ask how long that project is likely to take.  The layperson finds it very difficult to appreciate why the conveyancing process in the 21st century should be so cumbersome.  The layperson, in his or her innocence, might have thought modern technology would greatly assist the process.  The lesson from other fields of commerce is that if the process can be made amenable to modern technology surely it can be speeded up and made less expensive.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It is a long learning period.  The Minister's own learned introduction of the Bill was fascinating.  The average citizen, however, wants to know what the changes mean for him.  Will conveyancing cost him less?  I know that learned counsel, even those on leave of absence from the Law Library, do not like discussing fees but the interests of the average citizen are far more practical.  The academic and sociological history may well be fascinating but what does it mean for me?  The Minister seems happy enough to promote the macroeconomic benefits when he says an efficient system of title registration and transfer is essential for economic growth — and so say all of us — but there is not a word of what savings are likely to accrue to the individual purchaser, consumer and user.The background to how approximately 85% of land in the State came to be registered in the Land Registry is the story of the agrarian revolution and how peasant proprietorship superseded Michael Davitt's original objectives.  I did not know that compulsory registration of title applies, at present, in only six counties, namely Carlow, Laois and Meath from 1970 and Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath since 2006.  The extension of compulsory registration of title seems a huge challenge for the property registration authority and if the Minister is correct that an efficient e-conveyancing system can only operate in respect of registered land then we have a very long way to go.  Apparently, if and when this project is realised the Registry of Deeds, after 300 years, will become of interest only to historians and archivists.  If we have waited since 1877——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	If we have waited since 1707, we can wait another few years.Great urgency is required, however, on a different issue, which is not addressed in the Bill but which people cannot afford to wait so long to be addressed.  It concerns the plight of the many clients of property management companies.  I saw recently that an estimated 500,000 people are in such circumstances so this is a major issue in property law.  The Minister lectures us about the distinction between property management agents and property management companies, which is all very well, but, given the daily experience of so many heavily indebted young people — most are young — who are struggling to make ends meet, the Minister's distinction is somewhat arcane.  As far as such people are concerned the property management company is frequently the plaything of the developer.The employment of a property management agent is part of the confusion and obfuscation because the developer can manipulate the property management company.  He can, for example, retain a couple of units in his ownership, by which he can frustrate the application of the normal company law provisions.  He can use the property management agent to distract unsuspecting clients, who never intended to wake up wedded to a property management company and did not understand that was what they had signed up for.  The local authority escapes responsibility for the taking in charge of such developments and is happy to look the other way.  It is the best thing that ever happened to local authorities, given the backlog they already have in respect of the taking in charge of more conventional estates in urban and suburban areas.  They are delighted at the new strategem by which so many units can grow up overnight, for which they do not have to take responsibility.Property management agents can obfuscate and delay in delivering the services it has contracted for.  Many people who live in multi-unit developments would not be concerned about the detail of company law if the services for which they paid were delivered.   Very often, in my experience, those services are not delivered and, when fees are arbitrarily increased, customers have no resort to the local authority and the management company, if it can keep track of the matter, which it usually cannot, will refer them to the management agent.  The agent then claims he is helpless as he only has so much money in the kitty and is doing his best.  In most cases, the agents have no experience of being a company, running it according to company law and requiring the services for which they have contracted be delivered.  It is a mess.It is very well for the Minister to say he looks forward to the final report of the Law Reform Commission.  He said: "It will provide a foundation for which we can develop the necessary amendments to the legislation that regulate these corporate entities."  That is a marvellous sentence.  The Minister is well capable of such a sentence but I do not know if he came up with it himself because it needs to be worked on and there is a lot involved in it.  If the 500,000 occupants of the developments to which I referred have to wait for the entire process to come to completion, this will be a project for the Minister's successor and that will not be greeted warmly outside this House.  Thousands of people need redress now.If the Law Reform Commission did such an excellent job as we have credited it with doing, in not only publishing the consultation paper but in producing the text of a draft Bill, surely the Minister can approach the commission to ask its members to undertake a similar task in respect of this more modern problem, and to resource it accordingly.  The Minister is now saying that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the National Consumer Agency and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are involved.  Anyone with any experience of Government knows that the drafting process in such circumstances is a never-ending project and its effect is to put it on the long finger.  Who will take the lead?  Will it be the Companies Registration Office or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I am glad to hear that.  This is the first time it has been made clear in this House which Minister will take responsibility for bringing legislation before the House.  Given the amount of contact there would have to be between officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of the consumer, enforcement and company law angles, it would take an unconscionably long time if we were to go down the traditional route.The more modest step proposed by the Minister in respect of property management agents to bring them within the remit of the licensing system proposed for auctioneers or the National Property Services Regulatory Authority is welcome but it will make little impact on the substantive issue I am trying to ventilate.  It is clear from what the Minister has said that at least we now have a situation where a single senior Minister is responsible for the task of initiating legislation and bringing it before the House.  The Minister may consider that he is embarking on a thankless task because the issue is quite complex.  However, he must have tens of thousands of people in his constituency who are awaiting redress.  There may be more of an electoral dividend in this than the Minister considers.  There may be one or two developers with their noses out of joint, but it would never cause Fianna Fáil any grief to bring that about.  I ask the Minister to come down on the side of the tens of thousands of oppressed owner occupiers who are in the circumstances I describe.The Bill does not deal with landlord and tenant law to any significant extent and that is also an area of the law which requires overhauling and codification.  There is a definite need to review all landlord and tenant legislation for the purpose of establishing a clear, simple, consolidated statutory code.  Otherwise the law will be seriously out of touch with modern practice.  Only last week I was consulted about a case where a tenant of 23 years standing was obliged to vacate her apartment on the pretext of necessary repairs and thus contract for new accommodation for 11 months, 11 months being the period that she was told would be needed for the repair and refit of her accommodation.  Without notice, she was then required to return to her original accommodation after only half of the time had elapsed, at a 220% increase in the rent.  If she does not come up with the 220%, if she does not pay off the new landlord to whom she is pledged for 11 months, she will forfeit her original accommodation.  I have no doubt that was the purpose of the exercise.It seems to be public policy to encourage a shift towards apartment living.  If that is the case, the law lags seriously behind in terms of dealing with landlord and tenant law and protecting tenants in the kind of situation I have described.  In that case, a woman who has been in her apartment for 23 years at a particular rent, who has been evicted on the pretext of necessary refurbishment which will take 11 months, had to contract for new living accommodation paying seriously increased rent, only to be told halfway through that if she does not come back to the original accommodation immediately she will forfeit it and that the new rent will be 220% of what she was paying originally.  We are far behind the play in that regard.Historically, Irish law has always been protective of a landowner who has become mentally incapacitated.  There is a high degree of certainty in terms of persons with a disability.  Section 35 seems to bear that out.  However, section 35(2) seems to inject uncertainty into the position and seems to offer less protection for such a vulnerable person.  It leaves it open to a court to consider whether it would be reasonable in all the circumstances to have expected some other person, for example, a trustee or the committee of a ward of court, to have acted on behalf of the incapacitated owner.  It is very difficult to know how this situation might be construed.  What would the test be as to what a court might or might not consider reasonable in these circumstances?An issue that arises from time to time is where one is prevented from carrying out essential repairs to one's property because, in the absence of consent from the adjoining owner, a technical trespass occurs.  At the moment there is a legal vacuum in that regard.  I do not know if I am correct but I understand that when this Bill is enacted a party may go to the District Court for a works order, which should bring clarity to the situation.  It is an issue that most Deputies in this House have encountered in their clinics and a clear answer would be appreciated.Another controversial area that gives rise to disputes between neighbours relates to rights of way and the extinguishment of same.  As the law stands, 20 years abandonment or non-usage would not in itself automatically give rise to extinguishment.  To prove that a right of way over land has been extinguished, it must be proved that the holder of the right not alone has ceased to exercise it for a minimum of 20 years but has also demonstrated a firm intention of not using it again.  It is extremely difficult to prove abandonment, as the case law shows.  Subject to correction by the Minister, the position under the proposed section 37 will be that a right of way is extinguished after 12 years continuous non-usage unless it is protected by registration in the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry.In chapter 12 of this consultation paper from the Law Reform Commission on adverse possession, the commission seems to expect that the opportunity would be taken to deal with this issue.  Perhaps I am reading that incorrectly but it seems that the 2002 report on title by adverse possession of land has not been implemented.  It appears that in a number of areas the law of adverse possession, known as squatter's title, needs to be clarified and improved.  Judges do not always agree as to what amounts to adverse possession in Irish law.  We need a clear, simple definition of adverse possession.  There is a need to end the difference in treatment between tenants who hold under a written tenancy agreement and tenants who do not have a written tenancy agreement when it comes to squatter's title to the property they occupy.  At present, the Statute of Limitations 1957 treats both categories differently.  I fail to see the justification for this difference.Another matter that is not included in the Bill, and that the Minister has avoided, has arisen more frequently in recent years than previously, namely, the question of the right to roam.  My colleague, Deputy Quinn, produced a very thoughtful and innovative way of addressing this issue.  It was also very timely because I believe it caused our vote in the farming community to rise exponentially in the general election.Apart from that consideration, the fact is that there is a real issue to be dealt with and Deputy Quinn's Bill is a thoughtful effort at doing so.  It does not affect land that is capable of being cultivated or land above 500 m sea level.  I take no comfort from the fact that the matter is in the possession of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.  Whatever hope I carry in my heart that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, might bring forward a Bill to curb and regulate property management companies, the prospect of the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, emerging with legislation that will bring the farmers of Ireland in behind the right to roam is very remote.

Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking a nationwide programme of expanding and upgrading station car parks and 17 of these are in the GDA.  New facilities at Leixlip Louisa Bridge and Adamstown were opened already this year and plans are well advanced at Donabate, Rush and Lusk and Sallins.  Upgraded facilities at Gormanstown for 250 cars have also recently been provided.   To date, 800 extra spaces have been provided in the GDA, along with the 200 extra spaces at Sallins which will be opened shortly.  I have approved funding for Iarnród Éireann for a further 600 spaces at three other sites and proposals for a further 500 spaces are being considered by my Department.The park and ride sites on the proposed Luas and metro lines will open simultaneously with the start-up of services.  The extension of the Luas line to Cherrywood will include a park and ride site with 350 spaces at Carrickmines which will open in late 2010.  Proposals from local authorities for rail-based park and ride facilities will also be considered for Transport 21 funding.A DTO report has concluded that bus-based park and ride has a limited role in Dublin because of the city's size and consequent distances.  Nonetheless, where there is a sound business case, my Department will give favourable consideration to funding.  I understand that South Dublin County Council is awaiting the outcome of its application to An Bord Pleanála for permission for a bus-based park and ride facility close to Leixlip.  I am confident that the Transport 21 commitments on park and ride facilities will be comprehensively delivered.

There are no park and ride facilities on the approaches to Dublin from the main motorway between Belfast and Dublin.  If there were such a facility, it would prevent the delays people experience, notwithstanding the option of the port tunnel.  While it is up to the local authorities in theory to make the proposals, we need a Dublin transport authority and a more dynamic team to drive the agenda.  The local authorities are in some cases playing their part, but in other cases they are not doing so.  Will the Minister make it happen?Last week, people were waiting in traffic for an hour, having passed the entrance to the port tunnel, because they could not pay €12 before they got to Whitehall.  If a park and ride option was available, people could take the bus.

There is an emphasis on Transport 21 and some local authorities have been better than others in providing facilities.  When the work starts on the metro and the joining of the Luas lines in the centre of the city, we must ensure we have plenty of park and ride facilities on the outskirts.  I will encourage the local authorities to provide facilities.

In Gormanstown, in the Minister's constituency, Iarnród Éireann is charging for the use of the park and ride facilities.  The taxpayer has paid for them and Iarnród Éireann is hiking up the prices on people who want to use public transport.  It is inequitable to take taxpayers money to build park and ride facilities and then charge for using them.  People who use rail transport are very angry, particularly in the Minister's constituency.  Will he address this issue with Iarnród Éireann and ensure that taxpayers' money is not used to generate more money for itself?  It should be running a more efficient service in any event.

It gives him an issue that he can talk about.  The charges of €2 per day or €5 per week are very modest.  The charges were designed to prevent people using the facilities who were not using the trains.  It is modest and it provides some deterrent, although the evidence is that it does not deter everybody.Over the lifetime of Transport 21, a total of €180 million is available to local authorities for providing park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area.  When the facilities are in place, there is a need to service and maintain them.  One of the principles of the provision of park and ride facilities is that the cost of the facilities should not be added to rail fares.  I am happy that the charges are reasonable.  The facilities offer an incentive and the small charge is a deterrent to those who wish to park but not travel by train.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Government's legal advice is that, having regard to the duties of the board of directors pursuant to the Companies Acts and the memorandum and articles of association of Aer Lingus, shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.  In effect, this means that even if the Government on its own, or in combination with other shareholders, called an EGM, management of Aer Lingus is not obliged to follow any directions from shareholders regarding business matters or to obey any resolution regarding such matters.Regarding the appointment of directors, the State is entitled under the memorandum and articles of association to appoint three directors to the board of Aer Lingus.  Currently, there is one State appointed director serving on the board and it is now proposed that two further appointments will be made in the near future.The State's appointees will seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level.  This will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of each decision and to ensure that the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.  The State appointees to the board do not have a veto on board decisions.  It is not possible for the State to avail of its shareholding to seek to impose non-commercial obligations on the company.With regard to questions raised regarding industrial relations at Aer Lingus, these are matters for the company and the trade unions to address.  The assistance of the industrial relations machinery of the State is regularly used to good effect by both parties and the need to avail of the provisions of section 38 of the Industrial Relations Act does not arise.  I welcome, as I am sure Deputy Broughan does, the recent agreement reached at the LRC between management and Aer Lingus pilots.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Is it not a fact that the Minister seriously misled this House on 26 September 2007 when responding to the debate on Shannon Airport?  I note that the 2006 annual report clearly states on corporate governance that the board is responsible for establishing overall group strategy, including new activities and withdrawal from existing activities.The Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Martin Cullen, knew of the danger to slots at Shannon and possibly at Cork and Dublin since the expansion project.  Is it not clear that Mr. Francis Hackett, the existing governor appointed by the Government, would have known of this expansion plan and would have been duty bound to bring it to the Minister's attention, notwithstanding the presence of directors such as Mr. Chris Wall and Mr. Ivor Fitzpatrick on the board?The Minister now says that the two new directors will receive a mandate to look at regional policy and protect connectivity in Ireland.  Surely that was the existing mandate for Mr. Hackett?  Did the Minister, therefore, mislead the House on the matter during his speech on Shannon?  Either the Minister should resign, with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, or he is leading a totally dysfunctional Department, in which case he should still resign.Is there a management committee structure in the Department?  I certainly could not find any minutes of such a committee on the website.  I shadowed the Minister when he was Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and there was a management committee to which the Minister referred me several times.  Why was this not passed up the line from Mr. John Murphy to the Secretary General to the Minister?On the day he entered the Department, the Minister was given this document, a briefing of all the activities of the Department as of 14 June.  Ms Julie O'Neill kindly gave me a copy when I became Labour Party spokesman on transport.  It refers to a wide range of problems that might arise, but it does not mention the elephant in the room.  Was the Minister not duty bound to ask if there were problems with the ongoing privatisation of Aer Lingus and Shannon Airport?  Did the Minister not fail in that duty and mislead the House and should he not now resign?

The Government, my predecessor and I were always aware when the company was to be privatised that the slots were among the most valuable assets, with staff and aircraft.  We can see the competition for them and we endeavoured in the privatisation to put in place as much of a safeguard as we could to prevent the disposal of the slots.  I am still confident that the rules, regulations, memorandum and articles of association protect the slots from disposal and they have served their purpose.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The Government will seek to ensure that connectivity at Irish airports is maintained and developed through the continued implementation of its aviation strategy, which is to promote the development of as wide a range as possible of competitive international air services to and from Ireland to underpin our economic growth and competitiveness.We need regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world.  To this end, within the European Union, Ireland has consistently supported market liberalisation measures which have served as the platform for the rapid expansion of aviation generally.  We have also promoted liberalisation on a wider basis, most recently in pressing for the conclusion of the EU-US open skies agreement and in concluding a more liberal agreement on a bilateral basis with Canada.I should add that our approach to the encouragement of air services is complemented by our policy on the development of airport infrastructure within the country.  The main objective is to ensure that the three State airports have sufficient capacity to respond to the growth opportunities of a competitive airline sector and to provide vital international access.  In addition, the six regional airports have a key role to play in promoting regional development.It is open to each airport authority to introduce incentive schemes to attract new business, subject to EU competition and state aid rules.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Shannon Airport Authority to introduce a new hub airport incentive scheme to encourage airlines to commence new services to and from Shannon, including Shannon to Heathrow.I have decided to appoint two further directors to the board of Aer Lingus.  I will ask the State appointees to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level.  That will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of each decision and to ensure the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.  The State appointees to the board do not, nor will they, have a veto on board decisions.  All directors, including the State appointees, will be bound by their fiduciary responsibilities under the Companies Acts.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Under company law it is not possible for the State or any other shareholder to overturn a decision taken by the company on day-to-day business matters.  The legal advice to the Government has been clear and unequivocal.  Neither is it possible for the State to avail of its shareholding to seek to impose non-commercial obligations on the company.  By appointing our full board complement it will be possible to seek to ensure that the full ramifications of all significant strategic decisions are fully discussed by the board.The appointment of these extra directors would not have changed the decision on the Shannon to Heathrow service.  The board gave the management a mandate to pursue all commercial opportunities for the airline.  On foot of this mandate, management decided to discontinue the service between Shannon and Heathrow.  It did not have to get the further approval of the board.  The appointment of two extra directors would not have made any difference to this decision.  Even if board approval was a requirement, the emphasis that the company has put on the commercial advantages of Belfast over Shannon suggests that a better understanding of the wider implications for the Shannon region and wider commercial issues for the company would not have tipped the balance in this case.

I asked about the vacant seats on the board of directors of Aer Lingus, but in reply the Minister talked about what the directors will do when they are appointed.  He refused to appoint them when he could have done so and, therefore, when the slots were being discussed, two of the Government seats were vacant and no one could articulate the policy for Shannon, the region or connectivity to Heathrow.It is utterly unbelievable that, while everyone seems to have known about the decision of Aer Lingus; the Dublin Airport Authority knew, the board of Aer Lingus knew, the Department of Transport knew and the Belfast groups knew, the only person who did not know was the Minister.  Not alone did he not know but for 44 days he sat in the Department and no one told him that he was not the mighty Minister, but the mighty mouse.

The board discussed it before the executive went ahead.  The Government seats on the board were vacant.  The vow of omerta of the Government about Aer Lingus was in operation.Did the Taoiseach's monitoring unit, which costs so much and which he praises so highly, not report to him the article in The Examiner on 13 June that stated that Aer Lingus hub plans would mean 1,000 jobs for Belfast and a loss of services in Shannon?  The question is simple.  The Taoiseach’s office must have known about this because it monitors the media, even if the Minister was unaware of it.  Was the Minister informed and, if not, why not?The Minister is incompetent, he has failed in his duty of care and has shown an incredible lack of competence.  He should tell the whole truth now.

As far back as the IPO launch and the documentation for it, it was made clear that an expansion of Aer Lingus was envisaged and that at least there would be one other hub.  Even on 13 June it was generally known that Aer Lingus was examining possibilities for other hubs.  The Deputy is confusing the issue that all the slots were going to be taken from Shannon for that particular hub, which was not known.

Safety is a fundamental consideration in the provision and maintenance of the national and non-national road networks.  As such, safety issues are built in to the processes of planning, design, operation and maintenance of the roads systems.  As part of my responsibility for road safety policy, I have a keen interest in ensuring road transport infrastructure and services are provided, managed and used in a manner that protects people from death and injury.The National Roads Authority funds an extensive programme of engineering works with the aim of improving road safety and dealing with accident black spots on national roads.  My Department provides funding for local authorities for the same purposes in respect of non-national roads.  Ongoing responsibility for the monitoring, review and enhancement of the safety of specific road infrastructure rests with the National Roads Authority and the relevant local authorities.

The key to this is the necessity for an overseeing body to ensure equal standards apply throughout the country.  I apologise for the error, as this question should have been put by Deputy McEntee, although my name appears on it.  He has made a strong play on this issue, particularly in County Meath.  We are seeking a six point road safety plan.  Does the Minister agree that, in keeping with international best practice, there should be a safety audit of roads?  An independent authority such as the Road Safety Authority should undertake such an audit which cannot be left in the hands of those who do the work to be audited.  An independent audit is required.

A disagreement arises — if one wishes to call it that — in asking the Road Safety Authority to fulfil that role.  I am satisfied with the role played by the authority, as well as by local authorities and council engineering staff.  I do not want to comment on a specific case, but the Health and Safety Authority has been involved, even though it is probably acting ultra vires.  An amount of work is being done on road safety, including road design.  Arising from the HSA’s interventions, new guidelines are being put in place.  Other issues will arise from the road safety strategy, including that of soft engineering.  The Garda Síochána now has a forensic unit and every accident location is treated as a crime scene.  The information is fed into the system since it is important to have access to information on a combination of all these aspects.  At this point, I would not like to distract the Road Safety Authority from its important job, otherwise it may have to acquire a range of skills it may not have, but I will keep the matter under review.

I would not expect the authority to take on more staff.  However, the key point is that 33% of deaths on the roads are due to poor road surfaces and bad signage.The issue concerning the Health and Safety Authority is an important one.  The authority is involved because of the work done by people employed there.  The budgets of many counties do not permit all necessary works to be undertaken in line with new standards.  More investment is required to provide for better roadworks, better management and, in particular, an independent auditing system.

A modern deep-water port such as that to be constructed at Bremore is critical for the infrastructural development of the country.  I will fully support the proposed legislation.  When does the Minister intend to bring it before the House?  I understand it will take approximately one year for Drogheda Port Company to go through the required process, having received commitments from the Department of Transport yesterday or the day before.

I propose to seek early Government approval for the drafting of the Bill and I intend to pursue its enactment as quickly as possible.The joint venture will help to promote competition while relieving congestion at Dublin Port.  This proposal is being advanced as a standalone project and is not dependent on, or linked to, any relocation of capacity from Dublin Port.Earlier this month, Dublin City Council launched an eight week public consultation period on the report of its Dublin Bay study.  That study's report looks at a wide range of economic, amenity, recreational and environmental issues linked to Dublin Bay, including the port area.  The national development plan, NDP, indicates that the Government will undertake a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the national spatial strategy and national economic policy.Dublin City Council has indicated that its Dublin Bay study is aimed at launching a public debate.  The council will submit the findings of its report and any public submissions it receives thereon to me for consideration as part of the NDP study, which I intend to initiate shortly.  I have no plans to issue a Green Paper on the future of Dublin Port.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I welcome the Minister's initiative in this area because it has major implications and possibilities for Dublin North where it will be located.  Will the Minister use the opportunity afforded by the harbours Bill to ensure that provision is made to avoid the situation that has arisen in Skerries Harbour where dredgers have been abandoned and left for several months at a time?  There will also be a significant opportunity to exploit the tourism potential of the area.  The introduction of car ferries might also be considered, as well as the possibility of creating a marina at Balbriggan Harbour.The Minister said that this is a standalone project but I know he agrees with my suggestion that this development not take place in isolation but that there will be proper connectivity, including an outer orbital road which will draw traffic away from the port, to Navan, Trim and Naas to connect with other roadways.  The people of Balbriggan have recently suffered enough excessive development, without the contingent infrastructure.  I hope that the Minister for Transport will use his good offices and influence with his fellow Ministers to ensure that we get the educational, law and order and other facilities that the people of Dublin North, particularly Balbriggan, so badly need.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I welcome the announcement about the development of the new port at Bremore and I met the Minister a few years ago about this matter.  I hope, however, that he has uppermost in his mind the traffic impact on the town of Balbriggan of a vast new port which is destined to become a significant small city.  I support the last speaker's comments on this subject.Will the Minister say categorically that he has no plans to move Dublin Port?  He has decided that there will be no Green Paper but he is waiting for a report from Dublin City Council.  Dublin Port, however, is the country's major port, through which 80% of its ro-ro traffic passes.  It is vital to our trade that it continues to be healthy.  Does the Minister agree with the chief executive, Enda Connellan, that the Irish Continental Group's 33 acre site in Dublin dock has no development value?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I thank Deputy Reilly for bringing me on a tour of his constituency and the various issues arising there.  All the matters raised in respect of the ports, the abandonment of dredgers and so on, can be taken into account.  Legislation exists to deal with these matters but is probably not effective.  During the election campaign I was shown what is happening there.  The harbours Bill will provide an opportunity for us to see if that can be improved.Before a major port such as Bremore can be developed it must go through a full planning process which must take into account its effect on traffic and the neighbourhood generally.  Unless there is sufficient road and rail infrastructure to the port there will be little point in providing it.  I am interested in advancing the outer orbital route.  It would be important from the economic and environmental points of view.Dublin Port Company is a semi-State company that operates like other companies we have discussed and no doubt will discuss later, and makes its own decisions.  I will not direct it on the commercial decisions it must make.  The study aims to take into account the port and its place in Dublin.  The Deputy is right to say that it is crucial to our economic growth and development.  A significant amount of our trade goes through Dublin Port.  It does, however, need further capacity but I do not intend to decide on its location.

As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Act 1993, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.Both Transport 21 and the national development plan committed the NRA to carrying out a feasibility study on the orbital route.  Earlier this year, the NRA completed an updated feasibility study which built on a 2001 study which considered, in particular, the costs and benefits of such a route.  The updated NRA study finds that there is merit in constructing an orbital route linking Drogheda, Navan and Naas.  As part of the study, various possible route corridors were examined in detail.  A corridor linking Drogheda to Navan to Naas was identified as the optimum route having regard to the policy objectives set out in the various policy documents on the route.  There are no plans to extend the route through the Wicklow Mountains to Arklow or Gorey.Neither Transport 21 nor the national development plan provide any funding for the scheme to be brought through planning and preliminary design or to construction in the period to 2015.  The study is under detailed consideration within my Department.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Does the Minister not appreciate that there is considerable concern in Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow at the Government proposal for an outer orbital route that does not complete the orbit but ends at Naas?The south east has already experienced certain difficulties in economic development and employment.  Does the Minister agree that this area would lose out badly if it is not included in this major infrastructural development? Will he reconsider the exclusion of the last leg of the orbital?  Will the Government accept in principle that there is an issue for the south east and that it is important that a connection be made to the N11?  Will the Minister talk to people in the NRA about the very dangerous section of the N11 between The Tap pub and The Beehive pub?  This section will take more lives unless action is taken to upgrade it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The Government is not proposing this outer orbital yet.  It is for consideration in the programme for Government.  The report commissioned by the NRA is still under consideration.  Any proposal that comes forward will be from the NRA, and it would then have to be accepted by the Government.I think the Deputy recognises the reason the route is as such is largely due to the technical difficulties in trying to get through the barrier of the Wicklow mountains.  I do not accept that if the outer orbital is provided and the remaining leg is left out, this will cause a major disadvantage to the south east in terms of roads.  There will be two major routes to the south east along the east coast and to Waterford.  The south east will be well served by a good road network.  The other part of the equation, but slightly further back in planning, is the study on what was always called the eastern bypass.  The bypass would continue from the port tunnel and would be another major advantage to County Wicklow.  Both of these will be looked at together.  Wicklow will not lose out as a result of decisions that were taken.I acknowledge what the Deputy said about the N11.  We have had much correspondence from almost every Deputy and councillor from Wicklow on this issue.  I have taken it on board and I have raised the issue with the NRA.  It is dangerous and about €27 million has been spent on it, but it would be desirable if we could move it forward very quickly.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I appreciate that, but I urge the Minister to keep dealing with that issue which is so fundamentally important.  I ask him not to exclude the last leg of the outer orbital on the basis that the Wicklow mountains are in the way.  It has been proposed that the road could skirt the southern end of the mountains, but if that does not happen, the south east of Ireland will be at a great disadvantage.  There will be no linkage between the N11 and the new Waterford road, which is where the problem lies.

The Minister states today that it is not being proposed.  Is it not true that the Green Party is opposed to this?  Deputy Cuffe, as chairperson of the Green Party transport committee, is opposed to this route and there is disagreement in Cabinet about this.  Let us have the facts.  It was not included in the national development plan and it is not in Transport 21.  The Taoiseach stated that it would be built, but the Minister has stated otherwise and the Green Party is opposed to it.  The Minister also stated that he would build Bremore Port and we need that very badly.  Infrastructure around Dublin will collapse if we do not have this outer orbital route.

I corrected her and stated that the NRA was proposing the route.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank Members for their questions.  Hopefully I will be able to clarify this matter as there appears to be some confusion among them.A media article on 13 June 2007 reported the possibility of Aer Lingus opening a new base at Belfast.  Aer Lingus confirmed that a number of possible locations were being considered.  Following a query to the company by my Department on foot of that article, the company, on 13 June, indicated it was considering the opening of a new base at Belfast and that, were the proposal to proceed, there would be implications for Shannon.  An official conveyed the Department's concerns from the perspective of aviation and regional policy regarding the implications for Shannon and asked the chief executive to give full consideration to the ways in which a new base might be accommodated before arriving at a decision, which he agreed to do.  The matter was not brought to my attention.Subsequently, an official of the Department contacted Aer Lingus on 27 July arising from a query to the company on industrial relations matters.  Again, it should be noted that contact was initiated by my Department.  In the course of that conversation, it was confirmed that the company's plans for a new base had solidified and that a formal announcement was to be made on 8 August.  It was also confirmed that opening the new Belfast base would entail the reallocation of Shannon to Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008.  The official expressed concern regarding the impact of the loss of a Shannon to Heathrow service from an aviation and regional policy perspective, emphasised the importance of Aer Lingus's commitment to Shannon and indicated that these matters would be raised with the chief executive of the company.In an e-mail to my private office on 27 July, the official stated the company intended to announce the new Belfast base on 8 August, which would entail the reallocation of Shannon to Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008, and referred to the concerns he had raised.  A meeting with the chairman and the chief executive was arranged for the earliest opportunity, that is 3 August, to enable me to discuss these matters with the company.  At the meeting on 3 August with the chairman and chief executive of Aer Lingus, I was informed of the decision to open a hub in Belfast and the reallocation of all the Shannon to Heathrow slots to a new Belfast to Heathrow service.A number of Deputies have asked questions regarding the period between 13 June and 27 July.  It is important to make clear that officials were keenly aware that the company was in an offer period until the end of June, which meant that information obtained from the company had to be treated with absolute confidentiality.  Even outside an offer period, the rules related to quoted companies impose tight confidentiality requirements relating to price-sensitive information.  Aer Lingus did not indicate until late July that it had made a final decision.  When contact was made in June, no decision had been taken and the company had agreed to reflect on the concerns raised by the Department.As has been pointed out repeatedly in recent weeks, Aer Lingus is free to make such commercial decisions.  It was clear from early August that the company was steadfast in its decision although the implications for Shannon had been brought to its attention and, as it stated, had been considered fully by it.  Although the deeply-felt concerns of business and tourism interests in Shannon are well understood, it remains the case that Aer Lingus has not been convinced that there is a commercial case to reverse its decision.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Will the Minister acknowledge that a document existed within his Department on 13 June that was marked for the attention of the Minister and that indicated specifically this concern?  Can the Minister comment on, or explain, how the document did not reach him?  This is the crux of the matter.Does the Minister seriously expect Members to believe that during the one and a half months in question, no one informed him, the Government, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea?  This is despite the fact that the issue had been brought to the attention of his officials, who considered it sufficiently serious to warrant contacting the chief executive of Aer Lingus.  Does the Minister seriously expect Members or the people to believe this to be the case?  I find it to be incredible.Will the Minister hold an independent investigation into this matter rather than an internal departmental investigation?  Clearly, both departmental officials and the Minister are directly implicated in this business.  It is essential to have an independent investigation into this matter.Given the issue regarding corporate governance raised earlier today by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, in Priority Question No. 2, will the Minister ask his two board members to raise as a matter of urgency at board level the need to re-investigate the entire issue pertaining to the withdrawal of the Shannon to Heathrow slots?  The company's corporate governance documents state that the board is responsible for overall group strategy, including new activities and withdrawal from existing activities.The Minister should respond to these four direct, clear questions.  The people of the mid-west are horrified that this information was available, the decision could have been pre-empted and an alternative decision could have been agreed with the Government, had the Minister and his Department done their jobs.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Broughan.  The buck stops with the Minister and he should consider seriously his position as Minister for Transport.

There was, and the document in question was released under freedom of information legislation.  As the Deputy noted, it was headed, "For the information of the Minister".  Neither I nor my predecessor ever received that document.  While everyone within the Department accepts I should have been informed of the document's contents and should have received it, I was not so informed and did not receive it.

I find it completely unbelievable that he can state he did not see anything, hear anything or know anything.  Neither his press office, his advisers nor his programme managers told him anything.  I wish to ask the Minister a question in respect of the Taoiseach.Is it not a fact that there is a media watch unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and that the Taoiseach, as he said on the record of the House, circulates media reports to the relevant Departments?  Did the Minister receive such a report from the Taoiseach?  The reports are here and the Minister could have seen them himself if he had done a Google search.  They are on the Irish Independent and Irish Examiner websites.My second question is about the credibility of the Minister.  He seems to be saying that members of the Dublin Airport Authority, the Aer Lingus board, the Belfast groups, and the Department of Transport — at the level of assistant secretary — all knew about this issue and were talking about it, yet none of them spoke to the Minister about it.  Nobody told the Minister anything.  It is as though he were in an isolated cell where nobody could communicate with him.  I would have expected the Minister to meet with people such as these, including the aviation experts and the assistant secretaries, on his first day in office to find out about any big issues that would have to be faced.  Were they not there?  I would have expected him to find out about the matters that would affect him, the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and the other members of the Cabinet.  It is not credible for the Minister to say that he did not know.  I do not accept that, nor will anyone on this side of the House.  Deputy Dempsey has been a Minister for ten years in at least four different Departments.  He has no credibility on this issue.  I ask him again.  Did the Taoiseach's media unit contact him or his Department about this issue?

I am not sure how many people here knew, but it was public knowledge that at least five different centres were being considered, including Belfast, Birmingham and Glasgow.  In the story that appeared on 13 June, it was stated that Belfast was a likely choice.  It was not stated that all the slots would be removed from Shannon Airport——

Surely he would have asked whether there were any issues regarding the privatisation of Aer Lingus that needed to be brought to his attention.  The memo he received was dated 13 June.  He took over as Minister on 14 June.  I expect the memorandum was prepared before he went in as Minister, and he would have been given a separate briefing on this issue.  Did the former Minister, Deputy Cullen, brief the Minister on Aer Lingus and the Heathrow slots?The Minister received information on 27 July to the effect that his Department had known since 13 June that Aer Lingus was considering pulling the Shannon to Heathrow slots.  At that stage did the Minister not consider appointing two directors to the board with a mandate to protect the Heathrow slots?  Does he agree that if he had appointed the directors back on 14 June when he took over as Minister we would not be in this situation now?  The Heathrow slots in Shannon would have been protected.When did the Taoiseach become aware of the proposed decision of Aer Lingus?  When did the Minister first discuss it with the Taoiseach?  These are critical matters.  What the Minister is presenting here today does not stand up to scrutiny.  Clearly, the Government knew as far back as 13 June that the decision was to be made, and it could have made certain it would not happen.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I will go through this one more time.  The official who saw the information in the newspaper on 13 June tried himself to make contact with Aer Lingus to establish the truth of the matter.  He was unable to make contact directly.  Another official was asked to do it because the first official had a number of meetings that morning.  The second official made contact with a person in Aer Lingus and had a conversation, which he recorded and placed in the memo of 13 June.  In case people are becoming confused, I will mention that this was the principal officer.  In the meantime the other official, the assistant secretary, made contact with or was contacted by — I cannot say which — somebody in the company, who told him——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	328	On a point of information, when the Minister first gave an explanation he said quite clearly that his Department made contact with Aer Lingus, not vice versa.  Now he is saying he is not sure who made contact with whom.  Could he clarify this, please?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The official made an attempt to ring the chief executive of Aer Lingus in the morning——

He told the principal officer to make contact, which was initiated.  There was a conversation.  I do not want to be accused of misleading the House, because I am not sure of this, but there was a conversation in the afternoon between the assistant secretary and the chief executive of Aer Lingus in which the information about the Belfast hub was conveyed.  He was told that Belfast was one of a number of places being considered but that no final decision had been made, and that there could be implications for Shannon if it was chosen.  The assistant secretary indicated what he knew to be Government policy——

As I said, the next contact was initiated by the Department on 27 July.  To answer the specific question again, neither that conversation nor the memo was brought to my attention.

I assume the answer to that is "Yes" or "No".  Was the Minister offered such a briefing?  Did he ask for one, and if not, why?  Did he discuss any matter related to Aer Lingus with officials in his Department prior to 27 July, and if so, with whom did he discuss them?Why will he not ask an independent body rather than an internal departmental inquiry to investigate these matters?  Who is running the Department of Transport?  Is it the Minister with responsibility or is it the Civil Service?  The Government at the time blamed Aer Lingus management for removing the Shannon-Heathrow slots, describing it as regrettable.  It now seems that the Minister is blaming the Civil Service for that.Would the Minister accept that, had he acted properly with management in a timely fashion from early June, such an intervention could have led to a much better solution, salvaging the Shannon-Heathrow slots and thereby offering significant infrastructure to that part of this island?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I will try to be brief.  On 14 June Deputy Dempsey became Minister for this, his fourth Department.  He is an extremely experienced politician at this stage.  He got a written briefing from his Department, which we have seen, containing a section on the Shannon tourism and economic development and another section on the development of Shannon Airport.  Is he seriously expecting us to believe that he got that written briefing but that he got no verbal briefing relating to those two sections——

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	351	——or whether he could go on holidays safe in the knowledge that the biggest political story of the summer was not about to break?  Is it reasonable to be sceptical when, the day before he got this briefing, the second in command in his Department was so concerned about a political story that was about to break that he rang Mr. Dermot Mannion, chief executive of Aer Lingus, yet the following day, despite the fact that the Minister would have been required to ask questions about his written briefing, nobody chose to mention this?This is not the Opposition looking for a political opportunity.  Pure and simple, it is that we do not believe what the Minister is saying.  That is why these questions have been tabled.  It is not credible.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I do not believe the Minister either.  I want to establish when the Taoiseach was informed of all this.  Was he informed, like the Minister, on 13 June?  The Minister was informed on that date, he was briefed by his official and he washed his hands of it.  He did not act and he turned his back on Shannon.I want to know when the Government found out about this and when all the officials knew about it.  The Minister has turned his back on us.  He has sold out the people of Shannon and he must be held accountable for that.

Were other Departments informed?

Broughan — the need to address the decision of the HSE to withdraw funding for new bed facilities at the Hamilton Park Nursing Home in Balrothery, Balbriggan, on 3 October last where citizens, including a senior constituent who is a stroke patient and currently in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, have been arbitrarily deprived of much-needed care and treatment; (5) Deputy Chris Andrews — the measures proposed to tackle the odour problem occurring in Dublin South-East as a result of the waste water treatment plant; (6) Deputy Jan O'Sullivan — the disclosure that the Department of Transport was aware of plans by Aer Lingus to scrap its Shannon-Heathrow routes and transfer the service to Belfast six weeks before the Minister for Transport claims to have been made aware of the proposal and the need to outline why the Government took no action in regard to such a major threat to job creation and economic investment in the west and mid-western region; (7) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enact the Judicial Council Bill without delay; and (8) Deputy Alan Shatter — the subject matter of Question No. 257 of Wednesday, 17 October 2007.The matters raised by Deputies Damien English, Ruairí Quinn, Tony Gregory and Chris Andrews have been selected for discussion.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I am delighted to raise this serious matter on the Adjournment.  I take it that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is dealing with this as I note that once again the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is not here because she is denying these facts.  It is disgraceful that the Minister for Health and Children and the Government are downplaying this serious issue.  The Minister's take on it is nothing short of a con job.Why must the patients of the north-east region suffer because of Government cutbacks?  We were promised this would not happen.  In May, before the election, the Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated there would be no cutbacks to frontline staff.  In September and October when they were asked about cutbacks they stated no patients would suffer.The north-east regional orthopaedic unit will close for a month.  This unit serves a population of 400,000.  It does on average 200 operations a month.  The Minister is trying to dispute that, saying it does only six.  According to her own figures yesterday, she admitted that the unit has looked after 16,000 patients in the first nine months.  If one divides that number by nine, one gets 177 patients, which is much more than six.  It is an insult to the people of the north east and to this country that the Minister keeps speaking of the figure six.  It is a disgrace.  I want that confirmed and I want her to come in here at some stage and admit that she was misleading people with that figure.  Her own regional organiser employed by the HSE, which reports to the Government, has admitted publicly that the figure is approximately 180.  The consultants have stated it is approximately 180.  Who does the Minister think she is to continue misleading us by telling us lies, that the figure is six, which is wrong?

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	384	Deputy Quinn is correct.  It is better to say it was deliberately wrong.  This unit will close for a month, which will affect people scheduled for treatment in December, but it will also have a knock-on effect on every month during 2008.  Each of the approximately 500 patients on the waiting list will suffer because of this cutback.  It is wrong and deliberately untrue to continue saying only six people will be affected.  Many more people will be affected.  These patients will be left in serious pain.Why were the consultants not informed when the decision was taken to close this unit?  It is a disgrace that consultants who know how much pain patients are suffering were not even consulted about the closure of the unit.  How is it safe for patients for someone to decide at the stroke of a pen to close this unit?  This is a disgrace.I accept the Minister may not have all the answers today but I have some questions to put to him.  Why were the consultants not consulted on this serious decision?  Why are the patients the ones who will suffer due to cutbacks when we were promised they would not?  Does the Minister care about Our Lady's Hospital in Navan or this orthopaedic unit?I did not receive any answers in the Minister's replies to parliamentary questions I tabled in recent days.  She informed me it is not her responsibility.  What exactly is the Minister for Health and Children supposed to do if not be in charge of our hospitals?  It is ridiculous to say it is not her responsibility.  Will the Government step in and prevent the closure of this unit?  Will the Minister accept the figure of six patients is incorrect and totally and utterly misleading?  Will the unit be fully operational in January?If the unit is closed in December, no pre-operation assessment cases can be dealt with, so no patients will be ready for operation in January.  In effect, this would result in two months of closure, which would be very serious.  I seek clarification on this point.  How much money does the Minister for Health and Children intend to save by closing the unit for a month?  When a manager is absent due to illness, he or she can be replaced by a memo sent around the health service to find a replacement.  A manager can be replaced but in this case it appears a unit must be closed.Last April or May, prior to the election, we were promised in a big announcement by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that Our Lady's Hospital, Navan was due to get a medical assessment unit which would solve the problems experienced by the casualty department.  We were promised it would open in July 2007 but construction has not even started yet and it is not due to open until 2008.  This is another promise on which we have been let down.We were also led to believe the medical assessment unit would be a permanent one but we have learned since the initial announcement that it is an interim unit which will close in 2009.  Why are the people of the north east expected by the Government to accept a second-class health service?  This is not good enough.  People are suffering and will continue to suffer.  What does the Government intend to do?I have respect for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, but I no longer respect the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, since she got her figures wrong.  I hope the Minister will bring the message to the Government that the north east can no longer endure constant cutbacks.Since the election three announcements have been made about Navan Hospital: first, the closure of this unit; second, that there would be no medical assessment unit; and third, the withdrawal of cancer services.  I am convinced all this information was available prior to the election.  It was misleading and a con job not to have told people the truth in the north east.  For years the people there have suffered from a lack of investment in the health service, yet they are expected to continue accepting the situation.  This is not good enough.It was confirmed during the week by the Health Service Executive's regional network manager that many vacant posts in the north east were not filled in 2007.  Therefore, the current cutbacks do not look as bad as they would otherwise have.  We do not appear to have to cut back as much as is actually the case.  Posts were deliberately not filled in order to save money and it was decided to postpone the bad news regarding cutbacks for November and December.  We need answers.

This excludes accident and emergency services.  I say this to illustrate the high levels of service that continue to be offered in our public hospitals.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I acknowledge the presence in the House of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  I appreciate that she has chosen to reply to this matter, as in my experience this has not necessarily been the practice.The measure of any good bureaucracy is its ability to be both consistent and flexible at the same time.  The allocation of resources, especially public resources, must respect the taxpayer and be fair in terms of distribution, especially when there are so many competing demands.  The allocation of an additional primary school teacher to existing school is a good example of what I mean.The system has worked well in St. Mary's boys national school in Haddington Road.  Advance notice in spring 2007 of an increase in numbers resulted in the Department indicating to the school that it would be entitled to take on an extra teacher, which it duly did.  In order to do so a classroom was found within the building, but this led to the closure of a pre-school group which affected many parents of children already in the school and others, and the redundancy of two pre-school teachers whose redundancy payments had to be funded out of the internal resources fund-raised by the school, which went for non-visible expenditure.By the end of September this year, under the bureaucratic system I described with some praise, which I mean, the school properly informed the statistical unit within the Department it was three pupils short of the total number of extra children required.  In this instance the unit in question replied that it operated on a numerical basis but an appeals procedure existed.  I address this appeal to the Minister who recently visited the school.  When she had a brief word with the principal in question, Liam Ó Frighil, he brought the matter to her attention.  She may not recall the details as she is a busy person.The net point of this appeal is the following.  We know five extra children will be in the school by Christmas.  The school caters for a large section of newcomers, as the school describes these foreign nationals.  I will not use the term non-Irish population which is a most insulting designation of people.  The Minister may have had a chance to read the documentation sent to her Department which outlines that many of them are people who have come here to ensure the Celtic tiger continues to work.  Three of the young children who will arrive in the school before Christmas are Filipinos.  They are the sons of people who are making our health system work.  By Christmas the school will have the required numbers to meet the understandable criteria that have been set by the Minister and her predecessors in the Department.  I urge her to exercise the discretion she possesses to look at the details of the files in her Department, which I do not propose to go into given the time constraints, and to ensure that this happens.  The consequence of not doing so is the internal disruption of the school.  The Minister will know what that means as she is a professional teacher.  It will give rise to mixed classes.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, who shares a constituency with me will share my concern that the closure of the pre-school and the non-appearance of the extra school teacher will be blamed on the newcomers and their children.  That will have a negative effect which none of us wishes to see.  I should have acknowledged the presence of another Dublin South-East Member, Deputy Chris Andrews from Fianna Fáil who is seated behind the Minister.We all know the good work done by both the girls school and boys school.  The boys come from junior and senior infants into the boys school.  I ask that the Minister read the file of the case carefully and make the decision the three Deputies present would wish her to make.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and thank the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and Deputy Andrews for being present.  As noted by Deputy Quinn, I met the school principal in the forecourt of the girls school, which I was visiting, and he outlined the situation raised by Deputy Quinn, namely, that new students will be arriving at the school.  The school is part of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, disadvantage programme, which is an inclusive programme that for the first time draws together schools, pre-schools and second level schools in an integrated programme.  We have all recognised in the past that funding needs to be focused on the most disadvantaged, which is happening for the first time in DEIS, rather than having a scattered approach where funding is spread among too many schools.St. Mary's boys national school, Haddington Road, is in band 2 of DEIS but it is as a result of its previous participation in the Giving Children an Even Break programme that it qualified for the class sizes allocation, which is 20:1 in the junior classes and 27:1 in the senior classes.  This obviously allows for the allocation of additional posts.There is a very objective system for the allocation of teachers.

It works on the following basis.  There are 4,000 schools in the country.  Traditionally, the only way teachers were allocated was on the basis of numbers on 30 September of the preceding year.  Given increasing population and school numbers, we then introduced allocation on the basis of projected numbers.  It was on this basis that St. Mary's boys national school made its submission and was allocated the teaching post.  I was not aware it had shut down a pre-school, nor am I aware from where it got the money to pay for the two pre-school teachers — I am sure it did not come from its capitation or DEIS funding.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The allocation was made on the condition it would reach the required enrolment by 30 September 2007.  The school wrote to the Department stating it had not reached the enrolment.Notwithstanding this, there is an independent appeals process.  There are two times when this adjudication panel meets: the first is when the original allocations are made early in the summer and the second when schools apply for a review in the first week of October, as I understand it.  The independent panel is genuinely independent of the Department of Education and Science and the Minister.  Were any Minister to get involved with an individual school, not only would the Minister have 4,000 schools coming after him or her, but 165 Deputies, 60 Senators and everyone else would do so also.  That would not be an objective way to allocate teachers.The allocations are not made on the basis that the pupils are newcomers or do not have English as a first language.  There are classes throughout west County Dublin which hardly have native-born Irish pupils due to arrival of many newcomers.  Teachers are not allocated on that basis.I suggested to the principal of the boys school that he should indicate increased numbers were arriving and that he knew this for a fact.  He indicated to me that the class guidelines under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme would be broken but that he still would not have very large classes when compared to others.  However, he is making his appeal on the basis of newcomers arriving and the fact that he genuinely thought he would have them.  Many schools——

Teachers are employed in different schools on the basis of a panel.  It is a good system that has worked well given 28,000 primary teachers are now employed.The principal's appeal will be considered on 23 October, which is next week.  I hope he will be successful in that.

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for being present.  I understand the Minister is considering a request from the Ward Union hunt for a licence to hunt domesticated deer with packs of hounds.  I have a number of concerns which I hope the Minister will consider when making his decision.I am aware the Attorney General has given the view that because section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976 refers to a licence to hunt deer, this reference alone makes it irrelevant whether the deer are wild or domesticated.  However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the alternative view that the Wildlife Act 1976 in its entirety, in particular the part which contains section 26, deals exclusively with wild animals and the reference to "deer" is of course intended to refer to wild deer, not farmed, domesticated deer.  It is, after all, a Wildlife Act, a point I hope the Minister will accept.I draw attention to the report of the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry's veterinary inspector, Mr. K. W. S. Kane, originally obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, of which I then placed a copy in the Oireachtas Library.  Mr. Kane's report states: "As the Red Deer at Green Park are obviously not wild animals it is equally hard to see how they fall into the ambit of the Wildlife Act, 1976 which specifically refers to ‘Wildlife' defined therein as meaning ‘fauna and flora', the word ‘fauna' being further defined as meaning ‘wild animals'."  The Department inspector, an expert in his field, also states: "As the Red Deer herd ... [has been] maintained in captivity [by the Ward Union hunt] for something in the region of 150 years and is augmented regularly by stock from captive herds farmed solely for venison production, it is hard to see how they avoid falling into the category of ‘domestic animal' for the purposes of the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965."  The inspector's conclusion is as follows: "It could be argued ... that the stags are domestic animals and do not fall within the ambit of the Wildlife Act, 1976 and thus that the hunts contravene the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965."It was for the same reason that in the same year, 1997, the department of agriculture in the North, having taken legal and veterinary advice, decided to regard such deer as domestic animals and hunting them as an act of cruelty.  It proceeded to outlaw the practice in the North.In a Dáil reply to me yesterday, the Minister stated the Department has never granted a wildlife dealer's licence to the Ward Union hunt, despite the fact it maintains a large herd of red deer.  Surely this is further evidence that we are not dealing with wild animals but farmed, domestic, tame animals.  If so, let us examine what happens to them during the hunt.  For the sake of accuracy, I will quote directly from the Department inspector's report, where he refers to stags being terrified, apparently distressed and exhausted, and concludes the hunt "must be terrifying and stressful to the animal".  My case is that there must be, at the very least, a serious concern that the hunting with packs of hounds of these tame, domesticated deer causes unnecessary suffering to the animals and must therefore be in breach of the Protection of Animals Act 1911.I have been present to monitor the activities of the Ward Union Hunt and witnessed Mr. Bailey, Mr. Ronan and others like them at their entertainment.  In terror of the hounds, the deer frantically tries to stay in front of them but, being in unfamiliar territory, the route is hazardous and it crashes through hedges, jumps over walls and ditches, crosses busy roads and even runs down busy streets.  It is a gruelling ordeal which can last for up to three hours and result in tears, bruises, bites, lameness and exhaustion.Veterinary documents obtained by the Irish Council Against Blood Sports under the Freedom of Information Act have exposed some of the fatalities arising from the Ward Union Hunt's activities, including a deer which died as a result of fractured ribs, two deer which died from ruptured aortic aneurysms, a deer which drowned in a quarry and a deer which collapsed and died after desperately trying to escape over an 8 ft. high wall.  When the animal becomes so depleted it can no longer run, hunt members move in to tackle it violently to the ground.I hope the Minister will consider the issues I have raised, as he must clearly recognise that this activity involves terrifying an animal unnecessarily, which is in breach of the Protection of Animals Act.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this matter.  Section 26(1) of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, provides that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may grant to the master or other person in charge of a pack of stag hounds a licence authorising the hunting of deer by that pack during such period as specified in the licence.  I know there are different views as to whether activities of the Ward Union Hunt are licensable, given that the deer owned by the hunt are considered domesticated animals.  Accordingly, my Department obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General which confirms the previous interpretation of section 26, to the effect that this section provides for the licensing of carted deer hunting irrespective of the status of the deer, wild or captive.The Ward Union Hunt made an application to my Department in August 2007 for a licence under section 26 for the coming season.  My Department wrote to the hunt on 10 September advising that I was considering not granting a licence to the hunt due to serious concerns relating to conservation and the protection of stags generally and failure to comply with previous licence conditions.  I am aware that Deputy Gregory has attended hunt meetings as an observer.  Officials of my Department then met with representatives of the Ward Union Hunt on 18 September and strong concerns put to the hunt representatives were discussed.  Subsequently, the Ward Union Hunt responded by letter of 28 September.I wish to see a number of issues clarified with the Ward Union Hunt and my Department will write to the hunt shortly.  Following a further response from the hunt on these issues, I will be in a position to make a decision on the licence application.Animal welfare and legal protection of animals from cruelty are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a comprehensive animal welfare Bill, which will update existing legislation to ensure the welfare of animals is properly protected and penalties for offenders are increased significantly.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment and thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss the issue.  He is obviously conscious of the difficulties being created by the waste water treatment plant in Ringsend, which cost €300 million to construct.  I am not convinced by claims that the plant has delivered an improvement in water quality around Sandymount and Dublin Bay.  Those who walk along the strand, from the Tara Towers up to the Poolbeg Peninsula, will have noted what appears to be a serious rat infestation in the area.  I am not keen to bring children to the area and having visited the strand a couple of times over the summer, I decided not to return such was the number of rats.  I am not convinced the plant has provided a panacea for the poor quality of water in the area.An e-mail sent to me recently by residents in the Sandymount area states:As you will be aware the odour from the sewage plant has been a major imposition on the residents of much of Dublin South East for the past few years.  We have taken up this matter with Matt Twomey Assistant City Manager and were assured that the problem would be solved by late November by installing a higher quality of dryers and covers on the sewage tanks.  Two weeks ago we wrote to Mr Twomey to ask him if the installation of the dryers was on schedule (we had been told in July that the first of three dryers would be installed in August, another in October and the last in November). The reply received last week informed us that these improvements will now not be in place until some time in 2008. No target date in 2008 was given.The odour on Friday night last (Oct.12) was the most vile and noxious to date. It was so bad in our area that my wife thought that there was a gas leak!  Given the amount of time that the City Council have had to date to fix this problem and the fact that they cannot now even keep to their own remedy schedule we believe that it is now time for the government to intervene.Before his appointment, the Minister, referring to problems with the plant, called on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to "conduct its own investigation and reveal who is responsible for this cock-up".  I appreciate, therefore, that he understands the gravity of the situation.  Around this time last year, the Minister also asked when someone would be held accountable for the problem.  It appears no one will be held to account for this engineering and public relations disaster by Dublin City Council, which has affected the quality of life of people living in the area.  While water quality may have improved, air quality has been particularly poor in the years since the plant was constructed.People have given up telephoning Dublin City Council's complaints department because they have had enough and no longer have faith in the council.  My office has tried to contact Dublin City Council in recent days but to no avail.  Why would a member of the public bother his or her backside to contact the council when public representatives are unable to do so?The Minister must ensure someone is held to account and made to pay for three years of failed attempts to control the odours emanating from the Ringsend plant.  Why could the original contractors not fix the problem?  Dublin City Council wants to increase the size of the plant while developing the Poolbeg area.  While efforts to address the odour have resulted in some improvement, the problem is not nearly solved and the issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency.I appreciate the Minister is precluded from discussing many issues affecting our constituency.  Although the odour problem in the Sandymount and Poolbeg areas may not be a burning issue, it is a serious one.  I am confident the Minister will deal with it as a matter of urgency.

I am not precluded from discussing the issue.  As the Deputy will be aware, as residents of Ringsend my family and I are personally affected by the smell emanating from the waste water treatment plant in the area.  It is completely unacceptable that residents must endure this odour nuisance.On taking office, I asked for a full report on this issue.  The odour incidences at the Ringsend plant centre around an on-site sludge treatment facility and a treatment process.  In 2005, Dublin City Council engaged independent consultants CDM of Boston, acknowledged experts in this area, to undertake an extensive technical examination of the processes at the Ringsend plant and to identify all possible sources of odours.  Following this examination, a programme of works was commenced by the contractor operating the plant on behalf of the council.  Unfortunately, the odour problem has periodically re-emerged and this has been attributed to maintenance procedures and equipment failure in the sludge process.The first phase of the work programme to deal with odours, which eliminated the potential for odour releases from the thermal hydrolysis plant, was completed in mid-2006.  The covering of the primary settlement inlet and outlet channels and the fitting of odour control units to these channels was also completed in 2006.  Further works still to be completed include the provision of new enlarged combustion chambers to the sludge dryer units, covering the remaining open primary settlement tanks and the installation of additional odour control units for these tanks.The three sludge dryers are being fitted with new combustion chambers.  It is expected work on the first unit will be completed by the end of 2007.  The second should be completed by mid-2008 and the last one by the end of 2008.  Work on the 12 primary settlement tanks will be completed, starting in February 2008 and finishing in November 2008.Some odour emissions originating from the sludge dryers have been exacerbated by the prevailing atmospheric and wind conditions.  Where such unfavourable weather conditions are predicted in the short term pending the completion of the odour action programme, the operations contractor has given the council an undertaking that the sludge production operation will be adjusted to avoid the need to use the dryers.While there has been a gradual improvement, I regret that progress has been punctuated by intermittent problems.  Complaints to the council numbered approximately 100 in June 2007.  Complaints in July, August and September were considerably reduced to 18, 7 and 26, respectively.  There have been 13 complaints to date during October.  Many people have given up calling the council.  Fed up with the situation, they feel they are not getting action on their complaints.The Deputy will accept that I am only too well aware of the annoyance and upset of people who cannot enjoy their homes or gardens because of these odours.  However, I am satisfied that the council regards the putting in place of a permanent solution as a top priority and is maintaining ongoing contact with local residents' groups.  I will tell the city manager again that the council must——

They have identified the problems, remedial measures have been devised and a programme of works to resolve the situation permanently is in progress.  It will be approximately one year before all remedial measures are completed, but both the council and the contractor on site are committed to doing everything possible to minimise any odour emissions in the meantime.  I assure the Deputy that I will be keeping a close eye on the works' progress and on the ongoing efforts to minimise nuisance to the public.  I accept that people in the area are fed up with this issue and action will be taken.

In the case of the State bus companies, the initiation or alteration of a bus service is subject to compliance with a Ministerial requirement to give advance notice to my Department and to compliance with the provisions of section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.It is an operational matter for the private bus operators themselves to apply for a licence or in the case of Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann to notify my Department of their intention to provide public bus services which utilise the Port Tunnel.  The Tunnel is currently being used by Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and a number of private operators, resulting in significant time savings for commuters. My Department is open to authorising additional services through the Tunnel, given the benefits it offers to commuters.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Under the provisions of road traffic legislation a speed limit applies to every public road and the legislative basis for the application of speed limits on public roads is set out in the Road Traffic Act 2004.  A county council or a city council can only make special speed limit bye-laws in relation to public roads that they are responsible for. A county or city manager can only make a road works speed limit order in respect of a public road.  A road authority can only provide traffic signs, including speed limit signs, on a public road and the Garda Síochána can only enforce speed limits on a public road.However, non-public roads in housing estates are classified as ‘public places' since the public have access to them with vehicles. Provisions of the road traffic legislation relating to drink driving, careless driving, driving without reasonable consideration, dangerous driving, dangerous parking, obligations to use seat belts and a range other road traffic offences can be enforced by the Garda Síochána where an offence is committed in a public place.  I have no authority to apply a default speed limit to non-public roads in private residential developments.

Current projections indicate that in the next ten years the population of Fingal in North Dublin will nearly double and employment will continue to grow significantly particularly in the city.  There is a clear transport case for a new high capacity rail link connecting Fingal with the city centre to meet both existing demand and projected future demand.  It is also a prerequisite for the construction of Metro West.The Metro North project has been through a rigorous economic and transport evaluation undertaken by the Railway Procurement Agency in accordance with Guidelines issued by the Department of Finance and which was independently assessed for the Department of Finance and the Oireachtas Transport Committee.  I am satisfied that the economic and transport evaluation of Metro North has been in accordance with best practice for such a project.In February 2006 public consultation on the preferred alignment for Metro North got underway and in October of that year my predecessor announced the preferred alignment selected by the RPA.  Since then the RPA has undertaken significant detailed design work and engaged extensively with local communities and businesses.  Arising from these consultations local alterations have been made to the preferred alignment.  These changes include the decision to go underground through Ballymun and to maximise the green space under which the Metro will run in the Drumcondra area.  Both of these changes arise from concerns from local interests raised in public consultations and the RPA has at all times sought to address these legitimate concerns whilst ensuring the overall integrity of the project.Clearly, these public consultations and consequential design changes already referred to have impacted on the timescale for the project.  However, I am satisfied that the approach taken by the RPA in seeking to address the concerns of local communities is the correct one.  The Agency hopes to be in a position to lodge an application for a railway order to An Bord Pleanála early next year.  The railway order, where granted by An Bord Pleanála, will determine the final alignment for Metro North. Subject to the grant of an enforceable railway order the RPA plans to commence construction of the project in 2009 with a target of commencing Metro operations in 2013.Throughout the planning and design process, the RPA has sought, and continues to seek, to identify measures to reduce the cost of the overall project.  The RPA is responsible for delivery of Metro North and a number of other public transport projects under Transport 21.  My Department approves the budget and business cases for these projects.  It also monitors the work of the Agency and a joint Department/RPA Monitoring Committee meets monthly to review projects and there are also regular ad hoc meetings on project-specific issues.  My Department has also retained independent advisers to review business cases and to advise on specific issues as the need arises, right across the Transport 21 investment programme.

Following a query to the Company by my Department on foot of that article, the Company, on 13th June, indicated that it was considering opening a new base at Belfast and that, if the proposal proceeded, there would be implications for Shannon. An official conveyed the concerns of the Department, from an aviation and regional development perspective, about the implications for Shannon and asked the Chief Executive to give full consideration to the ways in which a new base might be accommodated before arriving at a decision, which he agreed to do. The matter was not brought to my attention.Subsequently, an official of the Department contacted Aer Lingus on 27th July arising from a query to the Company on industrial relations matters. In the course of that conversation, it was confirmed that the Company's plans for a new base had solidified and that a formal announcement was to be made on 8th August.  It was also confirmed that opening the new Belfast base would involve the reallocation of Shannon Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008.  The official expressed concern about the impact of the loss of a Shannon — Heathrow service from an aviation and regional policy perspective, emphasised the importance of Aer Lingus commitment to Shannon and indicated that these matters would be raised with the Chief Executive of the company.In an e-mail to my private office on 27th July the official stated "The Company intends to announce the new Belfast base on 8 August. This will involve the reallocation of Shannon-Heathrow slots to Belfast from early 2008" and referred to the concerns that he had raised. A meeting with the Chairman and Chief Executive was arranged for the earliest opportunity — 3rd August — to enable me to discuss these matters with the Company.  At the meeting with the Chairman and Chief Executive of Aer Lingus on 3rd August, I was informed of the decision to open a hub in Belfast and of the re-allocation of all the Shannon-Heathrow slots to a new Belfast Heathrow service.It is very clear with the benefit of hindsight that any possibility that Aer Lingus might withdraw its Shannon Heathrow service should have been brought to my attention immediately.  I have asked my Secretary General for an urgent report setting out fully the circumstances and sequences of events which led to me not being informed or briefed on the matter before end July.  I intend to make this report public.

That effort is directed through road safety advertisement, education and enforcement measures. The Road Safety Authority has developed advertising campaigns targeted at encouraging young people to consider their attitudes, behaviour and the consequences of their actions as road users, especially as drivers.  Those campaigns are supported by high visibility enforcement by the Garda Síochána, particularly in relation to speeding, seat belt wearing and intoxicated driving.The introduction of Mandatory Alcohol Testing (MAT) and the proposed privatised operation of speed cameras, will have a significant impact on such driving behaviour.  Measures have also been introduced by the RSA to reduce driving test waiting times, a critical contribution to road safety and improved driver behaviour, with the recent announcement by the RSA that the average waiting time for a driving test is now down to 23 weeks. This represents a 30% drop in waiting times as the average waiting time stood at 33 weeks a year ago.  The RSA have also said that they will reduce the average waiting time down to 10 weeks by March next year.

The detailed planning, design and implementation of national road projects including the possible provision of service and/or rest areas on or near these routes, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Roads Act 2007, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities concerned.In recognition of the important role service area facilities can play in improving the safety of the national road network my predecessor as Minister for Transport asked the NRA in late 2005, to review their service area policy. Arising from this review the NRA announced a strategy to provide service areas at intervals (where feasible and practicable) of approximately 50-60kms along national routes.  I understand that these service areas will offer a full range of services including retail services as well as extensive car and HGV parking facilities.Late last year, the NRA identified optimum locations for up to 12 service areas on the major-inter-urban routes (M1, M4/N4, N6, M7/N7, N8, N9) as well as the N6/N18 and N11 routes.  The NRA is giving priority to the roll out of the service areas programme in view of the range of facilities they will afford to road users. The distribution envisaged, approximately at intervals of 50-60 kms, should substantially cater for road user needs. I understand that they are in dialogue with local authorities on issues relating to the provision and operation of rest areas, including operational and maintenance issues. Future strategy in this regard will be kept under review in light of these discussions and the extent to which the prioritised service areas programme addresses user needs taking account of the characteristics of the national road network, including distances between urban centres and journey times.Service area facilities will be procured through open, competitive tendering using the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism. The NRA has already begun the PPP procurement process for two service areas on the M1 and one on the M4. They are also actively pursuing site acquisition for other proposed areas on the rest of the national road network. It is anticipated that the first service area facilities will begin to come on stream on Ireland's motorway network by 2009.

Even if the Government on its own or in conjunction with other shareholders called an EGM and voted for the restoration of the Shannon Heathrow service, the directors of Aer Lingus would not be obliged to follow any direction from its shareholders.  The management of Aer Lingus has made it very clear that they are not minded to reverse their decision.

The precise arrangements for the procurement of buses from the private sector will be dealt with in this context.  The new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the recently adopted EU Regulation on Public Service Obligations in the transport sector.While it is not possible at this time to indicate a precise time as to when the legislative proposals on regulatory reform of the bus market will be published, applications and notifications from bus operators will continue to be processed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, or the notification system with reference to the Transport Act 1958, as appropriate.

The position regarding Phase 1 is that Irish Rail submitted an application for a Railway Order to An Bord Pleanala in September 2007.  The company is targeting a late 2008 start (subject to Railway Order) and a Spring 2010 completion.  The proposed line from Clonsilla to Pace includes three stations at Hansfield, Dunboyne and a major Park and Ride at Pace.In regard to the Pace/Navan phase, the position is that the feasibility work has commenced.  A scoping survey is currently underway to survey the alignment and establish what engineering and technical issues are likely to be encountered in the subsequent work to construct and open the line.  This work is expected to be completed shortly.

Updated information on all major projects is provided on my Department's Transport 21 website and on the websites of the relevant implementing agencies.Every project in Transport 21 is required to be evaluated in accordance with the Department of Finance Capital Appraisal Guidelines and Value for Money criteria. Most of the projects must also go through statutory approval processes, which usually means a public hearing before an independent inspector where the case for the project, including the overall business case, is set out. Only when statutory approval is given can the implementing agency award the relevant construction contracts.I do not consider it prudent to release commercially sensitive information on projects while these processes are continuing. However, it is my intention to provide relevant business case information and cost details once a project has successfully completed the statutory processes, all contracts have been awarded and the project is underway.

Under the Act, both the Minister for Finance and I will have to be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the three airports before any vesting of assets can take place.  The actual timing of airport restructuring will continue to depend on the creation of the appropriate conditions that will ensure the financial sustainability of each State Airport. The airports will require coordinated strategies for the achievement of operational and financial readiness and the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has a key role to play in finalizing the financial framework and coordinating business plans that would enable airport separation to take place. I will be considering the complex issues involved in the coming months.I understand that the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has been advised by consultants on an appropriate financing proposal that would facilitate the statutory objective of the separation of Cork Airport from the DAA in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of the State Airports Act 2004 and the Companies Acts.   The approach to the debt issue is crucial to the business planning process and will have to be addressed by the Cork airport board and the DAA, in the first instance, before any business plan is submitted to me and the Minister for Finance for our approval under the State Airports Act 2004.The Government's position is that the funding of the new terminal and other works at Cork Airport will have to take account, not only of what is commercially and financially feasible for Cork Airport, but also what is commercially and financially feasible for Dublin Airport.  In deciding what level of debt is to be borne by Cork, it will have to be manifest to all concerned that it is a manageable debt burden that would not put at risk the airport's commercial future.

However, I do not believe that this specific action requires that a fundamental review of our aviation policy be undertaken or that a Green Paper be published.  In line with the requirements of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, my Department is currently preparing a new Statement of Strategy for the period 2008-2010 which will, inter alia, set out our aviation strategy for the period.In general terms, our strategy to date has been to promote the development of as wide a range as possible of competitive international air services to and from Ireland to underpin our economic growth and competitiveness and this will continue to be the case.  We need to have regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country to key business and tourism markets around the world.To this end, within the European Union, Ireland has consistently supported market liberalisation measures, which have served as the platform for the rapid expansion of aviation generally.  We have also sought to influence the emerging EU and wider international framework for aviation to ensure that it continues to promote competition and innovation in the market-place.  We have promoted market liberalisation on a wider basis most recently in pressing for the conclusion of the EU-US Open Skies agreement and in concluding a more liberal agreement on a bilateral basis with Canada.I should add that our approach to the encouragement of air services is complemented by our policy on the development of airport infrastructure within the country. The main objective is to ensure that the three State Airports have sufficient capacity to respond to the growth opportunities of a competitive airline sector and to provide vital international access. In fulfilling this objective it is proposed to establish Cork and Shannon as independent airports, once financial and operational readiness has been demonstrated under the State Airports Act 2004.  In addition the six regional airports have a key role to play in promoting regional development.The further key components of our strategy are to ensure that our aviation safety and security policies comply with, or exceed, the highest international standards and that the policy framework for air navigation services ensures that the requirements of airlines for efficient routings and the avoidance of delays are met as far as possible without compromising safety.  My Department's Statement of Strategy will be published before the end of the year within the prescribed statutory timeframe.

The new Authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) subject to direction by Government in respect of significant policy issues.  Accordingly establishment of the new Authority will involve some alteration to existing institutional arrangements for the planning and delivery of surface transport in the GDA.  The details will be set out in the planned legislation.The principal functions of the proposed Authority will include:strategic transport planning.procurement of public transport infrastructure.procurement of public transport services.allocation of current and capital Exchequer funds for the provision of public transport infrastructure and services.regulation of public transport fares, routes, and service levels.delivery of integrated ticketing, integrated passenger information and integrated fares.better integration of transport and land use planning.ensuring effective traffic management.Preparation of the necessary legislation is well advanced and I will bring a Memorandum to Government in due course.  My overriding priority is to establish as quickly as possible a statutory Authority which will be effective.

However, separate penalty point systems operate in the two jurisdictions on this island, and the system that operates in Northern Ireland differs from that applying in Great Britain.For that reason, it was agreed that it would be more appropriate to pursue the question of mutual recognition of penalty points on the basis of the operation of the three systems and that it would also be more appropriate that it would be dealt with under the auspices of the British Irish Council (BIC).  As Northern Ireland has the lead role for transport matters in the BIC, the authorities in that jurisdiction are taking the lead in considering this issue.The development of any bilateral agreement on such mutual recognition will require consideration of complex legal questions, which will take time and may require the passage of primary legislation to support such an agreement.  The terms of reference for a feasibility report have been agreed at Ministerial level and a scoping report has been commissioned by the UK Department for Transport (DfT), with our agreement and that of our Northern Ireland colleagues. The DfT's In-House Policy Consultancy is carrying out the scoping exercise. This process is at an advanced stage.The focus of the roll-out of the penalty points system to date is on offences that relate primarily to the behaviour of drivers. This reflects the fact that 86% of all road deaths can be attributed to driver behaviour in its broadest sense.  The relevant support systems must be put in place to support the extension of the penalty points system, and where applicable, the fixed charge system. Discussions are held in advance with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other relevant agencies regarding the timing of each scheduled roll-out of new offences to ensure that the relevant interfaces are in place between the Garda Síochána and the Court Services IT systems, and the administration of the National Driving File.   The progressive extension of the penalty point system will continue to be pursued.

In so far as roads are concerned, the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads in its area is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Accordingly, in the case of works on non-national roads, costs associated with the proper and safe management of such works are a matter for local authorities to be funded from their own resources supplemented by State road grants provided by my Department.My Department provides grants to local authorities for works on non-national roads under a number of grant categories.  The level of grants allocated to individual authorities is determined each year having regard to a number of factors including the total funds available in a particular year, eligibility criteria for the different grant schemes, road pavement conditions, length of road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities.  In determining the annual non-national road grant allocations, the overall objective is to resource each local authority appropriately in relation to their ongoing and special needs.All non-national road grants for 2007 have now been committed and there are no additional funds at my disposal from which further grant allocations could be made at this time.  Road grants for 2008 will be determined early in the New Year.  Funding of works on national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.

Dublin Bus are currently bringing into service the 100 additional buses for which Exchequer funding of €30 million was approved in September last year.  This will bring the total Dublin Bus fleet to 1,182 buses — up from just over 900 in 1997.  A further €15.04 million was approved earlier this year towards the cost of 100 replacement buses for the Dublin Bus fleet; 50 of these replacement buses will be tri-axle buses, which offer greater passenger carrying capacity than the buses being replaced.The capacity of the Dublin Bus fleet, taking into account the 100 additional buses is now over 106,000 — an increase of more than 34% on the 2000 capacity.  This increase reflects the fact that many of the replacement buses purchased over this period were of higher capacity than the smaller, single decker buses being replaced.  Over the same period, Dublin Bus passenger numbers have grown from 134 million to 146 million passengers per annum, an increase of 9%.  The provision of additional buses, over and above the 100 currently being brought into service, is currently being considered in the context of the Programme for Government.As regards accessibility, all buses purchased by Dublin Bus since 2000 are low-floor wheelchair accessible.  I understand from Dublin Bus that currently over 60% of the fleet is accessible and that the company plans to have all of the fleet accessible by 2012.  The policy of purchasing accessible buses will continue as the bus fleet is replaced and expanded over time.

The report also shows that road deaths in Ireland have dropped by 11% since 200.  While the report has tracked Ireland's progress up to the 31st December 2006, the downward trend in road deaths and collisions, which commenced in August 2006 with the introduction of roadside Mandatory Alcohol Testing, is clearly evident in 2007.Since the introduction of key changes in the road safety area including Mandatory Alcohol Testing, the increase in penalties for drink driving offences, the extension of the penalty points system, greater Garda visibility and enforcement and, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority, there has been a marked reduction in the number of road deaths, despite ever increasing numbers of vehicles on our roads.  The number of road deaths in 2006 at 368 was the second lowest rate recorded in 40 years and the downward trend continues.

The consultation paper incorporated a number of proposed changes in vehicle specifications and standards, including in the area of accessibility.  It is understood that the Commission has commenced a regulatory impact assessment on these proposals and continues to liaise with key stakeholders, and will publish revised vehicle specifications for small public service vehicles before the end of 2007.While this process of public consultation is underway, my Department is in discussion with the Commission about an outline proposal for a draft subsidy scheme or some other mechanism to assist with the purchase of wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible hackneys.  The subsidy proposal and associated vehicle specification are still being researched and developed by the Commission.  The proposal is to provide assistance with the purchase of a fully accessible small public service vehicle, the specification for which is being developed by the Commission.Upon completion of the consultation process and the preparation and introduction of new and fully accessible vehicle standards by the Commission, with definitive associated costs, a final decision will be made on the subsidy scheme proposal.

The campaign targets car drivers specifically.  The campaign promotes cycling as one of the best ways of getting fresh air, regular exercise, saving money, saving journey time and benefiting the local and general environment.It also emphasises safety and points to improved conditions for cyclists in Dublin City Centre since the Port Tunnel opened.  There are now far fewer heavy vehicles in the city centre and extra sections of cycle lane and bus lane (which cyclists can use) on the north quays and, in general, an improved traffic environment in the city centre.My Department has also provided funding to the Dublin Transportation Office who initiated the Safer Routes to School project in 2000, with 6 pilot schemes being implemented.  The objectives of the Green Schools Initiative are to raise awareness of sustainable travel and transport, increase the number of children who walk and cycle, increase the number of families who ‘park and stride' or ‘carpool', improve safety on the school run by promoting safe practices and awareness of hazards, reduce school-related congestion, and improve physical health and fitness.The programme was extended and currently has 29 schools with a combined student population of approximately 10,400 with 545 teachers.  Results from the initiative show that, of journeys to school, between March and June 2006, walking increased by 7% to 40%, and car use decreased by 8% to 46%, while, on the journey from school, walking increased by 4% from 37% to 41% and car use fell by 9%.  A further roll-out of the programme is being considered at present.My Department is currently in the process of commissioning research in relation to best practice which will assist in the development of a National Cycling Policy.  This will, in turn, feed into the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which the Government is committed to publishing in the Spring of 2008.  That Plan will specifically address the issues relating to children travelling to and from school.

Carried out in 2005/2006, the study concluded, inter alia, that: There is currently significant available capacity for further growth in LoLo traffic at Irish ports; Current available capacity for RoRo traffic also exists, although less so than in the case of LoLo.  The study demonstrated that the projects being progressed by the ports sector have the potential to deliver adequate capacity going forward, in line with the established policy.I believe that our key commercial ports are well positioned to continue to function efficiently as vital economic gateways to the rest of the world.  My Department is continuing to actively monitor the capacity situation and has recently received update reports from the seven ports that made submissions as part of the study.  I am encouraged by the fact that the ports continue to make significant progress with their proposals.With regard to capacity at international ports, it is true to say that Ireland relies heavily on the European hub ports such as Antwerp and Rotterdam. Capacity is being increased at these and other trans-shipment ports. The healthy competition that exists for port services in the EU should deliver adequate capacity to serve our needs.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, which advises my Department on these matters, keeps in close contact with relevant international developments.

It is a matter for each road authority to identify locations where they wish to apply the prohibition on the parking of large vehicles and to identify the weight threshold that would apply an appropriate measure at each location.  No road authority has sought any updating or amendment to the 1997 provisions in relation to the parking of large vehicles.The application and enforcement of parking controls under the road traffic law only applies to public roads which are roads that have been taken in charge by a road authority. The imposition of parking controls in private residential developments is a matter for the management company of that estate to pursue under contract and civil law remedies as applicable.A road authority has no remit to provide traffic signs and apply parking controls on private property.  The Garda Síochána, local authority traffic wardens or clamping immobilisation operators engaged by the local authority have no power to enforce parking on private property.  I do not propose to seek to extend the application of the road traffic statutes to private roads i.e. non-public roads.

An Bord Pleanála's recent decision with regard to the granting of permission for the development of phase one of Terminal 2 now provides the basis for moving ahead with that much needed additional capacity.As to a third terminal, based on current passenger growth rates, I understand that there will be a need for such a terminal in the medium to long term when terminals one and two are at full capacity. My  Department is in discussion with the DAA on the future infrastructure needs of the airport. This includes the timescale for planning for the delivery of a third terminal, in line with the Government decision of May 2005.

Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for ensuring that penalty points are endorsed on a licence record. Data in relation to penalty points is held on the National Driver File.  As foreign licence holders do not have an Irish driving licence record, penalty points incurred in this State are recorded against that person on a separate record in the National Driver File. The realisation of fines and penalties imposed by the Courts is a matter for the Courts Service.I am conscious that enforcing penalties for road traffic offences on foreign registered drivers raises many legal, organisational and procedural issues, which make it very difficult for any one State to enforce such penalties.  For that reason, my Department is pursuing this question at the European, British/Irish and North/South levels where mutual recognition and cross border enforcement possibilities are under consideration.

In view of the scarcity and value of slot allocations at Heathrow, it was considered appropriate to put in place measures to prevent the sale of Aer Lingus's slot allocation to other airlines.  Arrangements to safeguard the Heathrow slots are built into the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association.  The effect of these arrangements is that any sale or long-term lease of Heathrow slots to other airlines can be prevented by 30.4% of the votes cast at an Extraordinary General Meeting.The re-deployment of slots and other resources in this particular case was a commercial decision made by the executive management team in the Company.  The decision was taken by management of Aer Lingus on foot of a mandate from the Board to examine and develop commercial opportunities, in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company.  There is clear legal advice to the effect that, having regard to the duties of the Board of Directors pursuant to the Companies Acts and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Aer Lingus, shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.In law, the Directors are responsible for managing the company's business and all Directors, including the State appointees, are bound by their fiduciary responsibilities under the Companies Acts.  I have decided to appoint two further directors to the board of Aer Lingus. I will ask the State appointees to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company, that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies, are considered at board level.  That will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of each decision and to ensure that the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.  The State appointees to the board do not, nor will they, have a veto on board decisions.At the time of the IPO it was recognised that there was a need to balance the State's strategic interests in relation to Heathrow slots with a need to allow the company to have reasonable commercial flexibility in its operations while respecting the EU Treaty requirements relating to ‘golden shares'.  The safeguards put in place at the time of the IPO against disposal of slots were devised on the basis of legal advice.  It was clear from contacts with the European Commission that any measure for the protection of Heathrow slots that could be solely exercised by the Government would be regarded by the Commission as a special right, which would be challenged before the European Court of Justice.

Ireland remains on course to meet its revised interim target of 2% for 2008, which was agreed by the EU, through the Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Scheme II, announced in November 2006.  This Scheme will place 163 million litres of biofuels on the market at a cost to the Exchequer of €200 million over the period 2006-2010.  It is expected that, at full capacity in 2008, the Biofuels MOTR Scheme II will result in 2.2% of transport fuels being met by biofuels resulting in savings of over 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the five-year period.As part of my overall objective for sustainable urban transportation I have requested CIE to move to a 30% bio-diesel blend in all new buses as part of their fleet replacement policy.

At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for development in the ten-year period and estimated the cost of implementing these projects at €34 billion, in current cost terms. An indicative timetable for completion of the major projects was also provided at that time.The original timetable was designed to set challenging targets for the agencies and was drawn-up at a time when many of the projects mentioned were only at design/planning stage.  Inevitably, within a programme of this scale, it will be necessary to amend estimated completion dates as projects develop.  Final completion dates for projects will only be determined when the planning process and contract negotiations have been concluded.  So far, it has been necessary to revise the indicative completion dates for some projects because of circumstances arising before construction, while other projects have been delivered ahead of schedule.My Department is closely monitoring and very actively managing the Transport 21 programme to ensure that projects are delivered in the shortest possible timescale, consistent with the annual funding available.  In overall terms, there is no evidence to suggest that all of the projects identified in Transport 21 will not be completed by 2015, within the overall budget of €34 billion.

These include technology improvements, rebalancing of motor taxes and fuel economy labelling, Dublin Traffic measures, Mineral Oil Tax Relief for biofuels, modal shift through Transport 21, alignment of transport investment with spatial planning, and the achievement of a 5.75% biofuels blend in fuels by 2010.  In all the transport sector will provide up to 13% in total national emission savings under that Strategy.I have also announced the preparation of a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which will set out a broad suite of policies and measures to help the transport sector progress along a more sustainable trajectory and make a further contribution to reducing emissions to 2020.  The Action Plan will consider the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions along with other elements of sustainability relating to economic competitiveness and quality of life and the aim is to publish the Plan in the Spring of 2008.

The consolidation phase of this project is to provide a consolidated working text of all the extant Acts, on which the review can then be based.  It is not my intention to prepare a Consolidation Act per se, but rather to introduce in due course a modern, updated and single replacement Merchant Shipping Act.The informal consolidation phase of the project should be completed by the end of the year.  The review will take place in 2008, to be followed by the preparation of a new Merchant Shipping Bill.  Merchant shipping is a complex and rapidly evolving sector, given its globalised nature, the increasing focus on the safety agenda, the pace of change driven by international maritime conventions and the European Union, and the rise in marine leisure activities.  It is important that the framework for Ireland's merchant shipping legislation is both up to date and flexible, and that is my objective in pursuing this project.

I intend to launch this new strategy, in conjunction with the RSA in the coming weeks.  The issue of the type of barrier to be used on national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act 1993.  The NRA is a member of the European Committee for Standardisation of Safety Barriers.The NRA, as a matter of practice, keep road design standards, including safety aspects, under regular review and I understand that they are currently carrying out research on the use of wire barriers across Europe.  In accordance with EU Directive 2003/97 new HGVs entering into service from 26 January 2007 must be equipped with enhanced mirrors including cyclops mirrors to improve the fields of indirect vision of drivers of these vehicles.In the case of HGVs which entered into service between I January 2000 and 25 January 2007 the European Union has recently adopted a directive (EU Directive 2007/38) which provides for the retrofitting of enhanced mirrors on the passenger side of these vehicles to be undertaken by 31 March 2009.  During consideration of this directive as a proposal, Ireland together with a number of Member States, sought unsuccessfully to have it expanded to include the retrofitting of cyclops mirrors.  However, the European Commission undertook to consider further the question of accidents associated with blind spots on HGVs.Finally, under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the issue of wearing high visibility clothing and the mandatory usage of safety helmets by cyclists is now a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

The effect of these arrangements, at present, is that any disposal of Heathrow slots can be prevented by 30.4% of the votes cast at an Extraordinary General Meeting.  25.4% of the shares in the Company are held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State.Also, under the memorandum and articles of association, the State is entitled to appoint three directors to the board of Aer Lingus. Currently, there is one State appointed director serving on the board and it is now proposed that two further appointments be made. I envisage that the State appointees, will be mandated to seek to ensure that future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level. This will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of decisions and to ensure that the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.  All directors, including the State appointees, will of course be bound by their fiduciary responsibilities under the Companies Acts.

The company has statutory responsibility for all day-to-day matters at these airports, including their marketing for new routes and new airlines.Under its commercial mandate DAA has the key role in developing the airports and thereby promoting the provision of as wide a range as possible of air services into and out of Ireland. Recent traffic growth at the airports confirms the success of the DAA in attracting airline interest and developing new air routes. I envisage that this commercial approach to air services development will be central to the operation of the airports concerned in the future.With specific reference to Shannon Airport I know that an incentive scheme for new services to European hubs was recently launched there. More generally, the Deputy will be aware that in the light of the recent report of the Senior Officials Group on Aviation the Government has asked relevant Ministers to consult further with the local and regional authorities and report back with proposals for unlocking the further development potential of the Limerick-Shannon Gateway and its wider region.

These regulations restrict the use of bus lanes to buses or minibuses operating under a public service licence, as well as allowing taxis and pedal cycles to use bus lanes which are with-flow (as opposed to contra-flow).I have now received a request from the Commission for Taxi Regulation to amend regulations so as to permit the use of bus lanes by hackneys and limousines.  In considering this request, I have received the views of several interested bodies.

When the scheme is fully operational, it is expected that it will contribute 2.2% of total transport fuel consumption.  In addition, obligatory fuel blending of 5% will be introduced by 2009 which will help to achieve the indicative target of 5.75% set out in the Biofuels Directive 2003/30/EC. The remainder will be achieved through higher biofuel blends and use of pure plant oil (PPO) in captive fleets maintained by private and public transport operators.  My Department has also provided support for transport operators to convert their vehicles to run on 100% PPO as part of a scheme operated by the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce in 2007.Despite the success of this pilot scheme and the interest expressed in it by operators, I have no immediate intention to extend it or provide any other additional grants for vehicle modification, until the proposed Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan emerges in 2008.  Notwithstanding this, there is currently a provision for a 50% VRT relief on flexi-fuelled vehicles (FFV), which are capable of operating on 85% blend, for 2006 and 2007. Furthermore, it is expected that changes to the current VRT and motor tax system will reward purchasers and owners of low-carbon vehicles.

Iarnród Éireann is currently undertaking a nationwide programme of expanding and upgrading station car parks and 17 of these are in the GDA. New facilities at Leixlip Louisa Bridge and Adamstown were opened already this year and plans are well advanced at Donabate, Rush, Lusk and Sallins. Upgraded facilities at Gormanston for 250 cars have also recently been provided.To date, 800 extra spaces have been provided in the GDA, along with the 200 extra spaces at Sallins which will be opened shortly.  I have approved funding for Iarnród  Éireann for a further 600 spaces at 3 other sites and proposals for a further 500 spaces are being considered by my Department.  The park and ride sites on the proposed Luas and Metro lines will open simultaneously with the start-up of services. The extension of the Luas line to Cherrywood will include a park and ride sites with 350 spaces at Carrickmines which will open in late-2010.  Proposals from local authorities for rail-based park and ride facilities will also be considered for Transport 21 funding.A DTO report has concluded that bus-based park and ride has a limited role in Dublin because of the city's size and consequent distances. Nonetheless, where there is a sound business case, my Department will give favourable consideration to funding. I understand that Dublin South County Council is awaiting the outcome of its application to An Bord Pleanála for permission for a bus-based park and ride facility close to Leixlip.

Each Priority contains a number of programmes which are further divided into sub-programmes.  In relation to funding total investment under the Plan in the period 2007-2013 will amount to approximately €184 billion which is broken down as follows:Priority2007-2013Total  €mEconomic Infrastructure54,660Enterprise, Science and Innovation20,006Human Capital25,796Social Infrastructure33,612Social Inclusion49,636Total183,709The €184 billion total investment under the NDP over the period 2007-2013 is comprised of approximately €100 billion of capital and €84 billion of current investment. Some €143 billion of investment over the period will be funded by the Exchequer.  It is expected that PPPs will contribute some €13 billion and investment by Commercial State Bodies will total some €16 billion over the lifetime of the Plan.  The remainder of the investment will be made up of Local Authority own resources and other sources (including the Local Government Fund, the Environment Fund and the National Training Fund).Monitoring of progress under the Plan at Priority, Programme and Sub-Programme level will be undertaken by the Central Monitoring Committee (CMC) for the Plan which is chaired by my Department.  The CMC is comprised of representatives from all relevant Government Departments, the Social Partners, Regional Assemblies and Authorities and Environmental Interests.  The first meeting of the CMC is scheduled for later this year.  As stated in the NDP, the CMC will assess progress under the NDP by reference to a Report which will be prepared by my Department based on material received from Departments and Implementing Agencies.  My Department will also coordinate the drafting of an Annual Report on NDP implementation which will be submitted to the Government and subsequently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas where it shall be subject to debate.Details of the first year of implementation figures in relation to spend in 2007, including PPP investment, will be set out in the 2007 NDP Annual Report which will be produced and submitted to the Oireachtas in 2008.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that Exchequer capital issues were above profile for the period to end September and this indicates that NDP spending from that source is going well.

The benefits of projects and programmes in areas including childcare, housing, rural development, training and business innovation have been experienced nationwide and the completion of many of these programmes has both improved our social infrastructure and encouraged regional development.The ESRI (Oct 2006) in its ex-ante assessment of investment priorities for the NDP 2007-2013 concluded that "The NDP/CSF 2000-2006 has greatly enhanced the economic and social infrastructure of the State with major benefits to economic development throughout all regions".The NDP/CSF 2000-2006 is implemented through seven Operational Programmes, two of these are the Border, Midlands and Western (BMW) Programme and the Southern and Eastern (S&E) Programme which are managed by the two Regional Assemblies.  Both of these Regional Programmes complement the National Programmes and make a significant contribution to the socioeconomic development of the two regions.The most recent information available to my Department, following the June NDP/CSF Monitoring Committee meeting, regarding expenditure under NDP/CSF 2000-2006 to the end of December 2006 indicates that some €2.8 billion and €4.1 billion has been invested under the BMW and S&E Programmes respectively.The four priorities set out in the Regional Programmes are local infrastructure; local enterprise; local agriculture/rural development; and social inclusion and childcare.  Highlights of the BMW programme include the improvement, restoration and maintenance of more than 26,000 kilometres of non-national roads; the creation of more than 18,500 jobs by County Enterprise Boards in supported enterprises; and the provision of over 12,000 additional childcare places.  Highlights of the S&E Programme include the improvement, restoration and maintenance of more than 28,000 kilometres of non-national roads; the creation of more than 14,000 jobs by County Enterprise Boards in supported enterprises; and the provision of over 22,000 additional childcare places.In terms of forecasting expenditure until the end of the NDP/CSF 2000-2006, it is important to point out that spending on EU co-financed measures can continue until 2008 as set out in the EU regulations.  At this stage, based on the information available, it is estimated that some €3 billion and €4.3 billion will have been invested under the BMW and S&E Programmes, respectively, when the programme is completed.

Individuals claiming tax relief on contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) or Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) make that claim by way of a tax return to the Revenue Commissioners.Figures illustrating the highest value of tax relief achievable (and how this is arrived at) for pension contributions by individuals in the years 2004 to 2007 are set out in the table.YearContribution earnings capHighest proportion of contribution earnings cap allowableAmount of highest contribution allowableTop rate of income taxValue of highest amount of contribution allowable in terms of tax saving€%€%€2004254,0003076,2004232,0042005254,0003076,2004232,0042006254,00040101,6004242,6722007262,38240104,9534143,031The relief can be doubled in the case of a married couple where each spouse qualifies for the maximum individual relief.On the basis of the information available from tax records, the highest values of tax relief allowed in 2004 (the most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available) were €64,008 for RACs and €42,000 for PRSAs.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was conditional on a strong focus on disadvantage and that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question which ensured that childcare places subsidised were targeted towards those most inneed.As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.I cannot comment on the figure of 10% the Deputy has quoted for the number of children in participating facilities who will benefit from subvention, as until the childcare groups make their returns next month, it will not be possible to establish the relevant figure.  I am however informed that such a percentage would be inconsistent with the data provided by groups when they applied for EOCP staffing funding.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.

These have taken place and have provided very useful feedback.  The details of the new scheme, the rates of subvention which will be available to community childcare services in respect of disadvantaged parents, and the timeframe within which the new arrangements are being implemented, were also outlined.  The information seminars have been followed up by updated information packs, which take account of some of the issues raised and responded to at the seminars.  These have issued this week along with the forms which the services will need to complete and return by 2 November 2007 as part of the application process.As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.

However under the transitional arrangements which accompany the introduction of the new scheme, existing grant recipients entering the new scheme can continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.

This amount incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy. This Strategy is committed to enhancing, the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism, including therapy services.The Disability Act, 2005 is a central element of the National Disability Strategy. The Act is a positive measure designed to advance and underpin participation by people with disabilities in everyday life.  Under Part 2 of the Act a person with a disability (or their parent, spouse relative, guardian or personal representative) is entitled to apply for an independent assessment of need. An Assessment Officer will coordinate this Assessment and shall commence the assessment process as soon as possible after the completed application form has been received but not later than three months after that date. At the end of this process the person will receive an Assessment report.This report will state if the person has a disability (as defined in the Act) and where it is determined that the person does, the report will contain a statement of the nature and extent of the disability, a statement of the health and education needs (if any) occasioned to the person by the disability and a statement of the services considered appropriate by the Assessment Officer. The Executive shall complete the assessment, the assessment report and forward the assessment report to the Liaison Officer within a further three months from the date on which the assessment commenced, save for in exceptional circumstances, when the assessment will be completed without undue delay. This report must be written without regard to the cost or capacity to provide any of the services they need.Part 2 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007.  This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act. The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	503	The development of Services for Older People, including the development of services for people living with dementia, is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to Services for Older People in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in Services for Older People with a full year cost of €150m.  This year a full year package of €255m has been allocated for Services for Older People.  This gives a total of over €400m added to services for older people over two years.Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers. The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with dementia. This commitment is reflected in the additional funding of approximately €109 million in Budget 2006 and  €82 million in Budget 2007 which was allocated to community supports for older people, including those with dementia. These supports include Home Care Packages, the Home Help Scheme and Respite Care.The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home. In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55 million (prior to this date only 1,100 Packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A similar increase in the number of Packages will be provided in 2007, benefiting some 4,000 people. An additional €21 million has been provided in 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional Home Help hours in 2007.  This brings the total funding allocated to Home Helps to approximately €171 million per annum.Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia. The provision of an additional €9 million in 2006 funded a further 1,325 additional places per week in these centres, together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open. Additional funding of €3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development of services for people suffering from Dementia. The HSE's Capital Plan for 2007 includes significant investment provision to progress projects in the older people sector.The Deputy may be aware that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement  "Towards 2016" is the development of a national carer's strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While financial support for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.The Department of Social & Family Affairs has lead responsibility for the development of the Carer's Strategy and is currently considering how best to ensure all relevant Departments and agencies can be involved in the strategy.  My officials in the Department of Health & Children will continue to work with their counterparts in the Department of Social & Family Affairs to progress matters.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.

LLSR recently applied to my Department to amend their licences and authorisations to reflect their proposed winter schedule which the company wanted to introduce from 03 September 2007. This included the withdrawal of services from the Malin Head area and Manorcunningham village.While the withdrawal of any service is regretted, the provision of bus services on specific routes is a commercial and operational matter for bus operators provided they comply with the relevant legislation. It is open to any operator to apply to my Department for a licence or International Authorisation to provide bus services in the area.  There is currently no legal framework enabling my Department to pay subvention to private operators.

There are no legislative proposals under consideration to make it mandatory for all cyclists to wear helmets and to thereby bring the matter into the remit of the criminal law code.Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has now responsibility for the promotion and awareness of road safety including the promotion of safety for cyclists.  The new Rules of the Road book that was published last March and a copy distributed to each household countrywide contains expanded advice and recommendations to cyclists in relation to the use of protective equipment and recommends that a helmet be worn at all times.

The Programme provided for a total infrastructural investment of €26.019 billion, of which €6.999 billion was earmarked for the BMW Region and €19.020 billion for the South and East Region.Total cumulative expenditure from the start of the Programme in 2000 up to the end of 2006 was €28.539 billion.  Of this sum, €6.828 billion was spent in the BMW Region and €21.711 billion was spent in the South and East Region.  The NDP 2000-2006, of which the ESIOP is a major component, came to a formal end on 31st December, 2006 and has been succeeded by the NDP 2007-2013.  However, projects in four areas (National Roads, Public Transport, Waste Water and Sustainable Energy) continue to benefit from EU financial assistance provided from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) towards the ESIOP.  Expenditure on these EU co-funded projects continues to be eligible for EU aid up to the end of December, 2008.  The Department of Transport, as the managing authority for the ESIOP under EU Regulations, is currently collating expenditure data on the EU co-funded areas for the first 6 months of 2007, together with forecasts, for presentation to a meeting of the Monitoring Committee which oversees the implementation of the ESIOP.  This information will be provided to the Deputy following review and approval by the Monitoring Committee at its next meeting on 14th November, 2007.

The position in regard to the improvement of railway services on the Maynooth line is that capacity has been trebled in the last five years. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that it is currently reviewing its plans for resignalling in the city centre area as part of its broader plans for the upgrade of railway infrastructure in the Dublin area and that in this context it is considering the removal of level crossings and resignalling of the Maynooth line as a means of substantially further increasing capacity on the line.With regard to the Kildare line, capacity has increased by 160% on this line in recent years, along with platform extensions allowing for longer trains, introduction of Sunday services and the turnback facility at Newbridge that provides for Newbridge specific trains to operate. Furthermore, the Kildare Route project will see four-tracking between Cherry Orchard and Hazelhatch that will allow intercity trains to bypass the commuter services serving the outer Dublin area leading to more efficient use of the rail network. In the medium term the Interconnector and the associated electrification will also provide a significant increase in capacity and service on the Kildare Line.  The provision of feeder and linking bus services to railway stations is a matter for the bus operators in conjunction with Iarnród Éireann.

These buses, together with the new buses to be purchased by Bus Éireann, and the provision of services by private operators, will facilitate the expansion and extension of services to serve new developments.  Detailed deployment of additional buses by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, including the areas and routes to be served and the frequency of service is a matter for the companies having regard to the level of demand and resources available to them. In addition, private bus operators may be licensed on new routes in accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932.

The REA does not specify the particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general parameters within which any such scheme should operate.The Construction Workers Pension Scheme has been established on foot of the Registered Employment Agreement.  While it is not a legal requirement for employers and employees in the construction industry to pay into this pension scheme, it is a legal requirement that employers provide for pension, mortality and sick benefits for those workers to whom the REA applies. The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA. The Scheme is administered and monitored on behalf of employers and employees by the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency (CIMA).Enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement the Court may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.  In exercising its powers in this regard, the Court can request the assistance of the National Employment Rights Authority in inspecting employer records to assess compliance.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 166 together.From 1 November 2007, new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 299 of 2007), made under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, relating to First-Aid at places of work, generally replace and revoke similar provisions in the 1993 Regulations of the same name (S.I. No. 44 of 1993).The 2005 Act and the 2007 General Application Regulations, as they apply to public and private gyms and fitness clubs as places of work, relate to the safety, health and welfare of the employees there rather than that of patrons per se. While the legislation does not explicitly require the provision of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in all places of work, I understand that draft Guidance on the General Application Regulations, which the Health and Safety Authority is about to publish, advises that:The provision of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in workplaces to prevent sudden cardiac death should be considered, and that early defibrillation using an AED is one of the vital links in the chain of survival.  Ideally, wherever there is an occupational first aider(s) in a workplace, provision of an AED should be considered.  The training of other employees who are not occupational first-aider(s) in the use of AEDs is also encouraged.Whereas it may be practicable and desirable to have an AED in every workplace, due to cost considerations it would be unreasonable to expect all employers (especially small and medium size enterprises (SMEs)) to have one on their premises, even if there is an occupational first-aider present. These costs not only include the purchase price but also the cost of maintenance of the equipment and refresher training for those trained in how to use AEDs.However, different employers at the same location, such as in shopping centres, small business enterprise centres etc., where relatively large numbers of employees or other persons are likely to be habitually present, might find it feasible to co-operate in the provision of shared AED equipment, training and assistance.Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places of work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazards (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aider(s) must also be provided.  I have no plans to amend the legislation referred to as it deals with first aid at places of work.

Nationally overall expenditure under the Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme 2000-2006, to the end of 2006, was over €14.9 billion or 105% of forecast, with the ESF element presently standing at almost €907 million or 102% of forecast.  Whilst expenditure on the NDP part of the Operational Programme ceased at the end of 2006, some ESF funding remains to be spent during 2007 (under the EU N+2 rule).  The ESF element of the EHRD OP has satisfied the requirements of the N+2 rule for each year of the programme and full utilisation of allocated ESF funding is expected for the overall programming period.Under the South and East Region, at the end of 2006, total expenditure reached €10.6 billion or 102.6% of the forecast.  Expenditure on the ESF for the same period reached €549.5 million or 104.3% of forecast.  Under the BMW Region, at the end of 2006, total expenditure reached €4.3 billion or 97.4% of forecast.  The ESF expenditure for the same period reached €357.7 million or 97.9% of forecast.

Claims are processed automatically if child benefit is already in payment for other children in the family once the birth details are registered with the General Registrar's Office.  Parents are contacted in most cases by the Child Benefit office within two days of the registration of their child's birth. If there is no Child Benefit claim already in payment, then a pre-prepared application form is issued as soon as the birth details are registered. On return of the completed form the claim is awarded and payment issues normally within 7-10 days.With regard to claims for children born outside Ireland, these fall into two categories — those born outside Ireland and now living here; and those born, and remaining resident, outside Ireland.There is a total of some 6,000 claims for non-Irish national children born outside Ireland and now resident in Ireland at various stages of processing.  These cases can be slow to process as the customer must first satisfy the Habitual Residence condition. This may entail contacting employers, the Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the State.  In addition, checks are made with schools to confirm the permanent residency of the children in Ireland.  The average processing time for these claims is 6 months.There is a further 19,000 claims from EU nationals for non-resident children in the course of being processed at present.  EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits (of which Child Benefit is one) in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made in respect of non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the children's country of residence to confirm their details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable there.  This process can take a number of months to complete.  The average time at present for this category of claim is some 12 months.Child Benefit is currently in payment under EU Regulations to some 1,300 families, in respect of almost 3,000 children resident outside the Republic of Ireland.  The estimated cost of such claims in 2007 is €25 million.  Efforts are ongoing to process Child Benefit claims in respect of non-Irish national children as efficiently as possible.  Measures being taken include examination of the processes involved to ensure they are as streamlined as possible; the judicious use of overtime working; and the addition of extra staff on a temporary basis to process these claims.

This is based on a family rate of payment which is made up of a personal rate, a full qualified adult rate and full child dependant allowance rate less means applicable.  Under the new assessment insurable earnings of the spouse/partner are calculated as the gross earnings less PRSI, Superannuation and Trade Union Subscriptions.  There is no disregard for deductions in respect of income tax and Health Insurance premiums e.g. VHI etc. or travel expenses.  A disregard of €20.00 a day also applies for each day worked by the spouse/partner up to a maximum of €60 a week inclusive of Sunday and the balance of income is assessed at 60%.By way of example, if the spouse of a customer were to work on Sunday only and earned €60 (having made appropriate allowances for PRSI, Superannuation and Health Insurance) a disregard of €20 would be allowed in respect of 1 day's work and the balance of €40 would be assessed at 60% i.e. €24 means would be deducted from the family rate for that customer.  The family rate for Jobseeker's Allowance is currently, €185.80 personal rate, €123.30 qualified adult rate and €22.00 for each qualified child.Jobseekers BenefitThe payment of a qualified adult allowance on jobseeker's benefit is based on the income of the spouse/partner.   A full qualified adult allowance is payable if the spouse's/partner has weekly income up to or including €100.00 gross.  A reduced rate is payable if the weekly income is between €100.01 and €280.00 (gross). No allowance is payable if the income is more than €280.00 (gross).

This figure includes expenditure on projects which were mainstreamed to the Department of Education & Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as well as the Springboard Initiative under the aegis of the Department of Health & Children.  It is envisaged that total YPFSF expenditure under the NDP 2000-2006 will amount to approximately €137m, taking account of expenditure which continued beyond the end of 2006.Under the new National Development Plan 2007-2013, a total of €319m has been allocated under the National Drugs Strategy Sub Programme.

This outlines how the Plan, within the framework of national policies and programmes, will assist the social and economic development of rural areas in the coming years.  In this context, it sets out a range of interventions — in areas such as broadband, non-national roads, rural transport initiatives, rural water services, CLÁR, the Rural Social Scheme and LEADER/Rural Economy programmes.I might briefly set out the position in relation to schemes which come directly within the remit of my Department:CLÁRUnder the NDP, the CLÁR sub-programme is being allocated €141m over the period of the plan for the on-going regeneration of rural areas suffering from population decline.  To date €8m has been spent in 2007.Rural Social SchemeFunding of €214m for the RSS for the period 2007-2013 is included in the NDP for the RSS.  This clearly confirms the Government's continued and on-going commitment to the Scheme in the coming years.  At present, there is provision for 2,600 participants and 130 supervisors on the Scheme and all available places have been allocated.  To date, a total of €38,160,306 has been spent in 2007.Farm Relief ServicesUnder the NDP Farm Relief Services is being allocated in the region of €4 million for the expansion of existing farm relief services. €593,000 has been spent to-date.EU Rural Development programmeIn tandem with the NDP, the new EU Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 will be rolled out over the coming months.  Under the Programme, over €425m will be allocated to support LEADER-type activities.  Priorities under the new Programme will include the continued development of the rural/agri-tourism, craft and small food sectors and the delivery of the Countryside Recreation Strategy. Supports for the development of rural enterprise will also be a significant feature under the new Programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	Standards for organic production are laid down in the Council Regulation on organic production (EEC) No. 2092/91 as amended.  The Council Regulation is given full effect in Ireland by the European Communities (Organic Farming) Regulations 2004 (S.I. No. 112 of 2004).  These national Regulations also specify certain additional standards for the production of livestock and livestock products in Ireland.  The Regulations are implemented both directly by my Department and, on the basis of a service agreement, by three private organic certification bodies — Demeter Standards Ltd, Organic Trust and the Irish Organic Farmers' and Growers' Association.In relation to the 5% land area target, there are significant financial supports in place to encourage producers to convert to and remain in organic production. The new Organic Farming Scheme was launched in August 2007 as part of the new Rural Development Programme, which will run from 2007 to 2013.  The objective of this Scheme is to deliver enhanced environmental and animal welfare benefits and to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food. Payment rates have increased by approximately 17% compared to comparative rates under the Supplementary Measure in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  Under the new Organic Farming Scheme, it is now possible for organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be in the REPS Scheme as was previously the case.  This is designed to encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production, and conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings.  Both of these areas are very much in deficit production-wise and there is a ready-made market for the organic product. Organic producers will still, of course, be able to join REPS as well, and I would encourage them to do so.As a further incentive to encourage non-REPS farmers solely involved in tillage production to convert to organic farming, there is an additional payment of €240 per hectare available in the in-conversion period, up to a maximum of 40 hectares, provided they grow green cover crops during that period.My Department also offers significant development grants both to farmers and to processors under the Schemes of Grant Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector. Grant aid is available for investments by farmers and processors in equipment and facilities.  The Schemes provide grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of €60,000 in the case of on-farm investments and €500,000 for investments off-farm. I am pleased to note that applicants are showing significant interest in these Schemes.  Other initiatives include the recent appointment by Teagasc of three additional specialist organic advisor posts, an enhanced demonstration programme and the extension of agronomist expertise to include the pig and poultry sectors this year.  We will continue to raise awareness among consumers about the benefits of organic food and the third National Organic Week takes place next week with that specific purpose in mind.It is clear that all stakeholders will have to play a proactive role to enable this challenging target to be realised. To this end I have asked for and received submissions from the organic farming bodies with their proposals for the development of the sector.  I have also asked the National Steering Group for the Organic Sector and its two sub-groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Marketing and Development Group, to give me their considered views on the best ways to move towards the Programme for Government target.

I have consistently outlined my position on non-trade concerns in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, most recently on 26 September, by emphasising that the Commission must pursue recognition of these issues in the ongoing negotiations.If the Doha mandate is to be fulfilled, non-trade concerns must be dealt in the final WTO agreement, and I will continue to insist that these matters are addressed as part of a successful conclusion of the round.

In this context the EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) is to carry out a further mission to Brazil in November to assess progress in the implementation and operation of controls by the competent authorities in that country.Consumers are entitled to information on the country of origin of beef. For this reason I collaborated with the Minister for Health & Children to ensure the introduction of legislation providing that beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector must carry an indication of the country of origin. Responsibility for enforcement of this legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).

This can be further broken down in terms of land use as follows:  grassland 37,048 hectares, cereals 830 hectares and horticulture 338 hectares.  This category of land use is determined in accordance with the definitions laid down in EU Regulations, and specifically in the Council Regulation on organic production (EEC) No. 2092/91 as amended.

The report contained a total of 37 recommendations as to how the future of the sheep sector could be secured going forward. I established an Implementation Group, also under the chairmanship of Mr. Malone, in July 2006, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.The Implementation Group reported in April. Most of the recommendations in the report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact. The recommendations do not set out specific payments for sheep farmers but are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading, quality assurance and health and welfare.In addition and in line with the Group's report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department. Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced. A budget of €28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170m for the period to 2013. Assistance is also available to sheep farmers for on-farm investments under the new Rural Development Programme. These schemes have only recently been launched and payments have not yet been made.

In accordance with the European Communities (Goat Identification) Regulation 2005 (S.I. 792 of 2005), goats are registered under the National Goat Identification Scheme for animal health purposes.Goat farming serves a small niche market for dairy and meat products. My Department provides grant-aid to eligible farmers for, inter alia, construction of goat housing, handling facilities and fencing under the Farm Improvement Scheme introduced last July. The maximum eligible investment ceiling under the Scheme is €120,000 and the standard grant-rate is 40%.  Aid for fencing is limited to an overall eligible investment ceiling of €20,000.

On-farm capital investment, training, advice, quality, breeding and establishment of energy crops will also be assisted.Environment (€6bn) — The rural environment protection scheme and related support for Natura 2000 will account for some €3 billion. A 17% increase in rates and enhanced options will build on the scheme's already substantial positive contribution. There will be an 8% increase in disadvantaged areas scheme payments and a 15% increase in forestry premiums. Support will also be provided for animal welfare in the suckler herd and for the organic sector.Food Industry (€289m) — This amount relates specifically to investment in capital infrastructure and marketing. The food industry will also benefit from general industry provisions elsewhere in the NDP and from the huge investment in transport and other infrastructure that is key to continuing competitiveness.Agri-Food Research (€641m) — Actions under this sub-programme will provide scientific support to the sector. They will assist the generation of new knowledge and technologies that are critical to the growth of a market-orientated and sustainable industry.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	555	Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. It is not unusual for some second-level schools to prioritise named feeder schools in their admissions policies. This often reflects long standing connections between certain schools.However, in formulating an admissions policy a school must ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.  Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  Otherwise, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

There are no plans to extend this initiative to cover third level institutions in Northern Ireland.  Under my Department's Higher Education Grant Schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU Member States, including Northern Ireland. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. However the payment of undergraduate tuition fees under these schemes does not extend to approved courses outside the State and there are no plans to change this position at present.It is understood however that students attending Higher Education Institutions in Northern Ireland and who are ordinarily resident in a Member State of the European Union will be eligible for a fee loan from the Northern Ireland Authorities up to the amount charged by the Higher Education Institution. Further clarification can be sought by the individual from Department of Employment and Learning in the Northern Ireland. Their e-mail address is studentfinance@delni.gov.uk.Section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 also provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate of tax in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 to 200, inclusive, together.The funding arrangements for existing recognised schools and the terms governing those arrangements are set out in Department circulars and notices including the arrangements for the payment of additional monies to schools having regard to the level of educational disadvantage of students in schools. These arrangements carry from year to year and amendments, which generally involve improvements to those funding arrangements, are published in the context of the estimates and budgetary process as agreed with the Minister for Finance.In relation to any request that might be received in the context of Section 8 of the Education Act, 1998 from an intending patron to establish a new recognised second level school, I have in my answer to Question 110 of 2 October 2007 stated that recognition will not be granted for a school that proposes to charge fees.There are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant, 2 Inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remainder Catholic. Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive capitation or related supports. A payment is made to the Central Protestant Churches authority — the Secondary Education Committee — of a grant (the Protestant Block Grant) for distribution among needier Protestant students to enable them to meet the cost of attending Protestant schools. The grant is calculated by reference to the number of pupils in Protestant schools, on a broadly similar basis to the per capita grant payable to schools in the Free Education Scheme. Applications for assistance are made to the Committee by parents which on the basis of a means test distributes the funds by individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.  In addition, Protestant fee-charging schools are eligible for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant, the secretarial grant and caretaking grant.Minority religion schools also receive capital funding for building projects and have done so under successive Governments on the same basis as other secondary schools, while approximately 50% of capital costs for Catholic fee-charging schools building projects are met by the State. However, school building projects, whether for fee charging schools or schools in the free education sector, are selected for inclusion in the Schools' Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need. In that regard the Deputy should note that the proportion of the school building programme spent in fee-charging schools in recent years has been extremely small.As with all public expenditure measures I will keep the funding arrangements for the schools concerned under review to ensure that they remain consistent with their original policy basis. If these arrangements were subjected to legal challenge and it was determined that the Protestant block grant offends the Constitution, clearly I would have to cease payment of the grant.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.Schools receiving State aid, including denominational schools, take into account the wishes of parents in relation to the religious education of their children, including the wishes of parents who may not want to have their children follow any programme of religious education and this is provided for in Section 30 of the 1998 Education Act.  As the Deputy will be aware, the vast majority of our primary schools were set up by religious authorities, in the main by the Catholic Church. However, they have historically welcomed pupils from all backgrounds and continue to do so. In fact, many Catholic schools now have large numbers of newcomer children with a diversity of faiths enrolled.In order to provide greater choice and to cater for the requirements of an increasingly pluralist society, my Department is developing a new model of primary school patronage which will cater for the diversity of religious faiths represented in growing urban areas. It is also intended to cater for the wishes of parents who do not wish to have their children follow a programme of religious instruction.  This new model of community primary school will be piloted next year in Dublin under the patronage of Co. Dublin VEC. Consultations have taken place with all of the education partners in the context of the development of this new model of patronage and many of the issues mentioned by the Deputy have arisen in the course of these consultations.I accept that providing sufficient pupil places in all rapidly developing areas, including those with large immigrant communities, is absolutely vital to ensuring that enrolment policies do not lead to the exclusion of any child on religious or ethnic grounds and to this end, the Government is committed to substantially increasing the level of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas under the €4.5 billion school building programme included in the National Development Plan.  The Government is also committed to integration as set out in the National Action Plan against Racism and it is the policy of my Department to ensure there is no discrimination in the provision of education in this country.

I consider that in the case of primary school teacher training it is essential that participants applying for the course meet the required criteria, as currently set down, which are common to all Colleges of Education that provide teacher training, and which include an honours level primary degree (a degree at Level 8 on the National Qualifications Framework).

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-18 00:00:00	Prelude	564	Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund, was a scheme addressing educational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department's DEIS programme; schools in, or serving, RAPID areas; and special schools.The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures. The four measures are: (1) Outdoor Play Facilities; (2) Libraries; (3) Parent Rooms; and (4) Dining Areas.  Eligible schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  Proposals were sought in respect of improvements to existing facilities ('enhancements' or ‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities ('new-builds').A total of €20.5m, (€14.5m from the Dormant Accounts and €6m from the RAPID Leverage Fund, which is administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs), has been made available to fund the scheme.  The scheme was launched on 16th January 2007, with a closing date for applications of 1st March 2007.  The scheme was very heavily over-subscribed with 2,271 individual project proposals submitted for funding. The total amount of grant aid sought greatly exceeded the funding available under the scheme.In light of the very large number of project proposals received and the level of oversubscription the Dormant Accounts Fund Inter-departmental Educational Disadvantage Committee recommended that arrangements should be made to transfer some 300 new-build proposals, including the one referred to by the Deputy, to the Department's Planning and Building Unit for considered for funding in the context of the Department's overall Schools Building and Modernisation Programme and available resources.  These new build proposals have recently been transferred to the Planning and Building Unit. However, given the number of proposals and the scale of the Modernisation Programme assessing these applications will take some considerable time.

It was recognised that while the vast majority of teachers fulfil their teaching function and professional duties adequately and well, there are, as in all professions, a small number of under performing personnel in schools.In that context discussions under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council have commenced to review and revise existing procedures for the suspension and dismissal of teachers. One of the issues under consideration is the provision of assistance, where appropriate, to teachers who are experiencing professional difficulties as provided for in the Towards 2016 agreement.The Teachers Conciliation Council is the recognised forum for dealing with matters relating to pay and conditions of service of teachers.  The parties to the forum include representatives of the managerial authorities of schools, the teacher unions and the Departments of Education and Science and Finance.  As the proceedings of the Conciliation Council are confidential it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.

St. Patrick's College commenced the scheme in 2004, Mary Immaculate in 2005. Details on the numbers of entrants under this scheme to these Colleges are provided below. The minimum entry requirements specified by my Department for admission to the B.Ed. programme applies to entrants via this scheme in the same way as to all other applicants.The other three Colleges of Education — Froebel, Colaiste Mhuire, Marino and CICE are officially part of the Higher Education Direct Access Route (HEAR), which prior to 2005 was known as the Higher Education Direct Access Scheme (HEDAS). Under this scheme there is a 15% maximum intake for the disadvantaged, disabled, and mature streams in aggregate. It is roughly 5% for each of the three categories but this will vary from year to year according to the number of applications received.

My Department's Third Level Student Maintenance Grant Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.  The candidate should, therefore, apply to their relevant awarding body in the first instance.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.  Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

This funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas.  This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas. €428m of this year's budget had been spent by the end of September.€4.5 billion will be provided under the new National Development Plan (NDP) for investment in school building infrastructure. The main focus of the school building programme is to deliver additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas. It is projected that 100,000 additional school places will be required over the next number of years and these are being delivered. The funding under the NDP 2007-2013 will allow my Department to continue the acceleration of the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested on school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.

The Back to Education Initiative provides new opportunities for learning through the provision of flexible part-time and full-time programmes that consolidate and build on existing further education services. It provides a progression route for school leavers and a re-entry route for those adults who wish to update their skills at levels 1-6 on the National Framework of Qualifications. The Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) and Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) programmes comprise the full time educational options under this initiative.  The BTEI is the part time programme available.Expenditure on the Back to Education Initiative, full and part time, between 2000 and 2006 amounted to €587.1 million. A total of €57.7 million of this expenditure was spent on the part time component of the initiative from 2002, when it commenced, up to the end of December 2006.  It is estimated that provision for the full time and part time components of the Back to Education Initiative under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will be in the region of €1,764.6 million.

The benefit of passport free travel does not apply to persons who are not Irish or British citizens.  Nor does the operation of the Common Travel Area do away with the obligation on a visa required person to be in possession of a valid visa when entering the State.The Immigration Act 2004 (Visas)(No.2) Order 2006 (SI No. 657 of 2006) sets out the classes of persons who are not required to obtain an Irish entry visa.  Classes of Non-EEA nationals who are not set out in that Order are required to be in possession of a visa upon arrival in Ireland, regardless of whether that arrival is from within the Common Travel or otherwise.  In addition, non-EEA nationals when travelling within the Common Travel Area are subject to the requirement to present to an immigration officer in accordance with section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004.  Such persons may be refused permission to enter or be in the State if not in receipt of appropriate documentation, including a visa where so required.  The section further provides that a person who enters the State in contravention of certain requirements set out in that section, including the requirement to be in possession of a valid visa where so required, is guilty of an offence.I am, of course, conscious of the fact that the sharing of a land border within the Common Travel Area can be open to abuse by those seeking to gain illegal entry to the State.  The situation in this regard is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department in consultation with their counterparts in the United Kingdom.I should also mention that the visa regime generally, including the question of re-entry for certain categories of person with permission to reside in the State, is currently under examination in the context of the forthcoming Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.

All Gardaí have a responsibility, inter alia, to be involved in Community Policing issues as they arise.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to retirements, resignations etc.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when the next allocation of Probationer Gardaí takes place on the 23 November 2007, the needs of the Southern Region, which includes the Cork Divisions, will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.I understand that the Central Statistics Office is currently preparing the Small Area Population Statistics (SAPS) based on the 2006 census.  It is not expected that these SAPS figures will be available until mid-November 2007.

The persons concerned were all EU citizens.  Like all EU citizens their rights to move to and reside in Ireland are set out in the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No.2) Regulations 2006 which transpose the relevant Directive.The Regulations state that EU citizens may reside in Ireland for up to 3 months without conditions.  The persons may reside in the Member State for longer than 3 months if he/she:— (i) is in employment or is self-employed in the State, (ii) has sufficient resources to support himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants, and has comprehensive sickness insurance in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants, (iii) is enrolled in an educational establishment in the State for the principal purpose of following a course of study there, including a vocational training course, and has comprehensive sickness insurance in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse and any accompanying dependants, or (iv) is a family member accompanying or joining a Union citizen who satisfies one or more of the conditions referred to in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above.In the case of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals, they have the right to work in the State on condition that they obtain the necessary employment permits unless they are otherwise exempt from employment permit requirements.  The above Regulations provide for a removal process in respect of EU citizens on a number of grounds including where "in the opinion of the Minister, the conduct or activity of the person is such that it would be contrary to public policy or it would endanger public security or public health to permit the person to remain in the State". (Regulation 20(1)(a)(iv)).The situation in relation to the illegal encampment obviously gave rise to serious concerns on the grounds of public policy impinging on a number of state agencies and the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  Various discussions took place between the parties.  Having considered the matter in line with the Regulations I concluded that the conduct of the persons involved presented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the safety and well-being of themselves, their children and members of the public.  An offer of free flights to their homeland was made to the group.  This offer was refused.My Department then initiated a removal process pursuant to Regulation 20 of the above Regulations.  Following the service of proposal to remove letters by members of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, all of the Romanian families involved decided to voluntarily repatriate to Romania.I believe that this difficult matter was dealt with very effectively by the GNIB and that the experience of this case will be of benefit in the event of other similar cases arising in the future.  It is important of course that each case is considered on its merits and in line with the Regulations.  It must be borne in mind finally that this case involved a substantial abuse of the rights of free movement afforded to EU citizens and that such abuses are not acceptable.

The Directive is being implemented in Ireland in relation to the non-domestic sector, which includes those engaged in the provision of educational services, on the basis of recovery of all non-domestic water services costs from non-domestic users of the services through water charges by means of a meter based volumetric charge to ensure charging accords to actual consumption.  There is no provision for the exemption of any classes of non-domestic users from water charges.The Education section of the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the provision of a water allowance to schools, with charges becoming effective after such allowance is exceeded.  It will be necessary for any proposals to assist schools in meeting this aspect of their running costs to be framed in a way that is consistent with Ireland's obligations under the Water Framework Directive and my Department will co-operate with the Department of Education and Science in examining this issue.

Three new schemes are to be introduced, a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, a Mobility Aids Grant Scheme, and a scheme of Housing Aid for Older People.  The new framework of grants will become operational on 1 November 2007.The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will assist in the provision/adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  The grant will be increased from the current effective maximum of €20,320 to a maximum of €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the cost of works.  Prioritisation of eligibility will be on the basis of medical and financial need with 95% of the approved cost of work available to those with annual household incomes of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme will provide grants to cover a basic suite of works to address mobility problems primarily but not exclusively associated with aging.  It will fast track grant aid to people on lower incomes (maximum annual household income threshold €30,000).  The maximum grant available will be €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works.The new Housing Aid for Older People scheme will provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people, and amalgamates the provisions of the existing Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Schemes. The maximum grant available will be €10,500 and may cover 100% of the cost of works for applicants with an annual household income of less than €30,000, tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of €54,001 to €65,000.In the case of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, it has been agreed with the Health Service Executive that, in order to facilitate transitional arrangements, the scheme will continue to operate, and be administered by the Health Service Executive until 31 March 2008.  All applications received up to this date will be processed by the Health Service Executive under the existing terms and conditions governing the scheme.

Issues to be considered in the Green Paper include the provision of quality customer service to the public and ensuring a proper balance of power at local levels between the manager and the elected representatives. Work on the Green Paper should be finalised by the end of the year, with a White Paper to follow next year.Notwithstanding that improving customer service will be a cornerstone of the local government reform process, it should be noted that local authorities have led the way on a range of initiatives aimed at improving service delivery in recent years. These include customer action plans, the decentralisation of services, a greater focus on the use of ICT to deliver services, the putting in place of customer complaint and consultation procedures, and the introduction of local government wide service indicators. The third annual Service Indicators Report, which was published in August 2007, measured the performance of local authorities across a range of services in a uniform way.

Ireland's list of designated ports is designed to be a balance between the needs of the Industry and the level of resources which must be made available by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority at each designated port to fulfil its responsibility under European and National law.Union Hall and Castletownbere are designated ports for the purposes of landing Monkfish and Hake in the West Cork area.  The requirement for whitefish vessels to land into designated ports only applies when the landings exceed a significant quantity for specified stocks.  There is no restriction on whitefish vessels landing in non-designated ports if the quantities on board are below the threshold levels for the specified species.I am therefore satisfied that there is a designated port within reasonable range of fishing vessels wishing to land in the vicinity. Furthermore, I am also satisfied that there are no circumstances where the Control Authorities would give precedence to their regulatory responsibilities over consideration for the safety of a fishing vessel or its crew.

As regards the 2007-2013 NDP, a figure of €435 million was allocated to the Communications and Broadband Programme.  €28.6 million has been spent to date.  It is anticipated that the full €435 million will be fully utilised over the lifetime of the programme.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department will undertake initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  Over the 2007-2013 period, the current phase of the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) programme will be completed. Consideration will be given to a further phase of the MANs once the effectiveness of spending under the first phase has been addressed. The National Broadband Scheme which aims to provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved is also under development. This scheme, which will also be funded under the 2007-2013 Plan, will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.
