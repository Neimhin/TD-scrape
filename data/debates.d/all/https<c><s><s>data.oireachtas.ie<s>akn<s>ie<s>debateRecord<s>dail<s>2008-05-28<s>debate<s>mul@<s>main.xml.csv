#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Bhí mé ag éisteacht le Clare FM agus chuala mé gur inniu lá breithe an Cheann Comhairle.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leat, a Cheann Comhairle, os rud é go bhfuil tú sa Chathaoir mhór chumhachtach chompordach sin.I wish to ask the Taoiseach a question about an issue I consider is really important in the context of our future.  In interviews the Taoiseach has given in recent weeks he has quite rightly spoken of that future and of the requirement to invest in it with particular relevance to information technology, research and development.  When he has been questioned he has replied consistently in the context of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 which, in his own words, is to transform Ireland and provide a better quality of life for all our people, young and old.In that context I ask the Taoiseach about the commitment in that national development plan, on page 199, which deals with an investment of €252 million in information and computer technology for schools.  This is a mess.  There is less than one computer for every ten pupils and less than one in five is actually working.  There is inconsistency in terms of the replacement of hardware.  Broadband is not available in a number of schools.  The situation, as far as the future is concerned which the Taoiseach has pointed out as being important, is all over the place.  Will the commitment in the national development plan to invest €252 million over the next seven years be delivered in full and spent in full?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	1	That will depend on the budgetary parameters as we go through the next seven years.  With respect, the assumptions which are set out in the plan are predicated on growth of more than 4.5% per annum.  I have been making the point, generally speaking, that it is important that we prioritise investment to those areas which will improve competitiveness and ensure we continue to see investment coming to the country to create jobs and maintain and grow wealth for the country in order that we can develop public services.Specifically, in regard to the whole question of the role information communications technology can play in the furtherance and development of our education system, at primary, second and other levels, it is important that we provide a priority for that area.  As the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, that is done in the context of the Estimates process.  I have heard from the Opposition, quite rightly, taking into account the change in the international environment in which we operate, the need to maintain our commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact by providing broadly balanced budgets going forward; this is an issue that has to be considered in that context.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	This is the first admission from the Taoiseach that the national development plan is not secure and that the commitments entered into in it will no longer stand up.  Last week, the Fine Gael spokesman on education, Deputy Brian Hayes, asked the newly appointed Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, if this money would be spent over the period of the plan.  He said this was now an aspiration;  following on the words of his predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, who said, in respect of class sizes and pupil teacher ratios that this was also an aspiration.I remind the Taoiseach of what he said, as Minister for Finance, last December in his budget speech:The national development plan is my top priority.  Postponing or delaying it would be a major policy error. ...  I am determined to roll it out as planned and thereby secure our future.We are now being told by the Taoiseach that this is all predicated on prevailing financial circumstances.  This will come as a complete shock and an absolute disappointment to the hundreds of thousands of pupils, teachers and parents throughout the country who will find that their schools are inadequately resourced in terms of ICT to compete with what is happening abroad and the challenges we face in the future.  If it means this is no longer a commitment, where stands the national development plan?  Where stands the commitment to metro north, the children's hospital etc.?The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said there is not a red cent in the coffers to build a hospital in the north east.  If the Taoiseach is saying that the national development plan does not stand up in terms of commitments, will he prioritise what he has said that for young people the future lies in what is between their ears and what we can give them in terms of that information resource and technology?  The commitment to invest €252 million over seven years is an investment in the future.  As Taoiseach, whose foreword — Transforming Ireland, A Better Quality of Life — is in this plan, will he give a commitment that at least this element of the national development plan will be honoured in full as he said last December when he delivered his Budget Statement as Minister for Finace?  The future jobs, the future economic expansion of this country, the future careers of thousands of young people currently in primary school and starting secondary school depend on his answer.

As I have said, the commitment I hear from the Opposition depends on the day of the week and what spokesman I listen to.  On the one hand, it speaks about the deterioration of the public finances and then says we are not spending a sufficient amount, as the Leader of the Opposition said today.

In regard to what I am going to do and what this Government will do, we will prioritise investments in those areas which will be most productive for the economy and for society. Education has been an area where, since this Government took office in 1997, we have consistently expanded and increased investment on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so.  We will have to do so as members of the euro area in compliance with Stability and Growth Pact commitments which affect all governments.  That requires us to keep a broad budgetary balance which is an issue on which the Opposition spokesman on finance has been speaking.In regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, an expert group was set up by our previous Minister for Education and Science, which reported at the beginning of the year on the expenditure on the hardware, software, technical support and teacher training.  Implementation of the plan is being considered.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I am making the broader point, one which will affect whoever is in government in the years ahead, that we have to take cognisance of the international economic environment from which we cannot be immune.  We have certain commitments with which we have to contend and in the meantime we will prioritise investments in the productive sectors of the economy, including education, physical infrastructure, social expenditure and other areas, on the basis that, year on year as our Estimates are being prepared, we come forward with proposals which give priority to those areas.  That is what we will do.

Last week, we had the story of failures in X-ray services in the north east.  Last Monday night, a "Prime Time Investigates" programme showed the dilapidation of our health service, including the case of an elderly woman trying to cope with caring for her husband, a stroke victim, without a home help.  Medical experts are warning of a diabetes epidemic and we have the continuing trend towards the privatisation of the health service.Today we learn that 100 jobs are to be cut in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  I understand those affected are mainly agency and temporary workers who have been taken on by the hospital because the recruitment embargo prevented it from recruiting in the normal manner.  We are told, by way of a circular issued by the hospital yesterday, that 100 staff will be removed from the hospital because the Health Service Executive has given it €14 million less than its projected expenditure this year.  One cannot take 100 staff out of a hospital without affecting patient services.  This measure will inevitably result in sick children not getting the treatment they need in the hospital and parents of sick children being told their child will have to wait because the hospital is unable to provide the services it should provide.All the crises in the health service come back to the failure of the HSE, the instrument established by the Government to run the health services, to manage the health service properly.  I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, what will be done to ensure Crumlin hospital has the staff it requires to treat the sick children who present for treatment and to assure the House that in different economic circumstances, cuts in expenditure will not be made in areas which affect the most vulnerable, among whom are children who are ill and need treatment?  Second, will the Taoiseach take up the proposals developed by the Labour Party's spokesperson on health, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and published by my party last week for the reform of the health service and, in particular, the HSE?  It is manifestly clear the HSE is not managing and running the health service to deliver the quality of care required.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I remind the Deputy he was a member of a Government which unanimously agreed that, based on bitter experience in the past, the best way of trying to develop the health services was to introduce service planning.  On the basis of allocations provided to hospitals, service plans would be drawn up and adhered to in the interests of maintaining a level of service that had been provided on an ongoing basis and building incrementally, year on year thereafter, in the event of further investment being made in the health service.  This was unanimously agreed at the time and I was the first Minister for Health to introduce and live by those disciplines.On the particular issue which has arisen in Crumlin hospital, the problem in relation to service planning is that there was an overspend of €10 million last year and the projected overspend, on an increase in the allocation from €128 million in 2007 to €137 million this year and an increase in the hospital's budget of almost 40% over the past four years, is of a further €14 million beyond the €137 million figure.  What is being said and must be accepted by all of us is that if we are to have planned and sustainable improvements in the health service, quite apart from the reforms being put forward by the HSE to build greater community care services in order that services are not all taken up at the acute hospital end, we also have to maintain the reforms introduced by previous Governments, including the one of which the Deputy was a member.  Service plans have to be adhered to in the interests of developing services in the short and longer term.The Opposition now appears to suggest that we can develop a health service based on the demand led system of budgets regardless of what budgets are allocated to which hospitals.  The idea that this approach rather than trying to adhere to the budgetary disciplines required would not create even greater dislocation or more problems escapes me.  That is the position in relation to Crumlin hospital.What is being required is that we try to live within existing allocations.  Owing to the good work Crumlin hospital has been doing and its important work nationally, an agreement was made to deal on a once off basis with last year's overrun of €10 million and provide a further €7 million in respect of a projected overrun of €14 million this year, while requiring the hospital to work within its budget which will be amended from €137 million to €144 million this year based on an allocation of €128 million last year.  That is what is being required of the hospital and consultation is ongoing between management and representatives to determine how to meet this requirement.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Some 70% of the hospital's costs are staff related.  The employment of temporary and agency workers cannot continue on an ongoing basis.  No permanent positions are being cut or anything like that.  The hospital must be managed within its allocation.  Otherwise, as the Deputy knows, under the law introduced under the Administration of which he was a member and with which I agree and supported at the time, the overrun will become a first charge on the allocation for the following year, which places even greater pressure on the hospital's ability to maintain the agreed level of service.  We all agreed on this approach in the interests of trying to provide a means by which we have some sense of budgetary and management discipline in delivery of the health service.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	20	When parents show up in Crumlin hospital with a sick child, they will not want to hear about service planning, budgetary discipline, the millions of euro allocated in this or that year or which Administration introduced what legislation.  They will want to have their child attended to and cared for.  If there are 100 fewer staff in the hospital, this will be less likely and it will be more likely they will be told to go away and wait.  The job of the Taoiseach, Government and HSE, the body the Government set up to run the health service properly, is to have this problem fixed and the issues of service planning, budgetary planning and so on sorted out because patients, the people suffering at the receiving end of a health service that is not working, do not want to hear these excuses.  They want to get better, be cured and secure the services they need in our hospitals.  The problem is that the body the Government set up to run the health service is not doing its job efficiently.Last week, the Labour Party published a set of proposals on the reforms required in the HSE to put right this problem, including a proposal to introduce a voluntary scheme to remove from the Health Service Executive the overlapping layers of management, administration and bureaucracy which appear to be getting in the way and eating budgets which should be used to provide the staff required at the front line to deliver the service in hospitals and health centres.  We are long past the stage of arguing about budgetary discipline, service planning and all this gobbledegook——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	21	It is not gobbledegook.

It is gobbledegook to a parent who comes into a hospital with a sick child but is told that the child cannot receive any service.  The Taoiseach must sort this out and reform the HSE so that we do not end up in a situation where different hospitals or services are not functioning from one week to the next.  It is long past time to sort out the mess in the health service, reform the HSE and provide the care to patients for which taxpayers are paying.

The problem can be solved by supporting the reforms that we are trying to bring about, which will ensure that we have greater investment in community care.  We cannot have a situation where the acute hospital sector takes up all the allocation to the extent that it is currently doing.  We must reform the health service, as Professor Drumm said yesterday in the interview he gave in response to this programme.

However, the status quo will not solve the problem.  If the suggestion from Deputy Gilmore is that nobody wants to hear about the budgetary situation, then I am sure that is true.  However, if one is in the job, then one must work within those budgets.  If the Deputy was in my position, he would have to do the same.  The only way we can solve that problem is by working with those who are trying to implement the reforms on the basis of increased allocations.Resources are being increased significantly.  An extra €5 billion has gone into the health service in the past four years, yet perennial problems arise and we are trying to deal with them.  The only way we can do that is for everybody to change the structures by which the system is being delivered.  That is the truth of it.  The Health Service Executive is involved in making those changes.

Reforms are being implemented and primary care is a critical part of those reforms.  The amendment of the consultants' contracts, by bringing them into clinical directorates in hospitals, and the management of services in our hospitals are an important part of that.The fundamental point is that allocations have been increased and there has been no cutback in the amount of money being provided.  When we make the allocation, we must ensure that the service plans work to those allocations.  Otherwise, as the Deputy knows — this is not gobbledegook — the legal position is that this will be a first charge on whatever goes in next year.  That will greatly undermine the ability of the staff and the management who are working hard to provide the level of service that is currently being provided.

We must start from the reality that there are finite budgets, however much they are increased, and we hope to increase them again in the future.  The amount of resources going into the health service in the past five to six years is unprecedented.  As Professor Drumm said, we must ally resource allocation with reform in the delivery of the service.  Otherwise, we will continue to have the sort of debates we have been having until now, with no prospect of a solution.

In the course of these visits, he met with President Bush, where they discussed the issue of the undocumented Irish as well as a range of international issues.He also met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and with Congressman Richie Neal and the Friends of Ireland group, Governor Deval Patrick and with Senator Hillary Clinton, while he spoke by telephone to Senator Barak Obama.  He also met with Senator Ted Kennedy in the course of his visits and I know that this House would wish to convey our best wishes to Senator Kennedy at this time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I am sure we all wish Senator Kennedy all the best in his challenge to deal with a serious health problem.What are the new Taoiseach's views on the undocumented Irish?  I am aware of the complexity of this matter.  The Kennedy-McCain Bill fell, along with other attempts in this area.  I am also conscious of the fact that the American presidential elections put a constraint upon members of the US Congress who might wish to put forward views or legislative plans in respect of undocumented persons in the US.Does the Taoiseach agree that, following the unanimous adoption of a motion in the House, we should pursue a bilateral arrangement between the US and Ireland for young people from the Twenty-six Counties and from Northern Ireland in a reciprocal fashion?  This country has had a special relationship with the US for 200 years in economic, cultural, political and legal terms.  Other countries seem to have acquired facilities for worker visas on a reciprocal basis.  The Taoiseach will be aware that it is more difficult for a young American to get authorisation to live and work in Ireland than the other way round.The Irish who are currently undocumented in the US do not want an amnesty and a free pass to continue to live there.  They want a legal and political route by which they can earn their keep legitimately in the US.  There are many cases of people who are married, pay their social security, raise their families and contribute to the American economy, but are still undocumented.  As a consequence, they are restricted from coming back here due to family circumstances.  It is a particularly sensitive and sore problem.  It appears that the commitment of the Government faded in the last few months of Deputy Ahern's time as Taoiseach.  I would like the Taoiseach to bring this to a new level and raise it to the right level when he commences discussions with his US counterparts.  The Taoiseach should also build on the platform given unanimously by all parties and Members that we should pursue a bilateral, reciprocal arrangement operating north and south with the US in the interests of dealing with the challenges both countries face in the next 25 years.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	55	There is no basis for making the claim.  Deputy Kenny is aware that the domestic political situation in the US means this is a divisive and difficult issue on which to get a comprehensive approach because the US Congress and Government have sought a comprehensive approach to resolve this.  It has not been possible to resolve it thus far despite the bipartisan efforts of people of such eminence as Senators Kennedy and McCain, two of the most influential Senators in the US Congress.  They were unable to get sufficient support in the Houses of Congress for their proposals or for amendments suggested to their proposals.  Despite the difficult background against which Deputy Kenny acknowledges we have had to operate, all the evidence has been about advocacy and seeking to present a persuasive case but has culminated in serious efforts being made within Congress by the most influential people in Congress to address the issue in a way the Irish Government would like to see it addressed on behalf of our citizens who are undocumented.  That is a fairer reflection of the situation to date.  I do not accept the suggestion that the former Taoiseach was in dereliction of duty in any way.Up to the discussion the former Taoiseach had with President Bush, when he had the honour of addressing both Houses of Congress, I know how assiduously and strongly he put the case from reports of those meetings.  Unfortunately, the indication was that it would be difficult to deal with this matter unless there was a comprehensive approach.  The former Taoiseach continued in the course of those discussions, as I will continue in my office, to seek to persuade the US Government to examine this issue from a number of vantage points in an effort to resolve the matter, even if one must acknowledge and respect the present policy position regarding immigration and the challenges it provides for the US domestically.The former Taoiseach outlined the position of the undocumented Irish in the US.  He expressed the view that in the absence of a comprehensive package a reciprocal arrangement between Ireland and the US should be possible and should be examined.  This could provide the means of allowing Irish people to work legally in the US.  The president was emphatic that, in the absence of a comprehensive package, it would be very difficult to come to an arrangement that would give an advantage to one over any other group.  We hope that through further engagement between our officials and the US Administration, progress could be made on a bilateral agreement to allow Irish people to work legally in the US and for US citizens to work here.Since I became Taoiseach I met with Niall O'Dowd, the chairman of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, on 22 May.  We discussed the issue of the undocumented Irish in a comprehensive fashion.  I thank him for that discussion.  I reiterated the Government's strong commitment to find a resolution of the situation we are facing.  We want to see the position of the undocumented regularised and a beneficial system of bilateral migration arrangements between Ireland and the US put in place.On Monday I met with a congressional delegation led by Senators Patrick Leahy, Thad Cochran and Richard Shelby, and we had detailed discussion on the issue.  I am grateful to all our friends in Congress, across both parties and the US Administration for their help.  I appreciate the efforts they are making on our behalf, and will continue to make even in this election year, to see if there is any means by which we can make progress on the matter.I agree the unanimous resolution of the House is an excellent position for any Government to have.  That unanimity should manifest itself in not denigrating the efforts of the Government in trying to achieve the outcome.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I beg to differ with the Taoiseach.  His predecessor stated that this concern with those who are undocumented amounted to what he described as pub talk in a lot of cases.  This was taken as a deep insult by people from this country working is the US who find themselves in a legal limbo because they are undocumented.  The Government got into some degree of tension with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  When that group went to Washington in March, the secretary dealing with immigration reform was not aware of the House having passed the unanimous motion.What are the vantage points to which the Taoiseach refers when he states he wants to pursue this issue from a number of vantage points?  I will help the Taoiseach if I can.  Those who I met in the Bronx and Yonkers and those who have e-mailed me want a legitimate structure by which they can earn a right to continue to live in the US.  That is the problem, which is part of a bigger picture when there are millions more streaming into the US from many countries.  We have a special relationship with the US for all of those reasons.  It is not a case of dealing with people who want to go to the US in the future for a short-term working career and having a reciprocal arrangement but dealing with the 50,000 who are currently there, married or single, and contributing to the US economy and who want a legitimate facility to continue to live there because that is their wish.  That is where the political effort from the Government should be.The Taoiseach can rest assured of the assistance of this side of the House in building on the platform that was passed by the House.  I would like to see the Taoiseach make this an international priority for his term in office.  This would be in the interests of both countries to have this dealt with in a way that will stand the test of time for those who are currently there and for those who may want to go to the US in the future.  It should be done in reciprocal fashion.The bilateral tax arrangements with the US are due for review next year.  Barack Obama has made comments about the repatriation of American profits and taxes.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about the future in the context of foreign direct investment from the US?  What issues will arise at the review of the bilateral tax arrangements?  Does he expect to have discussions about that in the near future?  Will he meet President Bush before he leaves office?

The remit of the questions does not extend to the supplementary questions being asked by Deputy Kenny.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	61	It is important we deal with the Administration on the basis of settled policy at the time.  There are many things said in the context of electoral contests.  One has to listen to that and note it.  There have been statements, which were they to be followed through in a certain fashion, would cause us some worry.  We must allow the domestic contest to proceed to its finality and then deal with whatever Administration is honoured to serve the people of the United States following the election in November and from January next when the changeover takes place.  We will deal with the issues as they arise.  These types of matters have arisen before and through good diplomatic efforts we have been able to ensure that worst case scenarios never came to pass.  There is a particular atmosphere in the States in regard to these matters which ebb and flow from time to time.  We must await the outcome of the election.  There is no point speculating on these issues in the present context.Regarding the Deputy's first supplementary, I will, as I stated, do all I can.  It is not a matter of contention between the parties as to what the objective of our efforts should be.  Committees of the House maintain contact with their opposite numbers in Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate.  Members of the House from all parties have taken a continuing interest in this matter and have built up a level of expertise that can be utilised through our committee system in terms of organising visits to ensure this matter remains to the forefront.Our ambassador in Washington and his staff continue to seek support in this regard and to explain the creative ideas to which the US might be amenable in an effort to resolve this problem to our satisfaction.  As the Deputy will be aware, the political conditions have not existed to resolve this matter in a way we would like to see it resolved.  We must respect the situation, work around it and continue to seek other means through which we can resolve matters.  We need to explore further with them and to advocate the proposal in respect of a bilateral working visa arrangement while recognising that we are not unique in this situation.  We will also contend that the size of our problem is such as to make it more manageable than would be the case in respect of other ethnic groups.  We are all aware through our constituency work of constituents who are in this unfortunate situation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I join with the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in conveying to Senator Ted Kennedy the good wishes of the Labour Party in his battle to overcome his current illness.The questions being discussed relate to the former Taoiseach's visit to the United States and his meetings with President Bush and other American leaders.  In his meetings with President Bush, did the former Taoiseach raise the issue of the war in Iraq, in particular the concern of Irish people in regard to the continuing slaughter of civilians in Iraq?  If so, what is the view of the US Administration on its continuing engagement in Iraq and does it have any plans to withdraw from Iraq?A report published today by Amnesty International relates to the use of Shannon Airport for the transport of prisoners to centres of torture in third countries.  On previous occasions, taoisigh and Ministers for Foreign Affairs sought and obtained diplomatic assurances from United States leaders that Shannon Airport was not being used in this way.  Did the former Taoiseach raise this issue with President Bush and if so, did he obtain from him an assurance in regard to the use of Shannon Airport?I appreciate President Bush's remaining time in office is relatively short.  Does the Taoiseach propose to meet or communicate with President Bush or the remaining candidates in the presidential election, again acknowledging that people engaged in an election campaign have their own priorities?  Will the Taoiseach take any new initiative in respect of the undocumented Irish given the need to pursue the motion passed by the House in this regard?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I will respond to the Deputy's second question first.  As I stated, I will take every opportunity to progress the efforts not alone of Government but of the Oireachtas as a whole in regard to resolving the issue of the undocumented Irish.  While I do not wish to repeat myself, political conditions in recent times have not been particularly opportune to advance this case.  The domestic political agenda in the United States has taken hold.  This is a particularly sensitive issue in an election year as one would expect.  That being said, we will not be deterred in our efforts.  We will raise the issue diplomatically and politically on every occasion possible.  As I stated, I have already used two occasions in the past week, in meetings with people who have influence or an interest in this matter, to bring to their attention our wishes to work constructively, diplomatically and discreetly with the US Administration, the State Department, Senators and those who would take an initiative on our behalf in Congress to try to advance some of the more recent ideas put forward.  It is generally recognised that a comprehensive approach to immigration is not possible during the tenure of this Congress despite the high profile involvement of some of the most influential US Senators and public representatives in Congress.  That is the current position.  I will do all I can to advance the issue.On the Taoiseach's discussions with President Bush, obviously, they discussed a range of issues, including the situation in Iraq.  The President indicated the US was determined to succeed and to work with President Malachi and others to bring security and stability to Iraq as quickly as possible.  It has been our view that this is not a matter that can be resolved in a security context alone.  While it is important, as security provides the prospect of stability, political factions within Iraq must work together in the interests of the people to provide that stability and in the interests of their being able to manage and conduct their own affairs as an independent country as soon as possible.  It is also important that there are stable and positive relations between the Iraqi Government and its immediate neighbours.  The neighbourhood must not be an area in which forces of instability can continue to operate or where governments would be inimical to the objectives of the government in Iraq to pursue its objective of providing security and stability for the people of Iraq.  This would have been the nature of the exchange between the US President and the former Taoiseach on the issue.The issue of extraordinary rendition was not raised in the context of the discussions that took place.  I make the point however that the Government has set out at length its position on this including in its response to the report of the Irish Human Rights Commission last December.  We are unequivocally opposed to extraordinary rendition and have made this clear to all concerned.  Far from regarding US assurances as worthless, we are fully satisfied on the basis of the legal advice available to us, that we are entitled under international law to rely upon them.  The assurances given to Ireland and confirmed at the highest level are of a particular clarity and comprehensiveness.  They state unequivocally that no prisoners have been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland, nor would they be without our agreement.It remains the case that there is no evidence, nor even a single concrete or credible allegation, that any extraordinary rendition has ever taken place through Ireland.  The Garda has all the powers it needs to investigate any allegations that may be made, including the power to search aircraft on the basis of reasonable suspicion.  A number of such allegations have been investigated and have led to no action.  It is also the case that no other state has adopted the inspection measures of the type which some have recommended.The Government has been open and active on this issue.  The previous Minister for Foreign Affairs is one of only two foreign Ministers to appear before the European Parliament committee investigating the matter.  We have also taken the lead in calling for international action to reform the regulation of civil aviation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	64	As the Taoiseach stated, the Government relies on and accepts the diplomatic assurances it receives from the United States in respect of extraordinary rendition at Shannon.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this is a position that was criticised not only by the Labour Party but also by bodies such as Amnesty International.  What surprises me about the Taoiseach's response is, given that the Government places such high value on these diplomatic assurances, it appears his predecessor did not seek such assurances at his last meeting with President Bush.I am not clear about the Taoiseach's plans in respect of meeting President Bush or Senators McCain, Obama and Clinton.  I appreciate the Senators have other things on their minds.  I understand Senator Obama has an Offaly connection.  Is Offaly big enough for the Taoiseach and Senator Obama?

We wish the company well with its restructuring proposals.Deputy Gilmore asked whether I will meet President Bush.  The honest answer is that I do not know.  He will visit Northern Ireland and I do not know whether I will have an opportunity to meet him then.  I met him on a couple of occasions previously.  I met him when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the US-EU meeting in Dromoland Castle a number of years ago.  I also met Senator McCain in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and I met Senator Clinton.  I have no plans to meet them.  I do not think I am top of the agenda at present.

What hope of success does he hold out to give some expectation to people not only in the United States but also their families and communities at home?  Will he spell out in some way what he envisages as being the end result, the net product, of the collective effort of all concerned?  Does the current presidential election year in the United States offer opportunities that might not have been openly on offer in previous years?Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of extraordinary rendition flights and he offered a customary stonewall response to me in relation to US military aircraft at Shannon.  Given the apparent unwillingness of the Government to alter the current arrangement of the use of Shannon, has a Taoiseach ever put to a US President or someone at any other level in the US Administration, the prospect of the actual use of Garda searches as a means of establishing the factual position on the use of Shannon by US military aircraft to transfer prisoners from one destination to another and, in the context of my question yesterday against the backdrop of the current international conference here addressing certain munitions, that these flights would not also be used to transport munitions on whose use and manufacture this country is involved in seeking a ban?Will the Taoiseach take a more definite position on this matter, particularly in light of the report published yesterday by Amnesty International which indicted the Government on its failure to act heretofore and its reliance entirely on the oral assurance of the Bush regime in the United States, which is not sufficient guarantee or an assurance for a significant swathe of Irish opinion which I believe is well within a majority.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	72	On the question on the undocumented Irish, I indicated to Deputies Kenny and Gilmore as much as I can state on what my approach will be and my determination to continue to seek a solution, emphasising that we need agreement from the other side which has certain concerns and issues to be dealt with in the context of considering our requests or representations.  We must respect that and if we do not do so we will not make much headway.  If we respect it we have some chance of making some headway.  I have always found successive United States Administrations to be very helpful to this country in many ways.  My reciprocal commitment in respect of that relationship will not be selective.  If one wants to have influence one must be prepared to reciprocate.In respect of the hope we can give the undocumented Irish for the future, we simply say to them that we will work diligently, hard and conscientiously on their behalf, trying to maintain friendships and influence, and work with people who are prepared to help us in Congress and Government to see how we can resolve this matter to everyone's satisfaction.  It is not simply an issue of demand, it is an issue of recognising that the status of the people involved is unsatisfactory for themselves, from the Government's point of view and from the point of view of the US.  We are trying to find a means by which we can regularise that situation.  I have always felt that if we want to do that, unlike others, I would not be selective in my approach.On the other matter, which is totally unrelated, we are simply adopting the same policy that has been adopted for 50 years by successive Governments.  The Deputy is requesting me to change that policy, but that was considered in the House and was rejected.  In a previous response I outlined to Deputy Gilmore the powers of the Garda in this matter.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 17, inclusive, together.On 10 March, my predecessor, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, met Gerry Adams and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, in Government Buildings.  During the meeting, they discussed the devolution of policing and justice, the upcoming investment conference and general North-South issues.In the period around the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, he participated in events both here and in Belfast, including a conference held by the Institute of British Irish Studies in UCD, following which he met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Shaun Woodward, and a symposium on the Agreement in Belfast, which was attended by many of the participants in the negotiations which led to the Agreement.On Thursday, 8 May, I visited Belfast where I participated in the US Northern Ireland investment conference.  Before attending the conference, I had a bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown, where we discussed matters relating to Northern Ireland and affirmed our commitment to the peace process.  We both met the Northern Ireland First Minister, Dr. Ian Paisley, and Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, before addressing business leaders participating in the US investment conference.  Dr. Paisley did a considerable job in leading his party into power sharing government.  While considerable progress has been made during his time as First Minister, the St. Andrews Agreement has yet to be fully implemented.  I believe the time is now right for his successor, Peter Robinson, to take the final steps towards full devolution through the transfer of powers on policing and justice and the implementation of what was agreed at St. Andrews.The investment conference was an important opportunity to showcase what Northern Ireland has to offer international investors.  In the course of the day, I also met US Special Envoy, Paula Dobriansky, who greatly assisted in the organisation of the conference, and the New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and I had an opportunity to meet a number of party leaders and representatives in attendance

We are in the last few days in May.  I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that the time is now right for the transfer of these powers, with which I fully concur.  Is the Taoiseach aware the setting of a clear and realisable date for the transfer of these powers was crucial in winning nationalist republican support for engagement with the new policing structures in the North?  In light of all of that and all that depends upon the delivery of commitments entered into under both agreements, what steps does he propose to take to help ensure the transfer of these powers proceeds over the remaining time, particularly given that there will be shortly a transfer of responsibility from the current First Minister to the First Minister designate, Peter Robinson?  Will the transfer happen prior to the departure of Dr. Paisley?  How soon after the taking up of office by Peter Robinson does the Taoiseach expect these powers to be transferred?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I will write to Deputy Gilmore regarding the Justice for the Forgotten issue because I do not have the information.We are working hard to establish the North-South parliamentary body.  It was envisaged the full complement of the institutional architecture of the Agreement should be implemented in the spirit and word of the Agreement.  We have been quite patient and we have made every effort to overcome past reluctance by others to join such parliamentary bodies in the past.  We had a problem with the body set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement for many years.  There is no principled objection.  It is a question of bedding down the assembly during the course of this year and I hope people will approach these issues positively as quickly as possible and enable the parliamentary arm of the architecture to be used to its full potential.Many of the breakthroughs we have witnessed were the result of parliamentary and local representatives contacts down the years where practical co-operative arrangements were arrived at and people were able to get on with joint approaches on a range of issues, which built confidence over time for much greater commitment and engagement on larger issues that have thankfully been resolved, we hope, to everyone's satisfaction.  I attach importance to these issues, which are not pro forma ideas.  They are important in sustaining contact and improving understanding over time and, thereby, helping people to build relationships that are of value not only in political terms, but also in human terms.It is important the final element of the St. Andrews Agreement, that is, the devolution of policing and justice functions, which is outstanding, should proceed.  We will continue our efforts in that regard.  Progress needs to be made on a timeframe and operational framework and I hope that can be achieved as soon and as quickly as possible in line with the spirit of the St. Andrews Agreement.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12957	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need by the HSE to appoint more occupational therapists in order that people in my constituency of Cork East are not waiting for periods of up to six months and beyond to receive an occupational therapist report for the purposes of applying for a housing aid for older people grant where essential and quality of life enhancing modifications are made to their homes without which they would be unable to function comfortably.

The point I am making is that the Government Chief Whip sent out an edict telling Members to be here on Thursdays and that there will be no pairs or arrangements.  Yet for next Thursday, there are nine engagements by Ministers and Ministers of State at various locations around the country which are the responsibility of the Ministers and the Government in determining——

If we are to follow the edict of the Government Chief Whip, arrangements should be made that no Ministers attend functions that are not entirely in the national interest or in the interests of international business, for which this party has always been willing to give pairs.  We need clarity from the Government Chief Whip.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I cannot allow this.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	98	No Minister or Minister of State should be arranging for road or school openings or the attending of conferences.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows, the Deputies in those constituencies will also want to be in attendance and will be breaching the edict sent out by the Government Chief Whip.  I am only trying to help him by offering him some assistance as one who did some of that business myself.

These are matters that could be arranged at a time when the Dáil is not sitting, where they would not interfere with Deputies of the Government parties being present in the House on Thursdays in accordance with the edict of the Government Chief Whip.  We can require them to be here in a way according to that and I am only trying to be helpful.  These arrangements can be made in such a way that they would not apply like that in future.  I would say that this was in order.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	102	On 9 January last, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government established a committee to review the electoral boundaries for local elections.  He gave that committee the requirement that it had to report before 20 June.  Under the terms of reference he gave to the committee, it is quite clear there will be quite significant changes in electoral boundaries for the local elections.I have two questions for the Taoiseach in respect of that.  Has the Minister received that report?  Can we get an assurance that it will be published straightaway when he receives it?  This report will contain the proposed boundaries for the local elections next year.  It is in the interests of electoral fairness that those boundaries would be known to all political parties and not just those in government when that committee presents its report.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I do not believe the report has been submitted at this stage.  The publication arrangements will be the normal ones in respect of these matters.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	104	That is the problem.  The problem has been that in the past, local election boundaries have been kept under wraps until the very last moment.  A committee has been established to deal with this.  It is a new procedure under the Local Government Act 2001.  I am asking for an assurance that when the report is received by the Minister, it will be published and made available straightaway.  There is a deadline for the submission of the report, which is 20 June, so it will be in this session of the Dáil.  I am asking the Taoiseach for an assurance that it will be published straightaway.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	105	It will be published in the normal way.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	107	There is no significance to what I am saying.  It will be published in the normal way.  When it comes to the Minister, he deals with and considers it.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Reports can take months to be published.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	109	It will not take months to be published.  It will be published as soon as possible and practicable after the Government has had a chance to look at it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	110	As I understand it, this is procedure which is relatively new.  I think it comes under the Local Government Act 2001.  I do not think we have been around this track before.  I understand that it is the first review of local government boundaries since 1998 so there is no normal way.  This is not something that comes up every year but is a one-off report that looks at the populations involved.  The terms of reference it was given state that the minimum number of seats must be four and the maximum seven.  It will involve very significant changes in local election boundaries.All of the political parties who are preparing and organising themselves for local elections and holding selection conventions need to know what the boundaries are.  People out there who might be contemplating standing in local elections need to know the local election boundaries.  What I am asking for is very simple.  The Taoiseach said that the Minister has not yet received the report.  This is a report that must be presented by 20 June.  That report will land on the Minister's desk some time between now and 20 June.  I simply want an assurance that this report will be published and made available to us, not on the same day, but within a few days, being reasonable about it, and that a situation will not arise where the Government parties are in possession of the electoral boundaries for the local elections and the rest of us must wait until next September or October.

This Bill is long overdue and we urgently need it because many elderly people are living in fear across the country and are being attacked on a daily basis by gangs from this city.

There are only two sitting days in the Dáil next week, followed by a break for a week and then there are only nine sitting days remaining before the summer recess.  I want the Taoiseach to assure us that we will have adequate time to discuss this Bill, given that, as I understand it, there have already been 14 redrafts of it.  It is complex and impacts on everyone in this country and we need a proper and full debate.  The Bill should not be guillotined like the Health (Amendment) Bill just before Christmas.

It is two weeks later at this stage and as Deputy Reilly said, there is quite a short amount of time left for Dáil business.  We must ensure we have time to consult and listen to the interests involved.  If the Bill is not published this week I do not think we will have time to deal with it before the summer recess.

In the justice area, 48 Bills are promised and due, many of which are mentioned, on a daily basis, on the Order of Business over a wide range of issues, from the covert surveillance Bill to the criminal justice (cybercrime) Bill to the ratification of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime Bill.  I ask that, between now and next week, in conjunction with the Whip's office, a priority list be ordered so we can know in advance which of the 48 Bills are priority Bills and which of those priority Bills will be taken before the summer recess.  I also ask the Taoiseach to guarantee, in the context of justice legislation, that in June, when we are nearing the summer recess, adequate time will be given to the debates and there will not be guillotine motions on a daily basis.  Given the importance of all the legislation and the fact the House must give careful scrutiny to all of it, I ask for a priority list.

This is something the Government could tackle fairly quickly by bringing forward the aforementioned Bill before the summer recess.

There are also two conventions about which I have asked before.  One is the UN Convention on Disability and I ask the Taoiseach to indicate whether that it will be ratified by Ireland in the coming year.  The second is the UN Convention against Corruption which was promised in the Government's White Paper on development and in the programme for Government but shows little likelihood of being passed.  I ask about that convention regularly.  I ask about the housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill because of the urgency of the discussion regarding social housing and the two UN conventions, one on disability, which is urgent and is being actively sought by the Disability Federation and the other on corruption.

A major contribution to that convention was made by Professor Gerard Quinn, who was on the drafting committee.  It is a convention associated with Ireland and it reflects very badly on us that it has not been incorporated into law here.  The Taoiseach, who has an interest in disability, knows that the Federation on Disability and others are very anxious that legislation concerning the protection of the rights of the disabled be given priority.It really is not good enough because at this stage, all these conventions are queueing up in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It makes a nonsense of the people who work so hard in this area, like Professor Quinn who has worked for years on bringing this convention into being.

Much of the multiannual investment has been allocated quite rightly to that area and I hope that will continue.The mental capacity Bill, which deals with some of the issues that are perhaps also covered by that convention, is due later this year.  Various items of legislation are sometimes brought forward to adapt various parts of a convention rather than having an omnibus enactment which, while ratifying conventions, in terms of the wide application and interpretation of them may well be such as to be beyond the policy positions of Governments at any given time.Our commitment in this area is well worth recognising.  We have been working hard in the disability area.  The mental capacity Bill deals with another aspect of disability.  As I said, it is due later this year.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	210	The Constituency Commission presented its Report on Dáil and European Parliament Constituencies 2007 to the Ceann Comhairle on 23 October 2007.At the outset, it might be helpful for the House if I outline the principal constitutional and other legal requirements relating to the revision of Dail constituencies. Article 16° of the Constitution provides: "The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country."This provision was considered by the courts in two cases in 1961, the High Court case of John O'Donovan versus the Attorney General and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1961.  It was again considered in a High Court case last year taken by Deputies Finian McGrath and the former Deputy Catherine Murphy where it was argued that the constituencies on which the general election was being fought did not comply with the constitutional requirement contained in that article.  In none of these cases did the courts quantify the precise degree of equality of representation that is required by the Constitution.In his judgment in June 2007, Mr. Justice Clarke emphasised the urgent obligation on the Oireachtas under the Constitution to revise constituencies in circumstances such as those we now have.  For example, at paragraph 4.23, he stated that where census figures show that current constituencies are no longer proportional, "....the Oireachtas has an immediate and pressing obligation to put in place measures designed to remedy that problem by enacting appropriate amending legislation".  At paragraph 8.1 of the judgment, he stated: "...the obligation to review constituencies is one which places an urgent burden on the Oireachtas.  This burden is all the more so when constituencies can be demonstrated to have as high a degree of lack of proportionality as was undoubtedly demonstrated to be the case on the facts of this case."Examples of significant disparities in terms of population to seat ratio based on Census 2006 include 21.24% above the national average in Dublin West; 17.76% above the national average in Dublin North; 13.79% above the national average in Meath East; and 10.6% below the national average in Dun Laoghaire.  These constituencies are still in place.Article 16.2.4° of the Constitution provides that: "The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, . . ."  This, in effect, requires that the constituencies be revised whenever population changes shown in a census lead to populations per Deputy in individual constituencies that are significantly out of line with national average representation.  Mr. Justice Clarke's judgment, as I said, emphasises that there is an urgent obligation on the Oireachtas to revise constituencies as soon as it becomes clear from a census that the existing constituencies no longer have the level of proportionality that the Constitution requires.Section 5 of the Electoral Act 1997 provides that, on publication of the relevant CSO report on a census, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must set up a commission to report on Dáil and European constituencies.  The terms of reference of the commission are specified in the Act, which are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions.For over half a century after the founding of the State, changes in constituencies were formulated and advanced by the Government of the day.  The first constituency commission was set up in 1977 to report on constituencies for the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979.  The first Dáil constituency commission was established in 1980 on a non-statutory basis and such non-statutory commissions continued to report on the constituency revisions until the enactment of the Electoral Act 1997.  The commission that reported in October 2007 is the third statutory commission established under the Act.  It is the long-established practice for the Oireachtas to enact, in full, constituency revisions recommended by the independent commissions created for this purpose over the last 30 years.Under the 1997 Act, a constituency commission was established on 26 April 2007, chaired by the honourable Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill, a judge of the High Court.  The other members of the Commission were Mr. Kieran Coughlan, Clerk of the Dáil; Ms. Deirdre Lane, Clerk of the Seanad; Ms. Geraldine Tallon, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and Ms. Emily O'Reilly, the Ombudsman.Section 6 of the 1997 Act provides that a constituency commission shall, in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution, have regard to the following: the total number of members of the Dáil shall be not fewer than 164 and not more than 168; each constituency shall return three, four or five Members; the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable; each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas; there shall be regard to geographic considerations, including significant physical features and the extent and density of population in each constituency; and, subject to these provisions, the commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity with regard to the arrangement of constituencies.The commission's report recommends that total Dáil membership should remain at 166, in 43 constituencies, the same number as at present.  A total of 19 of the proposed constituencies are identical in name, area and level of representation to an existing constituency.  A further 18 retain the name and level of representation of an existing constituency, but differ from it to varying degrees in area.  Many of these changes are small and involve a relatively minor reallocation of population, for example, from the Cork East, Cork North-West, Donegal North-East, Kildare South and Laois-Offaly constituencies.  Therefore, many parts of the country are not affected, or are not affected significantly, by the commission's recommendations.Inevitably, however, given the constitutional requirements as regards equality of representation, there are significant changes in some areas where the 2006 census indicated notable population growth or decline compared to the national average.  An increase of one seat is proposed in both the Louth and Dublin West constituencies, together with changes in the areas covered by the constituencies.  A reduction of one seat is proposed in both Dún Laoghaire and Limerick East, with the latter to be renamed as Limerick City.  Changes in the areas covered by these constituencies are also provided for.  It is proposed that the area and name of two constituencies should change and that Kerry North and Limerick West should be amended to Kerry North-West Limerick and Limerick, respectively.The commission's terms of reference include the avoidance of breaches of county boundaries as far as practicable.  Commission recommendations have at times been criticised for not keeping to these boundaries.  The current report involves three new breaches of county boundaries, in Kerry-Limerick, Louth-Meath and Offaly-Tipperary.  While attachment to county boundaries is understandable, the terms of reference of commissions are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions, which do not refer to counties.In the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Budd in the O'Donovan case, it was stated:. . . although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties.  The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.There is no absolute prohibition on the breach of county boundaries.  Indeed, the experience has been that at times the constitutional provisions require such action.On European Parliament constituencies, the commission recommends, in a context of 12 representatives from Ireland in the Parliament, a reduction of a seat in the Dublin constituency and the transfer of the population of counties Longford and Westmeath from the east to the north-west constituency.We can all recognise that it might have been possible for the commission to suggest solutions other than those recommended in the report.  However, the commission's independent determination of the issues, taking account of submissions made, should be respected.  By cherry-picking individual recommendations, we would undermine the reasons for establishing an independent commission in the first place.  It is my firm view that the precedent of adhering to the commission's advice should not be broken.Deputies from all sides will undoubtedly have views on specific recommendations.  While some views may be quite positive, it is probably human nature that those who are not happy with the report will contribute more to discussion on it than those who are content with it.  I have no doubt that there will be cross-party concerns about recommendations affecting particular local areas.  I fully acknowledge and respect such concerns, which reflect the inevitably significant impact of the relevant constitutional requirements on areas with population trends which diverge from the national average.  They are also, in terms of their cross-party nature, a mark of the independence of the commission in carrying out its work.  In this regard, it should be noted that the commission gives careful and considered reasons in its report for the recommendations it makes.Consistent with past practice and taking account of the urgent need for the Oireachtas to legislate in accordance with the commission's report, the Government approved the drafting of the necessary Bill to give effect to the commission's report at its meeting on 30 January 2008.  Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and my Department and the Attorney General's Office are working to ensure that the Bill will be published as soon as possible.The Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 will also provide for future commissions to be established on publication by the CSO of the preliminary figures in respect of a census and for the work of a commission to be finalised after publication by the CSO of the final census figures.  The Bill will bring nomination procedures for non-party candidates at European Parliament and local elections into line with those enacted for Dáil elections in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2007.I look forward to the contributions of Deputies on this important issue.  However, I must stress again the need for action.  There is, in the words of Mr. Justice Clarke in paragraph 8 of his judgment, "an urgent constitutional imperative on the Oireachtas to deal with any disparity as a matter of urgency".  The Bill I propose to bring before the House shortly to implement the commission's report will do that.

The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stand accused of acting illegally in respect of the electoral boundaries.  At least, it can be shown that there has been an unjustifiable delay in giving effect to the recommendations to the constituency commission, given that it was approved for drafting by Government on 30 January 2008.  It is clear that because of these delays the Oireachtas, or more appropriately the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who has responsibility in this area, is in breach of constitutional law and is open to challenge.The Government has ignored the report of the Electoral Boundary Commission and deliberately delayed its implementation, in spite of a High Court judgment in 2007 whereby Judge Frank Clark stated that the Government would be obliged to implement the recommendations of the commission with minimum delay.  I know things happen slowly around here, but——

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The definition of a minimum delay seems to depend on who one is.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach have ignored the commission, statute law, the Constitution and the clear direction of the courts with regard to the implementation of the report of the Electoral Boundary Commission with minimum delay.  The Green Party seems to be happy to sit idly by and watch this happen under the watchful gaze of one of its own.I was bemused recently when the Taoiseach, then Tánaiste, was expansive on the Order of Business about Members here having a second bite of the cherry with regard to the report of the Electoral Boundary Commission.  However, I was less bemused when I looked into what he was proposing.  When he said that Members should have an opportunity to give their views and send them back to the commission — to do what, he did not say — that could, if one was an undying optimist, be regarded as Fianna Fáil finally accepting the primacy of the Dáil.  In the same week that he proposed this new review role for the Dáil in respect of the boundary commission, the Dáil was told by the outgoing Taoiseach when commenting on tribunals that there was a different or better way to deal with things.  The former Taoiseach told the Dáil that a better way of dealing with investigations into ethical wrongdoing or corruption by Members through tribunals was by a committee of the House.  This road to Damascus conversion is a bit rich from a party which has been in power for the past 11 years and has sat on meaningful reform of the Dáil.  The one exception — Leaders' Questions — came from the then Ceann Comhairle rather than resulting from openness on the part of Fianna Fáil.The Taoiseach has received plaudits for his eulogy at the late Patrick Hillery's funeral on what was interpreted by some in the media as affirming a departure from the dark Haughey era.  However, on Question Time he proposed to review the report of the Constituency Commission, placing himself slap bang in the middle of that same era.Constituency revisions, before the onset of the Constituency Commission in 1980, had a chequered history.  Since Jack Lynch, a noble predecessor of the Taoiseach, established the commission in 1980, all its reports have been enacted into law by both Houses without amendment.  The one exception was in 1988 when the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, tried to rig the terms of reference by excluding the creation of five-seat constituencies, save only in exceptional circumstances.  In 1988 the commission was not on a statutory footing so Charles J. Haughey, as he would, and the then Minister for the Environment responsible, the redoubtable Padraig Flynn, who had other things on his mind as well, probably felt the commission was fair game for a bit of muzzling.  The report of that commission was never enacted or even initiated as a Bill as Charles J. Haughey led a minority Government.  That was the only occasion in its 28 years when a commission's report was not enacted.The situation is very different now that the Government has a comfortable majority.  One can only imagine what kind of stricture we would have were it not for the fact that the Minister stated today that he accepts the independence of the commission without reservation.  I welcome that.Under the Electoral Act 1997, the commission is a statutory independent body so the bar is raised even higher.  Yet the Taoiseach, in a contribution to the Dáil some weeks ago, proposed to set aside the commission's report and the law of the land.  He cast doubt on the validity of the current report.  He engaged in a breach of trust with the membership of the commission, which does an excellent job.  It is in place to ensure the integrity of the electoral boundary process, which is important in our democracy.  The Taoiseach informed some of his electorate in south Offaly that he would sort their problem out and ensure they were not moved into the Tipperary electoral area.The Taoiseach stated that Members have the right to change the recommendations of the commission's report.  While technically correct, that can only be when the recommendations are before this House as a Bill.  Today's format of statements is a meaningless exercise.  In any event an electoral Bill has never been amended.  If we were to follow the Taoiseach's confused thinking on this subject, Members, as legislators, would be given the opportunity to change reports from the numerous commissions and so on, for example, on the health services.Why should the Constituency Commission's reports be treated differently?  Constituency boundary changes do not suit all parties at various times.  What is gained in the roundabouts is lost in the swings.  That is the price to pay to allow the independent commission, headed by a High Court judge, to get on with its job, which is thankless at the best of times but is a very important one in protecting our parliamentary democracy and the integrity of our electoral process.  I do not want us to go back to the bad old days of the 1960s and 1970s when parties and Governments did not adhere to the proper and appropriate ways in which constituency reviews could avoid the charge of gerrymander.I hope the Taoiseach sees the errors of his ways, learns his lesson and backs off with this reckless proposal.  If this is his line of thinking about what he can do with constituency boundaries, it does not augur well for his tenure as Taoiseach.  We do not want to go back to the dark days of the Haughey era with the manipulation of our electoral process.It was a Fianna Fáil-Ied Government that implemented the Electoral Act 1997.  If there is a problem, why not introduce primary legislation to amend it?  It is classic Fianna Fáil practice — speaking out of both sides of the mouth at the same time.  It is only by proposals from the Government regarding the terms of reference, now legally enshrined in the Electoral Act, that anomalies arise, such as in the case of Leitrim, south Offaly and Dublin North and Carlow-Kilkenny.  In the last review, Carlow-Kilkenny, for which I am Member, had to put up with the swings and roundabouts.  I did not have much support from Government figures, including the Taoiseach, to address that anomaly.  People accepted that one had to be within the constitutional limits for constituency size and they got on with business.Instead of today's statements, we should be dealing with legislation to implement the latest report's recommendations.  I am surprised the Minister has not taken the opportunity to introduce a Bill rather than having these meaningless statements.Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 provided for the establishment of a Constituency Commission upon publication by the Central Statistics Office of the census report setting out the population of the State by area.  The Constituency Commission reports on the constituencies for the election of Members to the Dáil and the election of representatives to the European Parliament.  The review does not apply to local electoral areas.  Section 9(4) states: "As soon as may be after the establishment of a Constituency Commission, and, in any event, not later than six months after such establishment, the Commission shall present to the Chairman of the Dáil".There is a significant dispute between the parties as to the proper interpretation of a "census" as that term is used in Article 16.2.3° of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  That dispute is brought into stark relief by a consideration of the timing of certain important events.  The census was conducted in April 2006.  On 19 July 2006 the Central Statistics Office published a so-called "preliminary report".  On 29 March 2007, the Central Statistics Office published what was called the principal demographic results.In a case brought before the last general election by the former Member, Catherine Murphy, and Deputy Finian McGrath, interpretation of these terms was adjudicated on by Mr. Justice Clarke.  He stated it would be in order for preliminary results from a census to be taken into account when establishing a Constituency Commission but the recommendations of the commission cannot be finalised until the final census figures are compiled.  The Oireachtas has chosen to enact the 1997 Act which provides, in Part II, for the establishment of a Constituency Commission and the reporting by that commission to the Chairman of the Dáil within a specified period.Given the urgent nature of the obligation on the Oireachtas to ensure that the period between the publication of a new census disclosing a population disparity in the constituencies and the enactment of new constituencies to deal with that disparity, it seems that the Oireachtas would have to give urgent consideration to whether it would be appropriate to amend the 1997 Act to enable the processes set out in that Act to commence after the publication of a preliminary report.  It gives the option to the Minister, which he has indicated he will enshrine in law, to intervene with regard to the preliminary figures.The judge was quite forceful in his judgment:However it seems to me to be clear that if, without justifiable reason, the Oireachtas did not take appropriate steps to ensure the minimum delay between the finalisation of the ascertainment of the population in a census and the determination and enactment of a law providing for new constituencies, then it might be appropriate for the court to take further action.It would seem the Minister is open to challenge because he has not observed the court judgment.  If any Member wished to take that challenge it would go back to the High Court and the Minister would be forced to act.  Six months later is not in my view the definition of "minimum delay".This has been a meaningless exercise.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has now informed the House that he is implementing the electoral boundary commission's report in full and this is to be welcomed.  He is not engaging in the charade that has been suggested to him by the Taoiseach in revising boundaries in order to suit certain individuals.  The electoral boundary commission is set up for one purpose, to look after the boundaries according to the Constitution and to ensure that the people are sovereign in these matters and that nothing is done as a means of suiting the particular individual interests of any Member of the House.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The Labour Party fully supports the principle that decisions in regard to constituency boundaries should be made by an independent commission.  It was my party colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who introduced the Electoral Act 1997, which provided for this.  The Government and Oireachtas should accept the final report of the commission and enact legislation providing for the changes recommended.I have full confidence in the independence and integrity of the members who make up the commission.  However, they are no more infallible than the rest of us, as it seems, unfortunately, some of the recommendations made in the most recent report would seem to indicate.  We are not privy to how the commission reaches its conclusions as it quite properly conducts its business in private.  The current procedure is that the commission is established by the Minister; it is given its terms of reference, based on the provisions of section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997; and it then invites submissions from the public and interested groups and in due course issues its final report.Reviewing the way in which the current system is scheduled I believe the law should be changed to allow for a two-stage process prior to the finalisation of the report.  This could be done by the commission, having considered initial submissions, publishing a draft report and inviting further submissions from the public and interested parties.  This would at least allow people who believe that a particular recommendation is illogical, irrational or inconsistent with the commission's own terms of reference, to make that point.  The commission would be required to consider such submissions but, of course, would be under no obligation to act on them.  The final report would then be accepted by the Government and Oireachtas and its recommendations implemented.  Such an approach would greatly add to the quality of the commission's work and would greatly improve both the consultation process and inform the recommendations of the final report.In my view the Oireachtas should act on the suggestion made by Mr. Justice Frank Clarke of the High Court in his judgment last August that urgent consideration should be given to amending the Electoral Act to allow the constituency reviewing process to begin from the time of publication of the preliminary rather than the final census figures.  In his judgment Mr. Justice Clarke accepted that the current constituency boundaries, on which last year's election was fought, were seriously out of line.  The Oireachtas should now take the opportunity presented by Mr. Justice Clarke's comments to ensure that the people are never again asked to go the polls on outdated constituency boundaries.  Furthermore, it is clear there is no longer any need to await final census figures to ensure that accurate data is available to allow a Constituency Commission to redraw boundaries.  With the sophisticated information-gathering systems now available to the CSO, it has been clear for several decades that the differences between preliminary and final population figures are insignificant.  There is therefore no reason the constituency review process cannot begin when the preliminary figures are published, which is generally about 12 months before the final figures become available.There is no doubt that had the constituency boundaries been reviewed in advance of the recent election to reflect the changes in population experienced since 2002, then the outcome in a number of constituencies would have been different.  Whether these would have been sufficient to alter the overall outcome of the election and the configuration of the present Government, is anyone's guess but it is a question that needs to be asked.The terms of reference for the commission set out in the 1997 Act should be amended to protect our system of proportional representation and this should be a key term of reference for the work of the commission.  Given the position of the stipulated voting system within the Constitution, this is not a point of debate but rather a constitutional requirement.  In practical terms this means that if there are two or more possible configurations for constituencies in a particular locality, with due regard being had to all relevant factors, then the commission's leaning should be for the one that provides for a smaller number of constituencies returning a greater number of members rather than for a multiplicity of three-seat constituencies.  It is therefore unnecessary to set out the basic maths which goes to show that the purpose of a proportional representation-single transferable vote election is most successfully achieved in constituencies which return more Members.In a submission made last year, the Labour Party argued that a fundamental requirement for the commission was to protect the element of proportionality to ensure the closest possible correlation between the share of the votes a party gets and the number of seats it secures.  Statistics provided to the commission by the Labour Party clearly demonstrate that larger constituencies provide the greater degree of proportionality.  Unfortunately the commission took little account of this, leaving the proportion of three, four and five seat constituencies largely the same.  More than one third of all constituencies are now three-seaters, the configuration that produces the least proportional outcome.  For example, because the Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned, Kerry South will actually become a two-seater, which comes close to rendering the constitutional right of the people of Kerry South to proportional representation null and void.The people of Ireland have voted in referenda on two occasions to retain proportional representation.  We should ensure that the value of this system is not undermined by inadequate terms of reference given to the commission.  I would suggest that the 1997 Act be amended by the insertion of the following new paragraph in the commission's terms of reference:The Commission shall, so far as practicable, recommend such arrangements in relation to the constituencies as are best calculated to result in an outcome where the number of members of each qualifying party elected to Dáil Éireann, as a proportion of the total number of members of the Dáil belonging to qualified parties, is the same proportion as the total number of first preference votes obtained by the candidates of each such qualifying party at the general election bears to the total number of first preference votes obtained by candidates of all qualifying parties at that election.The terms of reference could also be changed to allow for the creation of six-seaters, where appropriate, which are more favourable than two three-seat constituencies side by side.  These changes would result in a more open and transparent system for reviewing the constituencies, while preserving the principle of an independent process.  It would provide results in which the public would have greater confidence and provide a bulwark against the further erosion of our system of proportional representation.The commission should be looked at in the overall context of institutional reform, leading to a broadening of our democracy which would result in some of the most significant changes to the manner in which in which elections are organised and conducted in the State.To achieve this goal I intend to bring before the House an electoral commission Bill which would establish a new electoral and public offices commission that would take over the powers of the existing Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referendum and Constituency Commissions.  The new body would also take over from local authorities the responsibility for the electoral register and from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the responsibility for the running of elections.  This Bill would provide for major changes in the process by which the constituencies are revised.  In redrawing the constituencies, the commission will be required so far as practicable, to recommend an arrangement of constituency sizes and boundaries that is best calculated to produce an overall proportionate result.  To achieve this result, we will be able to recommend constituencies returning three, four, five or six Members.  The bar currently stands at five-seat constituencies.  The commission would also be able to commence work on redrawing constituencies based on the preliminary census figures, rather than having to wait for the final report, which is the situation at present.  The commission would then produce a preliminary or draft report, which has not been done in this case where the commission has arrived at its findings and we are debating them.  That situation should be reversed so that a consultation and information process can be put in place first.  In that way, we would not be debating something after the stable door has been closed.  Having considered the submissions, the commission would then produce a final report when the final census figures are available.The publication of a preliminary or draft report would address one of the major shortcomings of the current system — that once the commission produces its report, there is no way of asking it to the review the decision, no matter how illogical, irrational or inconsistent it may have been with its own terms of reference.  Some the recommendations made in the most recent report, such as the effective dismemberment of County Limerick and the transfer to 14,000 voters to the Kerry North constituency, would fall into this category.The other major area of reform concerns the compilation of the electoral register.  Despite some belated efforts made prior to the last general election to update the register, anyone involved in active politics will be aware just how inaccurate the register remains.The Bill I am promoting on behalf of the Labour Party also proposes to transfer to the Constituency Commission the functions of local authorities in preparing and publishing the register of electors.  The commission must seek to achieve the comprehensive, accurate and timely registration of persons entitled to be registered as electors in an efficient and economical manner.  It also proposes to entitle the commission to information from statutory bodies and utilities, so as to record accurately the names and addresses of electors.  The Bill allows for the use of people's public service identity in order to establish their true name and address.  A public service identity consists of a person's PPS number, name, date and place of birth, sex, address and nationality.The electoral process is the cornerstone of our democratic system.  It is essential that the public should have full confidence in the reliability of the electoral register and the way in which constituency boundaries are determined.  We must examine both these matters together, including how elections are run in terms of structures and systems.  In addition, we need to have a commission with powers governing all these areas, which would deliver a more open and transparent system for reviewing constituencies while protecting the principle of an independent process.A new type of commission is required that would provide for the assurance of an electoral register and an electoral system in which the public could have greater confidence, and which would also provide a bulwark against any erosion of confidence in our democratic system.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue but I regret that we will not be having a vote on it.  We could be doing something more important, which I will allude to later on.  I am delighted that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is present.I sincerely hope that the Constituency Commission and the Minister will reflect strongly on what Deputies say here today.  I also hope they will urgently reconsider the outcome of the commission's report.  I have been straight with my opinion on the findings contained in the Constituency Commission's report.  In short, I believe many of its recommendations to be ludicrous.  I am not casting aspersions on the Constituency Commission itself.  I recognise its members are all very eminent and honourable people.  I am aware that they have no agenda in putting forward this report but I do not believe that they, or anybody this House, are infallible, as other speakers have said.Some of the report's recommendations have been short-sighted.  Let us look briefly at some of the areas which are going to be radically altered in the commission's new plan.  Aside from my own constituency of Dublin North, many other areas are also affected such as Limerick West, which is to be incorporated into north Kerry, while parts of Meath East will move into the Louth constituency and parts of south Offaly into Tipperary North.  In addition, Leitrim remains divided into two Dáil constituencies.  There is a blatant ignorance of contiguous boundaries, especially in Offaly where the new constituency not only breaks geographical and county boundaries, but also provincial borders.These proposals make no sense for many Deputies, especially my colleagues in Dublin North.  I am referring specifically to the recommendation to transfer a large proportion of the town of Swords from the Dublin North constituency to that of Dublin West, some 11 kilometres to the west of Swords.Swords is the largest town in north County Dublin and is the tenth largest town in the country.  It is larger than Navan, Kilkenny or Sligo, all of which have their own urban district councils or town councils, which to date Swords does not have.  Swords has a population of over 33,000 people and is a large sprawling town primarily comprising housing estates and a village centre.  It is isolated from other areas as it is prevented from joining Santry and Ballymun because of its proximity to Dublin airport.  It is also prevented from reaching as far as Malahide by virtue of the M1 motorway, and from Blanchardstown because of the miles of agricultural hinterland in between.It is by far the most identifiable stand-alone town in the north Dublin region.  Ideologically, the people of Swords very much identify themselves as north County Dubliners.  They have issues that are specific to the north county region.  In addition, they align themselves more with other towns in the area, such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Donabate, Rush, Lusk, Malahide and Portmarnock, rather than with the west Dublin areas of Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and Castleknock.  Simply to draw a line down Swords' main street and decide that everyone to the west of that line should now vote in a different constituency, Dublin West, 11 kilometres away, is at best short-sighted and at worst plainly inconsiderate — I mean inconsiderate in the most basic sense, as outlined in a report prepared by the Swords electoral boundary action group.The independent Constituency Commission has not properly considered the issue of under-representation in Dublin North and Dublin West, or how best to deal with it.  Both constituencies are significantly under represented in the Dáil.  It is ludicrous to remove 13,000 people and relocate them on the Dublin West electoral register in order to support it as a four-seater constituency.Ireland has experienced a major population boom which no one could have anticipated.  My constituency of Dublin North has over 20% more citizens per Deputy than a more balanced constituency which has 30,000 people per Member.  This is the issue at the heart of these proposals — to readdress the balance across the country's constituencies.  Both Dublin North and Dublin West have too few Dáil representatives.  The easy answer, which the commission recommends, is to remove a section of the population from Dublin North and add it to Dublin West, thus making Dublin West a four-seater constituency.  As a result, the commission argues, the remaining population in Dublin North would be more appropriate to its current level of representation.  This answer is simple and effective, no doubt, and in theory it works very well.  However, my dispute is not with the method but with the result.There are other areas contiguous to Dublin West, but why were they not considered?  Why not consider the next census, which will undoubtedly see an increase in Dublin West's population and in Dublin North's, allowing it to be considered as an automatic four-seater constituency?  This point has clearly not been taken into account.What will happen in 2012 or 2017 when the Constituency Commission realises that Dublin West's population has boomed again and has the added burden of over 13,000 people from Swords still based in the constituency?  The logical plan at that point would be to redraw the boundary lines again and reunify Swords in the Dublin North constituency.  This makes the current exercise seem entirely pointless, not to mention the confusion and disenfranchisement felt by the people of Swords who will have spent at least two election campaigns wondering not who to vote for, but who they have the right to vote for.Given Fingal County Council's new population projection for Swords, which will see its population reaching 100,000 with the advent of the metro rail system, the area will be operating as a city within ten to 15 years.Dublin North will most likely merit a five-seat constituency and the commission does not appear to have taken that into account.  Simply put, the proposal by the Constituency Commission to split the primary town of Fingal, in other words Swords, into two electoral areas is ridiculous.  I understand the justification for the proposal.  No doubt the issue can be explained away with mention of the constitutional requirement to restore balance to the constituencies.  Constitutionally, every 30,000 residents are entitled to one TD in the Dáil.  At present this ratio is not satisfied in Dublin North or Dublin West and the Constituency Commission has shown its willingness to ignore contiguous areas in its willingness to redress the balance.  I pointed out the geographical location of Swords and how it is identified as a stand-alone area.The Electoral Act 1997, the same Act which established the Constituency Commission, states that each constituency "shall be composed of contiguous areas" and "there shall be regard for geographical considerations, including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency".  This means that the Constituency Commission is legally obliged to have regard to natural geographically boundaries and the recommendation to split Swords certainly does not run in tandem with that.The commission has been at pains to point out its motivation for moving a proportion of Swords into Dublin West.  This comes back to the issue of redressing boundaries.  The commission will argue that the constitutional obligation to provide a balanced constituency far outweighs the legal ramifications of not obeying geographical boundaries, but I would argue that it is wrong, given that the answer to this quandary is found in the commission's report:In weighing up the issue of equality of representation versus adherence to natural townland boundaries, the Supreme Court took the following action, as detailed in the Constituency Commission's report, namely, it deferred to TDs and local representatives to identify the problems arising out of the redrawing of boundaries.  In the section of the report relating to equality of representation, the commission's report quotes the Supreme Court judgment on the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1961.  It states: "The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this court cannot have."  The removal of 13,000 voters from Swords to Dublin West does not make sense given that we speak about splitting county boundaries, but splitting town boundaries is absolutely crazy.Following the ending of this debate I would like the issue to be referred back to the Constituency Commission to reconsider not only my area but all the other areas because I do not believe we should automatically accept its report.  Everything we do in this Chamber is debated and voted on.  I am not casting aspersions on the members of the commission — they are honourable people — but in this instance I believe they have got it wrong.  We should all be big enough to say, let us go back and look at it.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter and confess to a certain amount of puzzlement, in line with that experienced by the King of Siam, on different issues in relation to the Taoiseach's position vis-à-vis the Constituency Commission.  Does Government common sense, if that is not a contradiction in terms, cross over from the role of Tánaiste to that of Taoiseach?  Perhaps that should be rephrased to ask when is common sense not common sense but rather expediency.  In April 2008, the then Tánaiste said that TDs should have a greater say in the creation of the electoral map, to have the right to change recommendations made by the electoral commission and to revise constituency boundaries.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, said that TDs were simply presented with a firm decision or an irreversible fact and did not have an input into what was happening.  That was when he issued the immortal words and demanded more common sense solutions.The ball is in the Taoiseach's court.  He has the power to put his money where his mouth is and allow, as he said in April, "this sovereign Parliament" to take upon itself responsibilities in this area and devise a consensus around modifications on behalf of constituents who are dissatisfied.  Does he really want to do this and bring the wrath of the electorate and their representatives on his head and open this House to charges of duplicity?  There is, of course, a problem with his proposed course of action.  As my colleagues, Deputies O'Dowd and Hogan, said in this House, the independent Constituency Commission was chaired by a High Court judge and all TDs had an opportunity to make their submissions known to it before it reached its conclusions.  With any suspicion of gerrymandering hanging over the establishment of an all-party committee, as suggested by the Taoiseach, which by its nature would have a greater number of Government members than Opposition members, could this House retain its sovereign status, in anything but the most dubious way?Could the Taoiseach's remarks have anything to do with the pressure brought to bear by Leitrim Fianna Fáil backbench TDs and councillors last year when they threatened to resign if the Oireachtas approved the recommendations of the Constituency Commission?  Conveniently, the Taoiseach's contention that the Dáil had the power to stop the county boundaries being breached would bring the possibility of County Leitrim being reunited a step closer.Since the 1980s the recommendations of the independent commission have been accepted by the Oireachtas without amendment.  Chaired by a High Court judge and comprising the clerks of the Dáil and Seanad as well as the Ombudsman and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in whom I have the utmost confidence, it is very much an independent process.  Where changes have been made as in Louth-Meath, Dublin West, Dublin North, Dublin South-Dún Laoghaire and Limerick-Kerry a coherent and reasonable explanation has been given by the commission for its decisions.  Dublin West and Louth will gain a seat while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Limerick East will lose one.  Limerick has lost enough under this Government to date, including the Aer Lingus routes.  The Government has practically denuded the entire west of other services.  As highlighted, Leitrim remains divided.Rather than attempting to overrule the commission, the Taoiseach and his Government would be better served by bringing forward legislation to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission given that the local elections are due to take place next year.  We do not want a repeat of the fiasco with the electoral register that threatened the validity of the general election and the core of our democracy.Prior to the general election last year, I highlighted the puzzling number of people whose names had been taken off the electoral register.  We also saw that in some cases the numbers, taken from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's statistics, on the draft register strangely and suspiciously exceeded the adult population in some areas, particularly along the Border regions.  The total number of errors in the register was reckoned to reach 300,000.The adult population of Longford is 24,810, yet the draft register contained 27,132 names, a difference of 2,322, or 9%, and Westmeath which has an adult population of 57,141 had 59,791 names on the draft register, a difference of 2,650, or 5%.Historically, the constituency of Longford-Westmeath goes back to the foundation of the State and the Government of Ireland Act 1920, with a redrawing of the boundaries for 2002-07, and three elections prior to that, when it was redesignated Longford-Roscommon.  An injustice remains, however, with several areas of County Westmeath — Clonmellon, Delvin, Fore, Ratharney, Bracklyn, Whitehall and the Castlepollard area — remaining outside the Longford-Westmeath constituency.  There is also a question as to the reason the constituency has not been designated five seats.In 2002, I made a submission to the Constituency Commission in support of the restoration of the Longford-Westmeath constituency, citing the facts that the population of the area is ideal for a Dáil constituency and that it was the historical constituency for the area.  While both constituencies — Longford-Westmeath and Longford-Roscommon — do not breach county boundaries, the latter was an unrealistic constituency as the two counties are in separate provinces.  The River Shannon was disregarded by the commission despite its terms of reference and the fact that just two bridges connect counties Longford and Roscommon, which have fewer land connections than England and France.  The commission, in its wisdom, restored the previous status quo.Just two years after redrawing the constituencies, the Constituency Commission chaired by Mr. Justice O'Neill has recommended that 24 out of 43 constituencies be reshaped and proposed small adjustments to the distribution of Dáil Deputies.  The commission has proposed the creation of 24 new constituencies, with nine carried over from the 2005 Electoral Act and the remaining ten dating from an earlier period.  Overall the commission adopted a minimalist approach in its recommendations.  While the number of five seat and three seat constituencies fell by one in each case, the impact of the measure was neutralised by an increase in the number of four seat constituencies.  The number of Deputies and constituencies remained unchanged at 166 and 43, respectively.The immediate test of the commission is to conclude its ongoing deliberations on the boundaries for next year's local elections.  The knock-on effect of population transfers arising from the decisions pending will be keenly watched by Deputies and prospective Deputies alike.  Many potential candidates for the Dáil are rising through the ranks of local government.  There has been condemnation in some quarters that the commission clung too closely to the existing model or that it has perhaps been too radical in those areas in which it opted to take a radical approach.  Let us not forget, however, that unlike politicians from the Taoiseach down, the commission has no axe to grind and no fences to mend.I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, on standing up to the former Taoiseach when he issued a statement on this issue in April last.  Long may the cross-party support for the independence of the Constituency Commission continue.

Since the independent Constituency Commission was first established in the late 1970s, the decisions of successive commissions have been accepted in full for Dáil, European and local authority elections.  The independence of the Constituency Commission must be maintained.Many speakers have referred to changes to electoral boundaries.  One can always argue, irrespective of the changes or decisions made, that more appropriate boundaries are available.  However, we must work within certain parameters and accept the recommendations of the Constituency Commission.On a wider issue, the accuracy or otherwise of the electoral register has been discussed many times in committee and the House.  It is vital for the maintenance of the integrity of the electoral process to make serious efforts to ensure the register is up to date.  The census is the basis on which the Constituency Commission performs its function and census information must be used to ensure the electoral register is accurate.The boundaries of my constituency of Cork North-West and other constituencies in the county have changed significantly over the years.  Experts, including those working in the community and voluntary sector, have attended political meetings to express an opinion on which areas should and should not be included in various constituencies.  The difficulty in these circumstances is deciding where to draw the line.  My constituency spans the full spectrum of Irish life.  It has a large urban area as well as a remote, rural hinterland and will soon include Ballincollig, a large satellite town of Cork city.  In addition to the commuter belt, it includes villages and towns such as Rockchapel and Charleville and rural areas extending almost as far as Dunmanway.  It includes both rich agricultural land and more marginal land.  While some will argue that constituencies should be either rural or urban in character, my constituency, with its urban and rural mix, mirrors Irish life much more accurately than purely urban constituencies.I note Deputy Ciarán Lynch has joined the debate.

#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	219	He was not here when I rose to speak.  The parish of Kilshannig has moved into the Deputy's constituency.  It is strange that the urban constituency of Cork North-Central is being extended almost as far as Mallow, to within eight or ten miles of Kanturk and into east Cork.  While I am aware that population factors were an issue for the constituency, nevertheless, a predominately urban constituency is extending into rural areas.  As a result, it may more accurately reflect the make-up of society.While we can discuss the decisions of the Constituency Commission, Deputies must not charge that certain of its decisions were politically motivated as to do so would bring us back to square one.  The commission is appointed to report to the Ceann Comhairle within a specified timeframe.  Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, a judge of the High Court, was appointed chairman of the most recent Constituency Commission.  While Deputies may have difficulties with its recommendations, we must accept its independence.I note the criticism that changes to the boundaries of Limerick constituencies ignore county boundaries.  While the terms of reference of the Constituency Commission included that it should in as far as possible observe county boundaries, the difficulty is that substantial growth in the population of urban areas means boundaries must be redrawn if the number of Dáil Deputies is to be retained at the current figure of 166.  Some people have said the figure of one TD per 30,000 is the ultimate aim.  Irrespective of the decisions that have been made, the most important thing is that our commission and the Oireachtas continue to involve people in the democratic process and that this issue is given due recognition.  Serving the people in a democratic system is a noble calling.  It is important to uphold the independence of boundary commissions and that the profession of politics is held in good stead right across the country.Greater recognition should be given to the volunteers of our organisations.  They are the real political people on the ground and they are active in community groups and so on.  People are time poor when it comes to volunteering, so we should acknowledge the contributions made by those who get involved in political parties across the country.It is important that the independent commission is seen to be removed from political interference.  It has taken nearly 30 years to get to the stage where there is an acceptance of the independence of the commission.  I am not too sure of the benefits involved in any submissions to the commission by the public.  A high percentage of the submissions were about the sub-division of Leitrim, but they did not seem to be taken on board.  When the terms of reference are brought before the Oireachtas, it is important there is a lengthy discussion on them so the views of practising politicians are brought to bear and laid before the independent commission.I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  The most important thing is that we in this House make sure that everything done is for the betterment of democracy at every level.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Normally I welcome the opportunity to contribute to debates, but I am not sure of the purpose of this debate.  Why we are having statements when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has told us that drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage?  That says more about the lack of Bills to be debated before the summer recess than about anything else.  In his speech, the Minister attempted to lecture us about a "need for real action" on this issue.  He even quoted the judgment of Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, mentioning the urgent constitutional imperative of the Oireachtas to deal with this disparity.  Where is the urgency of the Government in response to that judgment?  It certainly is not evident by having statements in the House.  If there was a real need for action, then there would be no talking shop exercise this afternoon.  Instead, there would be a Bill before us to address the issues and to which we could table amendments and on which we could vote.  I agree that action is needed but the responsibility for that action lies with the Minister.I have a vested interest in this matter, and this report has a fairly drastic effect on me personally and on the constituency I represent.  The electoral commission decided, perhaps not in its wisdom, to implement changes that have left a great degree of anger and confusion in my constituency, especially in south Offaly.  They may be rejoicing in other parts of the constituency about the way things have turned out.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say the changes are small and involve a relatively minor relocation of population.  He cited the constituency of Laois-Offaly as an example.  Clearly that is now the perceived Government view, and I assume he speaks for all Government parties, despite the efforts of some in Deputy Kitt's party to give a contrary view.This commission was given its terms of reference by the outgoing Government last year.  The anomalies that have been thrown up could have been reduced had clearer terms of reference been drawn.  I agree the Constitution takes precedence, but why then has the Government tried to create the impression that this is not the case?  Perhaps the Government has considered that the best way to resolve this would be to include the issue of county boundaries in the Constitution.  However, I doubt that the Government will call for a constitutional referendum to deal with that issue.The Minister has a responsibility to bring this legislation forward.  He confirmed for us today that the Taoiseach had no real basis for his suggestion that this House could make changes.  He is espousing the Government view that precedent should not be broken.  If that is the Government view, then I am not sure what we are trying to attempt with this exercise.  What happened to the Taoiseach's all-party committee and his need for consensus?  What happened his feeling, as voiced by one of his local councillors in Offaly, that "as an elected representative he should have some input into it"?  Has that view changed?  Is precedent going to be the order of the day?  Perhaps the Minister has finally found a voice and realises that if he hands the power to decide constituencies to Fianna Fáil, his party will never make another electoral gain.It is little coincidence that Fianna Fáil TDs and councillors around the country have been spinning the same line on the issue. This line was also spun by their leader.  Perhaps he will join in this exercise today and make a statement outlining the changes he proposes.  How 166 TDs would ever reach a consensus on this is beyond me, but there is no doubt that the Government would have an in-built majority, which is the Fianna Fáil style of consensus.  It is their way, or no way.  Fianna Fáil politicians have toured the areas affected telling people they will fix the problem if the other parties agree, yet they have offered no solution to the problem.  Perhaps they should start by telling the truth that they have a majority in this House and can do what they want anyway.  It is not the Opposition they need to back their proposal, but rather the three Government parties and the few Independents.  Together they can vote in or out whatever Bills they want.  The Government accepts very few amendments put forward by the Opposition, so our view is ignored when it suits, but we are also wanted for consensus when it suits.The Taoiseach found the report we are discussing to be anomalous, but the Government still appointed the judge who chaired that commission to be chair of the commission charged with informing the public about the Lisbon referendum, something the Taoiseach said is the top priority.  If somebody acted outside his or her on the electoral commission, should he or she be allowed carry out this vitally important role?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the Government's thinking on this.Let there be no doubt that the people of south Offaly want to continue to vote in the constituency of Laois-Offaly.  Let there be no doubt that I also want them to be able to vote there.  It lacks common sense to breach a provincial boundary.  I am one of the worst affected TDs by this decision, but I do not pretend the commission should take my position into its considerations.  However, the members of the commission should listen to the people from the area.  The area to be changed to Tipperary North forms part of the Birr electoral area, which I served in Offaly County Council from 1999 and which my father represented from 1967.  Shinrone is the heart of the area and has been my parents' family home for many generations.  I have a strong allegiance to the area and have enjoyed serving the people there.  Regardless of this report, I will continue to serve the people in the area but would like the opportunity to do so in an official capacity as well.I know the people of south Offaly and they have no allegiance to Tipperary North.  They find it incongruous that they should be shunted into that area.  It also leads to a great deal of confusion.  If the Government fell and a general election was to be held on the same day as local and European elections, who would be responsible for ordering the polling booths on that day and who would be the returning officers?  Would they be from Tipperary North or from Offaly?  People would be voting for Offaly County Council in local elections, in the constituency of Ireland East or Leinster in European elections and in North Tipperary, which is a different area of responsibility, in respect of the general election.They are also being asked to vote for candidates who have no affinity with the area although this can be built up.

We should not underestimate the strength of resolve in this regard.  Having discussed this matter with the people of south Offaly over the past few months, they want to vote in south Offaly and they also want to vote in a democracy.  They do not want to vote under conditions whereby any party in Government can decide the boundaries of a constituency.  People will put the opportunity to vote in a democracy first.Rather than using this as a roll of lament for our individual losses, the Government should have used this opportunity to tell us exactly what it proposes.  It has been talked to death in the areas affected and not one concrete proposal for change has been put forward.  People should remember that while everyone thinks the changes in their constituency are the most important, the smallest change will have a domino effect on every other constituency.  Any one change could make the legislation unconstitutional.  Rather than hearing the Government talk about this issue, I want to hear how it will deal with it.  The idea of all-party consensus is neither here nor there because the Government has a majority.  The Government should tell us how it will use its majority, ensure the proposal is constitutional and also how it will be free from interference from politicians in a process in which we all have a vested interest.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I am glad to speak on this and it is important that we have an opportunity to contribute.  I do not know what the outcome will be and it is probably a cynical exercise making statements on this matter, but I am bitterly disappointed at the findings and the report of the Constituency Commission.  I am not crying for my own sake but speaking for the people I represent in the constituency of Limerick West.  The constituency has been decimated by the findings of the Constituency Commission.  Reference has been made to small changes and tweaking made throughout the constituencies and I understand that this is needed to ensure the appropriate number of constituents per Deputy.  It is possible to satisfy the constitutional requirements in this way.In my case, every voter west of Newcastle West has changed from Limerick West to the new constituency of Kerry North-Limerick West.  The population of 13,000 has been disenfranchised by the findings.  We have lost this amount and gained 17,000, but the Constituency Commission did not respect county boundaries in doing so.  The earlier speaker referred to how it did not respect provincial boundaries.  I respect the fact that the Constituency Commission has a job to do but until such time as there is political input into this, it will not be right.  Deputies in this Chamber are like turkeys facing Christmas on a five-year basis.  We must face this dilemma after a census of the population and it is not good enough.  I accept the independence of the Constituency Commission and that the past system was far from independent and did not work.  That is the reason this job of work was put into the hands of independent people.  I accept that it has a job to do, but I am bitterly disappointed with its findings.A population shift of 13,000 from the town of Newcastle West means that if one drives along the N21, people three miles east of the town cannot vote in Limerick West.  They have been disenfranchised.  Members on all sides of the House encourage people to vote but the message of the people of Abbeyfeale, Athea, Mountcollins, Toornafulla, Monagea, Carrigkerry and other places is that they will not vote because there is no possibility of electing a Limerick Deputy while this situation prevails.  These people are disenfranchised and they are disgusted by it.  They were satisfied by the representation of those they chose at election time, as was their right and entitlement, but this has been taken from them.Our loss is the gain of Kerry North and I wish the people of Kerry North well.  We are proud of our identity in Limerick, particularly in Limerick West.  While we have an affinity with north Kerry in some circumstances, this is not such an occasion.  Other speakers referred to the Taoiseach's suggestion in the House.  Deputy Michael Kennedy feels strongly on this matter and made efforts so that this report could be made an interim report.  If the glaring discrepancies could have been rectified, all-party agreement could have been reached.  With 166 Deputies, it is a case of swings and roundabouts, losses and gains, but, on this occasion, the people of Limerick West are the losers.The Taoiseach was sensible in suggesting, before he assumed office, that we must have some political input in future years.  I support that and it is a pity that we cannot have such an input on this occasion.  It is not because it affects Deputy John Cregan — it will be somebody else the next time.  The report of the Constituency Commission is not sacrosanct and does not have to be adopted and rubber-stamped by this House.  The precedent is that it always has been but the House is under no obligation to accept the findings of the Constituency Commission.  That was a safeguard in itself, although it was never used.  Another safeguard could be built in so that we could use it from time to time, if necessary.I am getting the negative part of my contribution out of the way first because I will be more positive in welcoming my new constituents when I make a further contribution later this afternoon.  This is a source of concern to my colleagues in Limerick West and those decent people who cast votes for all three of us and to whom we provide a service to the best of our ability and will continue to serve out of loyalty.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It is a matter of concern that the number of murders involving knives or sharp instruments doubled from 18 in 2006 to 36 last year.  I should add, however, that the overall number of incidents involving such weapons recorded by the Garda Síochána decreased from 1,138 in 2006 to 934 in 2007.Our legislation already prescribes strong penalties for offences involving the use of knives and similar weapons.  The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 and the Offensive Weapons Order 1991, which contain the criminal law in this area, lay down strict prohibitions on such weapons and severe penalties for breaking those prohibitions.  Indeed, our law generally provides heavy penalties for offences involving weapons.  A person found guilty of murder through stabbing or otherwise is liable to the highest possible penalty of a mandatory life sentence.Earlier this year, my predecessor as Minister asked the Garda Commissioner to review the law in this area to see whether further measures should be taken.  The Commissioner recently finalised his review and my Department is currently examining it.  If necessary, we will strengthen our law even further.  In considering this matter, we must be conscious that it would not be practical to ban or restrict many of the knives or similar weapons often used in attacks as they have legitimate uses in the home and workplaces.  We must target instead their possession in inappropriate circumstances.The Garda Policing Plan 2008, which reflects the priorities set for the force by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Garda Síochána Act, contains a series of measures to target the use of knives and similar offensive weapons for violent attacks.  As well as taking rigorous action under the criminal law against those found carrying such weapons, the Garda will launch later this year a media campaign addressing this behaviour.The use of knives and other weapons can arise in the context of incidents of public disorder and excessive consumption of alcohol.  The Garda Policing Plan 2008 includes actions to proactively target groups and individuals involved in anti-social behaviour and to identify hotspots where such behaviour is taking place.  The Government yesterday approved legislation to address the sale of intoxicating liquor from which anti-social behaviour often results and this will be published shortly.Additional  information not given on the floor of the House.Policing by An Garda Síochána of communities is a key factor in addressing this type of behaviour.  Significant progress is being made to increase the strength of the force to 15,000 by 2010.  The current attested strength of the force on 30 April was 13,874.  Furthermore, hundreds of extra civilian staff have been recruited to free up gardaí for frontline policing.I am sure the House will agree that we need to get the message across to young people in particular that carrying knives or other offensive weapons is dangerous and wrong and can lead to disastrous consequences.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Government has been in office for one year during which time there has been a 27% increase in murders, a 20% increase in firearms offences, as published today and a 31% increase in drug-related offences.  Ireland has become a more violent and vicious place in which to live.In 2003, eight murders were attributed to knife crime.  By 2006 this number had increased to 23 and in 2007 to 36.  I put it to the Minister that this dramatic increase in knife-related murders needs to be addressed.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brian Lenihan, earlier this year stated the Garda Síochána was at his request conducting a review in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister will set out for us the nature of that review and say whether it has been completed.  If so, what are the terms of the review?I am disappointed to learn from the Minister's reply that he does not envisage any legislative change in this area.  Is it the intention of the Garda Síochána, in conjunction with the Minister, to ensure areas of high incidence of crime are identified and subjected to greater police concentration with particular reference to knives, offensive weapons, swords and sharp objectives which are being used not only to maim people but to murder them and to terrorise communities?  Very little has been done in recent times to address this issue.  Perhaps the Minister will outline to the House his proposals in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	227	As I stated in my reply, the Garda Commissioner's report in this regard was recently received by my Department.  The report makes a number of small suggestions in respect of changes in this area, including in respect of powers of search, the prohibition of swords and providing that some summary offences be tried on indictment.  I have indicated previously that I will use the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which it is hoped will be available in the next couple of months, as the legislative vehicle to make the changes recommended by the Garda Commissioner.I raised the issue of the use of knives with the Garda Commissioner at my first meeting with him and sought assurance from him that the commitment given by him to my predecessor in regard to the targeting of hotspots at which young people with knives congregate, in the context of alcohol, will be implemented.  As I stated in my reply, the Government has fast-tracked some elements of the report on the sale of alcohol and has approved the Bill, which it is expected will be published shortly, in regard to the taking of intoxicating liquor in public places and public disorder.What is required at the end of the day is targeted action by the Garda Síochána.  As I stated earlier, the Garda will shortly conduct a media campaign directed at young people in particular to try to ensure they are aware of the dangers of carrying such knives.  The Garda Síochána has unprecedented resources available to it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The findings of the sixth report of the Morris tribunal are disturbing not only for the public but for the overwhelming majority of members of the Garda Síochána who are conscientious and honourable and who have been badly let down by some of their colleagues.  It finds that a number of persons were unlawfully arrested and detained and that some were mistreated in custody through verbal and, in some cases, physical abuse.  This followed directly or indirectly from the investigation into the death of Mr. Richard Barron in Donegal in 1996, which itself was dealt with comprehensively in the tribunal's second report published in June 2005.The reports of the Morris tribunal have influenced greatly the policy changes underpinning the Garda Síochána Act 2005, a comprehensive reform of the law relating to the Garda Síochána.  Among other things, the Act established the Garda Ombudsman Commission, put in place new and more streamlined discipline regulations, imposed a statutory duty on members to account for their actions while on duty and reformed the system of Garda promotions.  If these measures had been in place in the late 1990s, there might never have been a need for the Morris tribunal.It is difficult to find any comfort in the report but I am heartened that it found to be false a claim that conversations between solicitors and persons detained in Letterkenny Garda station were secretly recorded by members of the Garda Síochána.The Garda Commissioner has unambiguously apologised to those found by the tribunal to have been mistreated.  He is now examining the latest report carefully with a view to addressing the findings as they relate to individual members.Looking ahead, the report makes a number of recommendations arising from its findings, mainly centred on how improvements could be made to the law and practice relating to the conduct of interviews with persons in Garda custody but also touching on other aspects of Garda investigations.  I will consider these recommendations carefully and I will consult with the Garda Commissioner on emerging proposals for change.  We should also be mindful that the tribunal's two final reports are due to be submitted soon, perhaps as early as next month.  Members will then have an opportunity to debate all of the reports' findings and recommendations.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This will complete the substantive work of the tribunal.  Mr. Justice Morris and his team deserve the appreciation of this House for this achievement.  They have exposed the truth of what happened in Donegal in the 1990s and their findings and recommendations which have been the inspiration for comprehensive reform of the Garda Síochána will serve the force and the people well into the future.

The system of whistleblowing will become operational once the charter is in place, has been submitted and is approved by me.  When it is in place, it will provide a major opportunity for those conscientious members of the Garda Síochána who wish to make a whistleblowing complaint.  If it had been in place during the time of the incidents which arose relating to the Morris tribunal, perhaps the tribunal would not have been necessary.

Has he had any reports from other parts of the country about the type of malpractices dealt with by the Morris tribunal?

I have not received such information since I became Minister.  As a result of the changes made in 2005, the Garda Ombudsman Commission is now up and running and has received a substantial number of complaints on issues brought to its attention by members of the public.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission, which replaced the Garda Complaints Board, is a good vehicle.  People such as Deputy Rabbitte encouraged it to be put in place to allow these issues to be dealt with so we do not have tribunals.  Those gardaí who tend to operate in this way will be cognisant of the fact that stringent conditions and legislation are in place to deal with it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Is it the case that the Garda Ombudsman Commission may not deal with allegations of routine dereliction of duty within the Garda Síochána?  I have had a number of contacts from within the Garda since the latest Morris report was published.  At least three of these cases detail routine dereliction of duty, malpractice, misconduct and indiscipline, matters proper to the management structure within the Garda and with which the Garda Ombudsman Commission does not and cannot deal.I know the Minister is in the job a short time and as Minister for Foreign Affairs he was, perhaps, more removed from the work on the ground than the rest of us.  I am surprised if the Minister can honestly state to the House that Mr. Justice Frederick Morris was wrong when he concluded that there is routine indiscipline and worse in other parts of the country.

Under section 2 of the Act, the act must be a sexual offence under the law of the place it was done and, had it been done within this State, would have constituted an offence listed in the Schedule to the Act.The recently enacted Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 also contains jurisdictional provisions which ensure that Irish citizens and persons ordinarily resident in the State who commit trafficking offences abroad can be prosecuted in the State in respect of those offences.I am at present preparing a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill which will include several new offences aimed at offering further protection to children and other vulnerable persons against sexual exploitation and abuse.  It is my intention to include in that Bill jurisdictional provisions similar to those in the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	236	This question specifically arose as a result of the final report of the review inquiry into what has become known as the McElwee case.  In June 2004, it was alleged that an Irish citizen, employed by the Midland Health Board and engaged in work for the child and youth care learning centre in Athlone Institute of Technology, sexually assaulted an individual while on a visit to Amsterdam to research issues relating to drugs and young people.  Ultimately, this resulted in a conviction in the courts in July 2005.In July 2004, an inquiry came from the Dutch authorities to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to whether a prosecution could be taken in this State and, in October 2004, the DPP stated it could not.  One of the charges related to an alleged sexual assault on a 16 year old for which a conviction was ultimately sustained through the Dutch courts.  The Minister may not be aware of the full detail of this case and, if not, he can communicate with me.Will the reform the Minister intends to bring forward cover this type of incident?  Will he ensure that in all circumstances where an Irish citizen abroad commits a sexual offence against a young person the offence is prosecutable at home?  Obviously, it must be in circumstances where the alleged victim is available to give evidence in this State.  Will the Minister ensure this particular issue is dealt with?Arising out of the McElwee case, it emerged that despite the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was notified of the original alleged offence and subsequently was directly involved in facilitating the Dutch authorities in serving the summons on the person convicted, the Department failed to inquire as to the outcome of the proceedings.  It was only in June and July 2007 that it became publicly known, forcing this man to resign from his position and to cease working as a consultant to the Midland Health Board.The House was told that a meeting was to be convened as a matter of urgency involving senior officials from the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that, in future, the Children First guidelines are abided by.  Has this meeting happened?  Despite the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform having information on this matter from 2004 onwards, it failed to communicate it to any other body of relevance and by 2005 it had been made aware that the person involved was working in the child care area.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Another question has been tabled on the McElwee case and I am aware of the circumstances of it.  One of the reasons we propose to change the legislation is to tighten up the situation, not necessarily flowing from this particular case.  For this new legislation, we have taken on board the views of various bodies, including the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights Commission and what flowed from the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Child Protection on the 2007 Council for Europe convention against sexual exploitation and the sexual abuse of children.  It was part of an overall Bill but because we wanted to fast track dealing with human trafficking, we brought it forward as a separate Bill, which, as the Deputy knows, will come into law on 7 June.A Bill on sexual offences will be brought forward and will take care of the situation provided a similar offence exists in this jurisdiction to that committed by the person.  In all circumstances where a similarity exists between the offence committed in the foreign jurisdiction and this jurisdiction, it would be possible to ground a prosecution here.Will the Deputy table a specific question on whether the meeting has taken place?  I expect a meeting has taken place and meetings are taking place on a constant basis.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	238	As part of a general review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 last year, the extension of the Act to An Garda Síochána was considered.  That consideration involved an examination of all factors relevant to the governance, oversight and accountability of An Garda Síochána.  Since the passage of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, An Garda Síochána and the regulatory and administrative landscape in which it operates have been undergoing massive change.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission was established.  The Garda inspectorate was established and it has produced three reports with major implications for the structure and operation of the force.  In the past year the senior civilian management positions of chief administrative officer and director of communications were created.  More civilians are being recruited for key posts as legal adviser, director of information and communications technology and director of change management.At the same time, the ranks of attested members and the numbers of civilian staff have been expanded.  In light of this extensive and fast-moving change, it was decided that to extend the FOI Act to the Garda at this time would place an excessive administrative burden on the its resources as the force continues to discharge its challenging core duties, in particular that of tackling crime.  For all these reasons it was decided not to extend the FOI Act to An Garda Síochána at this time, but to keep the matter under review.  In this regard, I intend to be guided by the overall public interest which lies in maintaining an appropriately accountable police force which is not distracted from its key tasks of safeguarding public safety and security.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Does the Minister not agree it is perverse to plead overdue Garda reforms as a reason for not extending the FOI Act to the force?  He is known in the House as a cautious and conservative politician.  If he wants to make a name of himself in asserting real accountability, he should extend the Act to the Garda.  What is his response to the Information Commissioner's statement that Ireland is out of kilter in this regard with other developed democracies?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	240	With regard to making a name for myself in regard to freedom of information, I am the only Minister who was ever threatened with Circuit Court proceedings by the Data Protection Commissioner.  When I was Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I wanted to provide replies to freedom of information requests but the commissioner had huge problems with what I was doing.  On her first day in office, the Information Commissioner during an interview on the Pat Kenny show found fault with what I was doing at the time, which was putting all the FOI requests made of the Department on the Internet as replies became available.  I was stymied to a certain extent in this regard.  The Data Protection Commissioner served a 20 day notice on me saying he would take me to the Circuit Court unless I changed my ways.  As a result of negotiations between him and the Attorney General, thankfully, I more or less got my way.  I have, therefore, made my name on freedom on information.However, the Deputy will have to accept dealing with files in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is quite different, particularly in the context of my years as Minister for Foreign Affairs when I dealt with many issues relating to subversive activity against the State.  It would be ludicrous that the FOI Act would be extended to such activity.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I would like to have a cup of tea with the Minister to go over his fascinating trip down memory lane, which is utterly——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Minister is only flim flamming.  What is his reply to the Information Commissioner's repeated request that the FOI Act be extended to the Garda?  Nobody is suggesting we put the security of the State at risk and we are not asking for files on subversive activity.  What is his response to her recent report?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I gave my response in my original reply.  It is not feasible at this stage.  It would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the Garda even in regard to issues that are not security determined.  At the end of the day, Members say in the House that we do not have sufficient gardaí.  The Government is on an upward scale recruiting.  A total of 1,100 gardaí are in training in order that we reach the commitment that we made to increase the force's strength to 15,000 by 2010.  This is partly being done to ensure gardaí are fighting crime.  If their time is taken up answering freedom of information requests, Members such as the Deputy will be the first to complain that they are sitting in their offices answering such requests.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	245	That is a lamentable reply and it is regrettable the new Minister has a philosophical and ideological opposition to the FOI Act being extended to the Garda.  This is an instrument of accountability and if we have learned anything from the Morris tribunal and elsewhere, there is a necessity to improve accountability within the Garda.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I do not accept that.  There is oodles of accountability in the Garda Ombudsman Commission, the inspectorate and all the other changes that have taken place since the Morris tribunal.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I must stress I have had no role in regard to the inception, detail or design of the campaign in question.  As the Deputy noted, the fifth annual Say No to Ageism Week campaign ran this year between 19 May and 23 May.  It was launched by my colleague, Deputy Máire Hoctor, Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  It is a joint initiative of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, NCAOP, the Health Service Executive and the Equality Authority.  The total cost of the campaign for 2008 was €225,000, funded equally by the three organising agencies.  Say No to Ageism Week seeks to respond to ageism by highlighting it and by illustrating how ageism operates in society, in the workplace and in the provision of services.  The campaign also promotes and supports practical action by organisations to develop "age friendly" service provision.  A combination of outdoor advertising, cinema advertising, posters and local and national radio was used throughout the week.This year's poster campaign had a particular focus on how stereotypical labels can be applied to older people and on how this labelling depersonalises, diminishes and excludes older people.  Observers were challenged to examine their attitudes towards older people as compared to young people.  The concept was developed by the Equality Authority and approved by the steering committee for the week, which included representatives of the HSE and the NCAOP.  The council was represented by the chair of its communications advisory committee and by its communications officer.  I am assured there was no intention to offend either older or young people.As the Deputy rightly acknowledges, ageist attitudes can adversely affect people across all age groups.  The Equality Authority is also engaged in an initiative to challenge the negative stereotyping of young people.  This campaign, entitled Give Stereotyping the Boot, is running in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  This and other campaigns are conducted by the Equality Authority under its broad mandate under the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to combat discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity in the areas covered by the Acts.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Equality Authority is an independent statutory body with its own board and a separate legal personality, and is independent in the exercise of these statutory functions.   The chief executive of the authority is accountable to the Dáil for the economy and efficiency of the authority in the use of its resources, and the systems, procedures and practices employed by the authority to evaluate the effectiveness of its operations.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Does the Minister accept the authority comes under his remit and he funds it?  Does he agree it was an outrageous misuse of public funds to spend €225,000 on reinforcing stereotypes of old people and not challenging them?  Does he further agree this foolish and ill-conceived campaign could do nothing other than promote ageism as opposed to counteract it?  Does he further accept putting up posters of elderly people throughout the country in bus shelters, on buses and in other locations with descriptions of them as a "burden", "grumpy", "forgotten" and "useless" can make no proper contribution to ensuring a lack of discrimination against old people and can only guarantee and ensure unthinking people will use those labels as a verbal means of putting old people down?  Does the Minister agree many elderly people who saw these advertisements found them grossly offensive and distressing?  Will he direct the Equality Authority to apply more common sense in future to the spending of public funds on promotional campaigns designed to end discrimination but which, if one applies common sense to them, can do nothing to resolve the problem they are supposed to address?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The Equality Authority is an independent statutory body and it is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions.  It is not within my remit to run it on a day-to-day basis.  The authority must take into account the views expressed by public representatives such as the Deputy, particularly given he raised them in the House.  The Equality Authority could be called to one of the committees of the Oireachtas in order to answer questions in respect of this because it is required under the legislation to come before Dáil committees so I suggest that Deputy Shatter does that.In respect of the reaction, it must be said that to our knowledge, only one negative comment has been communicated to the Equality Authority and this has been from a young person.  All of the major NGOs in the area of older people were at the overall launch.  For example, Age Action Ireland carried the poster on its website for several days before the launch and throughout the week of the campaign.  Indeed, in a letter to The Irish Times on 26 May, Age Action Ireland referred to the current campaign as being “timely and badly needed”, noting that “age discrimination is widespread across society”.  While Deputy Shatter may have a view on it and may be correct, there are others who feel the opposite to that.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Does the Minister acknowledge that if the Equality Authority were to decide to run a similar campaign to counteract racism, religious discrimination or discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation and put up posters of poor photographs of people with insulting labels attached to them, that would result in a national outcry?  What is the Minister's personal view of this campaign?  I have had overwhelming support for comments I publicly made criticising this campaign.   Would the Minister consider that the reason people have not communicated their concern about this campaign to the Equality Authority and other organisations involved is because they simply felt that it was pointless to do so?

Obviously, I would not want any agency under my authority to promote something that would cause difficulty and annoyance for people.  There is no doubt that the authority should bear in mind that it must be very careful in what it does but to be fair, it was endeavouring as much as possible to highlight the issue of assisting older people in their lives.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	255	There are a total of 703 Garda stations throughout the country ranging from large 24-hour divisional and district HQ stations to smaller rural stations.  This wide geographical spread of Garda stations is a valuable resource for local communities even in cases where small stations are open to the public for only a number of hours per week.  They provide an important link between the gardaí and the public they serve.  I know in this context that the question of opening hours is often and perfectly reasonably raised but a point to bear in mind is that an increase in the opening hours of any Garda station or the opening of additional stations necessitates the deployment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who could be deployed, in many cases more effectively, on outdoor policing duties.Rural policing and engagement with the rural community are key priorities of the Garda Síochána and this objective goes much wider than the physical presence of stations, important though that is.  The current establishment of joint policing committees will provide a forum for discussion of local policing issues in each local authority area and will further enhance the relationship between the Garda Siochána, local communities and their public representatives.Returning to the question of Garda stations, a total of €260 million is assigned for stations and other Garda accommodation under the current national development plan.  In addition, a budget of €9.5 million is available this year alone for the maintenance of Garda premises.  This has enabled a significant ongoing programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda stations and other Garda accommodation around the country.I should also say that a high-level strategic Garda accommodation board with members drawn from the Garda Síochána, the OPW and my Department has been established to carry out a review of Garda accommodation and, in particular, to prepare a short-term and longer-term strategy for all accommodation.  The board is also considering how best to progress the rural Garda station replacement programme.  The aim of this programme is to replace older and outdated stations that are expensive to maintain with smaller and more efficient stations to meet modern policing needs.  Of course, ultimately the allocation of Garda resources, including accommodation, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide in accordance with the operational requirements of the force and I look forward to the report from the Commissioner on the board's deliberations later this year.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he meet with the Garda Commissioner at an early date to initiate a review on the matter of rural policing?  How many Garda stations have closed and ceased operating since his party came to power in 1997?  How many Garda stations are now operating on short time?In the late 1990s, his Government initiated the "green man" scheme where the operation of some rural Garda stations was put under the auspices of a machine.  Has any benefit analysis been done as to the efficiencies, drawbacks and difficulties attached to the green man system?The population change and social mobility of the past number of years have given rise to a situation where there is a need to review the Garda stations.  Does the Minister accept that the vast rural area of the Beara peninsula has no Garda station and has one garda covering an entire expansive area?  What does the Minister propose to do in this regard?  Does he accept there is a need to rebalance the location of Garda stations in accordance with the growth of population and population structures and that a review is needed at a root and branch level at this stage?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	257	The gardaí are currently reviewing this situation and a number of changes are pending in respect of the divisional boundaries as they impact on rural policing.  I have met the Garda Commissioner quite a number of times since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a few weeks ago.  One of the issues that arose concerned rural policing, which is a key priority for the Garda plan.The Deputy criticised my party but when his party was last in power, not one extra garda set foot in rural Ireland.  To my knowledge, there are no proposals in respect of the opening or closing of Garda stations other than one planned merger of stations in Cork city which is proposed under the policing plan, although it is an issue for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the annual policing plan which he is required to bring forward under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and lay before the House.  Obviously, the planned merger is to be proposed by the Commissioner.It is planned to build approximately 80 rural Garda stations to replace existing older stations to change some of the old accommodation in which gardaí must survive.  New stations are being built in Ballymun, Trim, Claremorris, Leixlip, Irishtown and Finglas. The  new station in Kevin Street in Dublin will the largest station ever built in the State.  There will be work on stations in Ballingarry in County Tipperary, Urlingford in County Kilkenny, Donard in County Wicklow, Carberry in County Kildare and a new station in Oranmore in County Galway.  The Garda Vote for maintenance is €9.521 million for 2008, which is an increase of more than €1.2 million on last year's budget provision.

In the specific context of the reordering of the Garda divisions along county boundaries, that will give rise to a situation where specific Garda stations in parts of the country where the jurisdictional changes will impact will require specific targeted upgrading, which is not included on the list as mentioned by the Minister.  This issue must be looked at as a matter of some urgency in the context of the divisional changes.

What we need is a change in direction.  I compliment the work of community gardaí and can see their work on the ground.  Surely it is time to progress that and open up and re-establish more rural Garda stations, in growth centres and larger areas of population, if needs be.  Surely there are premises available that the Garda Síochána can work out of and provide a service to the public.

Under the policing plan prepared by the Garda Síochána, focus has been placed on intelligence gathering in the context of the targeting of elderly people by criminal gangs and that has been reasonably successful.  Indeed, a major criminal gang from the south of the country, which targeted elderly people in the Cork and Limerick areas, has been broken up and is currently before the courts.  Good Garda intelligence on the ground dealing with the situation is important, as is ensuring that Garda accommodation is as required.On the green man issue, I suggest the Deputy tables a separate question on the efficacy of that project.

Rather than taking up time reading the breakdown of those numbers across more than 70 stations, the details will be appended to the reply and placed on the record of the House.The establishment of the Garda reserve, a measure supported on all sides in this House, is one of the most important and welcome innovations in policing in Ireland in recent years.  The establishment of the reserve has helped the Garda Síochána to strengthen its links with local communities and reserve members are a source of local support and knowledge.  The reserve allows committed individuals from a great diversity of professional, social, cultural and ethnic groups to take part in policing.  Reserve gardaí are bringing a special commitment and enthusiasm to the Garda organisation through their voluntary service.  They are helping to bring a fresh and innovative approach to policing as they undertake their duties in support of their full-time colleagues with the different perspectives and skills developed in their everyday jobs and lives.An Agreed Programme for Government set a target strength for the reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force.  In the annual policing plan for 2008, the Garda Commissioner set a target of recruiting 270 reserve members this year.  As the Garda reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is making every effort to reach the recruitment target.Station by Station Assignment of Attested Reserve Members:Dublin Metropolitan Region: Pearse Street (19), Kevin Street (5), Kilmainham (3), Donnybrook (6), Store Street (9), Bridewell (6), Fitzgibbon Street (6), Clondalkin (2), Finglas (4), Lucan (5), Ballyfermot (3), Blanchardstown (11), Ronanstown (1), Santry (2), Raheny (3), Swords (3), Clontarf (2), Coolock (3), Ballymun (2), Balbriggan (3), Malahide (1), Howth (1), Crumlin (2), Sundrive Road (1), Rathmines (2), Terenure (2), Tallaght (2), Rathfarnham (2), Bray (3), Dún Laoghaire (3) and Blackrock (4).

There is a high level of attrition among those who apply, for a myriad of reasons.  Some applicants were not available for interview when called, others were not able to take up training, many have joined the full-time Garda force and quite a number did not meet the selection criteria.  The recruitment process is run through the Public Appointments Service.  In the first quarter of 2008, 172 applicants were interviewed, 109 of whom were approved, which is a significant figure.

Given the lack of impact of the members of the reserve force, how can the Minister stand over the significant spending on this service?  Is the Minister aware that the cost to date is in the region of €500,000, almost €135,000 of which was spent on advertising alone?  Has the Minister given full consideration to the cost of engaging a chief superintendent, a superintendent, several sergeants and a large number of other gardaí in the training and supervision of this tiny reserve force?  Does he agree that the Garda reserve will not and cannot be a substitute for full-time, trained gardaí?  The Minister should concentrate on civilianisation to ensure that gardaí are more effective, are on the beat and deal directly with crime.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I put it to the Minister that this has been a most disappointing campaign on the part of the Government.  The Garda reserve process has resulted in failure.  It was the brainchild of a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell who is on record as stating that the Government target would see figures in the order of 900 reservists by 2006.  The programme for Government is committed to a force of 1,500.  The numbers are already in decline.  The Minister's response today indicates that there are currently 261 attested members.  A parliamentary question answered on 4 March indicated that the figures for January were 277, including 60 in training.  These people are falling off the back of the trailer already because there is no commitment on the part of the Government to the Garda reserve operation.  I put it to the Minister that it has been a failure.

The concept of a reserve Garda force is welcome, but only if it is operated correctly.  I assume reservists train in Templemore.  I tabled several parliamentary questions concerning the fact that there is an enormous strain on the training resources, both human and physical, in Templemore.  Has the Minister plans to improve the training facilities of the Garda Síochána?

The current level of funding for the recruiting and training of the Garda reserve force is in the region of €600,000 per year, which is a reasonable figure in the context of an overall sum of €1.6 billion for the Garda Síochána Vote.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Perhaps that is the problem.  Does the Minister consider it might be the problem?

That is one of the reasons there are plans to consider revamping the facilities in Templemore.  However, that is the result of a successful campaign by the Government to increase the Garda numbers to 15,000 by 2010.

In one case, relating to certain aspects of the fixed charge processing system, he recommended an examination.  In the other, relating to the subject of this question, he was not persuaded of the need for an examination at that time.  Clearly I will keep this under review, as my predecessor would have but I, like him, need convincing arguments to persuade me to request an examination under section 106 at this stage.It is fair to say that an examination under section 106, with its objective of preventing or reducing the incidence of particular types of complaints, would normally arise from significant experience of complaints sufficient to identify patterns or trends.  That might not always be necessary, and clearly the particular circumstances of the recommendation on the fixed charge processing system enabled my predecessor to request such an examination, but it certainly was the general expectation behind the section, and understandably so.The Ombudsman Commission has been in operation for more than one year and its experience of the trends and patterns of complaints is still developing.  I am conscious, too, that it has a heavy workload of complaints to deal with, and I am anxious not to overburden it with additional tasks at this time, unless it is clearly necessary.I will, therefore, keep this matter under review in the light of the developing experience of the Ombudsman Commission, and I will remain in dialogue with it.

Is the Minister aware that one of the costliest ongoing Garda operations is that taking place in Bellanaboy?  Is he further aware that last year Mr. Joe Gannon, the superintendent in charge there said in response to an interview for an article in the Garda Review that:There were no arrests.  That was part of our strategy: we did not want to facilitate anyone down there with a route to martyrdom.  That has been the policy ever since.Is the Minister aware that policy has resulted in 70 complaints being made to the Garda Ombudsman because the Garda approach has been one of substituting lawful arrest with its own form of brute enforcement in the area and that this included brutal and cowardly assaults on protestors by members of the Garda Síochána?  Is he also aware that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is in agreement with Sinn Féin that a review of the Garda approach would help reduce the potential for further abuses, but would also reduce the number of complaints?I ask the Minister, in his limitless wisdom, in contrast to the phrase used to describe the previous Minister, to give serious consideration to this matter, given the extent of Garda resources dedicated to policing, crowd and protest management in the Bellanaboy area.  Will the Minister allow the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to do its job more efficiently by undertaking a general investigation into how the gardaí police protests and crowd control?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The simple answer is no, I will not, not in this instance.  The members of the Garda Síochána deployed in Bellanaboy or anywhere else have a duty to ensure that there are no breaches of criminal law.  I compliment them on the work they do on a constant basis, not only there but elsewhere throughout the country in preventing crowd disturbance and dealing with public order issues that are not acceptable within the law.The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is a new body that is up and running.  It has received a significant number of complaints.  I heard what the Deputy said about the number that have been received from people in the Bellanaboy area.  The commission has a staff of 101 personnel, a budget of more than €11.5 million and, to a large extent, is dealing with the initial surge of complaints that it has received.  I do not believe that I should add to that burden by what I would regard as an unnecessary investigation in this instance under the legislation under which it was set up.

It is regrettable that important Garda resources are used for many of these incidents that have occurred throughout the country on a planned basis.  I refer to Bellanaboy, as mentioned by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, and protests in Shannon.  Policing these incidents involves a considerable cost for the Garda.  Has the Minister any plans to bring forward legislation to provide that those who are found guilty of pre-planned public order offences might have to pay for the cost of Garda overtime and the waste of Garda resources?

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of persons who were on bail at the time of the recording of a criminal incident in respect of which they were suspected.  These figures are readily available only in respect of the years 2004 to 2007.  While the commission of every crime is to be deplored, I accept fully that the commission of offences by persons while on bail is an issue of considerable concern.The law already takes a serious view of such offences.  The Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides for mandatory consecutive sentences to apply where a person is convicted of an offence committed while on bail.  In addition, the law provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.The granting of bail is a matter for the courts.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the performance of his functions, represents the State for the purposes of dealing with such applications.  It would obviously not be appropriate for me to comment on the circumstances in which bail may have been granted, or refused, in particular cases.Prior to the sixteenth amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses.  The Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the sixteenth amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.The House will be aware that there have been concerns at how, in practice, our bail laws have been operating and these led to the inclusion in the Criminal Justice Act 2007 of a series of new provisions designed to tighten up on the granting of bail.  Those provisions have been in operation for just 12 months and their effectiveness will be reviewed.  In addition I intend to keep all aspects of the operation of our bail law under review to see whether further changes are necessary.While I accept that in the operation of our bail laws due regard must be had to the presumption of innocence, regard must also be had to the need to protect the community.200420052006200715,53118,36222,77224,189
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	323	What exactly is the problem here?  We have had a difficulty with our bail laws for many years and the House has attempted on a number of occasions to address this matter as it gives rise to significant public concern.  We had the 1984 Act and 12 years later we had a bail referendum, following which we had the Bail Act.  In 2006 and 2007 we had further criminal justice Acts.  I have not seen the table the Minister circulated with his reply, but we are dealing with a situation where thousands of crimes are being committed each year by people who, on the occasion of the commission of the crime, are out on bail in respect of other charges.  This cannot be allowed to continue.With reference to the 2007 Act, why has the section dealing with electronic tagging not been brought into force and why is it not being used?  Another section of that Act facilitated the right of the Garda Síochána, on the part of the State, to appeal to the High Court in cases where bail has been granted.  Why has that section not been put into operation?  There are, therefore, three issues with regard to the delay involved in proceeding to criminal trials, namely, the failure to operate the two sections of the 2007 Act which were designed to alleviate the bail problem and the matter of the delay.  Bail is an important issue that we have been grappling with for decades, yet thousands of crimes are being committed each year by people who are out on bail and who, dare I say it, have an incentive to commit another crime given that they are already facing charges, some of which are of a very serious nature.

The Deputy is correct in saying the Oireachtas has grappled with the issue and put it to the people on at least one occasion in a referendum.  We will, possibly, have to return to a referendum on the issue in the future.  I intend to keep the situation under review and will not hesitate to bring forward further legislative change if necessary.On the issue of tagging, there is a body of opinion that this may not be the most cost effective way of dealing with the matter and that introducing tagging may allow a situation where even more people would be allowed out on bail, on the basis that it is an alternative to incarcerating people who, under the eyes of the law, are innocent until proven guilty.  It is the effort to achieve the right balance with regard to the taking away of a person's liberty that causes the issue with which the Judiciary must grapple.  On one hand it must consider the right of people who are innocent until proven guilty and on the other the common good to ensure suspects are held in custody rather than given bail.Over the years, the Oireachtas has given a strong signal that the issue must be dealt with firmly and that is the reason we enacted the legislation in 2007.  It has only been in place less than 12 months and must be given the opportunity to bed down.  If we feel that other issues need to be dealt with then, we will deal with them.

From that point of view, proper resourcing of the justice system, the courts, the DPP, the forensic lab and the free legal aid service, in particular, would go a long way.  With that in mind, will the Minister give us an update on the new State forensic lab?  Currently, delays with results from the forensic lab cause huge problems with court cases and on occasion it can take up to 18 months before a case can come to trial.  If someone was denied bail in such a case, the time in custody would be the equivalent of a three-year sentence.

There are issues that could be examined, but in view of the fact that the recent changes brought in by the Oireachtas in 2007 have not had the opportunity to have an effect, it is not necessary to introduce new legislation.  It is only when that legislation has had the opportunity to take effect that we should consider other changes.On the issues raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I suggest he submit a separate question on those issues.

The Garda dog unit also carried out checkpoint duties involving searches of vehicles and other security-related duties.Following the successful evaluation of a pilot scheme to establish a Garda dog unit in the southern region, the Garda Commissioner, on 4 April 2008, approved the permanent establishment of a Garda dog unit in the southern region and thereafter in the other Garda regions.  The preparation of a fully costed business plan in respect of each region is being addressed and, on receipt of financial approval, it is anticipated that a Garda dog unit will be established in the remaining four regions by mid-2009 and will have a selection of drug, explosive and general purpose dogs.In the interim, the Garda dog unit based in the Dublin metropolitan region will continue to perform its national brief and respond to requests for operational assistance throughout the country.

The case for this is overwhelming and must be undertaken.

These projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development and promote civic responsibility.The Garda Commissioner regularly brings forward proposals for the establishment of new Garda youth diversion projects.  The locations for new projects are selected on the basis of factors such as the level of juvenile crime in the area and the number of young people referred to the local juvenile diversion programme.The target envisaged under An Agreed Programme for Government for the number of Garda youth diversion projects is 168 by 2012.  The interim target of 100 projects by the end of 2007 was achieved, with 29 new projects established that year.  The Garda Commissioner indicated that it is anticipated that between 15 and 16 projects will be recommended for establishment each year over the next four years and that applications for 2008 will be forwarded to me later in the year.Additional resources have been allocated to fund the expansion of these projects with funding set at €11.909 million for 2008 out of a total of €120 million allocated under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.

The Garda is strongly committed to the principle and practice of youth diversion projects and believes they provide a diversion from criminal activity.  The scheme has been 17 years in operation with approximately 100 existing projects and 68 more promised in the programme for Government.  Will the Minister agree it is time for a national evaluation of the projects to decide their future direction?  Such an evaluation would allow an assessment of how the projects contribute to improving the quality of life in communities and enhance Garda-community relations.

I know from my experience in the Louth constituency that they are beneficial and get gardaí into areas in which perhaps heretofore they were not able to operate.  It also allows them to gain the confidence of some young people, but not all unfortunately.The national youth justice strategy 2008 to 2010 details the plans for the development of complementary programmes to existing ones.  The first step is to audit the existing programmes to identify gaps in the system.  This will be completed by the end of 2008 when the development of new initiatives will be considered.  I expect the review will examine the overall value of existing projects.  On an anecdotal basis, it is accepted these have been very beneficial.  That the Government has increased the funding is significant.  It is accepted this is a good scheme.

Whereas I concur with the Minister on the value of these schemes, I am aware of areas seeking approval for such schemes but that have been rejected or have not been selected.  Is it not a better use of resources than spending €100,000 per annum to incarcerate a young person in St. Patrick's Institution or elsewhere?  Is it not an area that we might well put investment into in the hope of restricting prison to people who have committed crimes with violence?

#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I want to express my dismay, disgust and disappointment at the failed attempt to rectify a situation in the Kerry North and Kerry South constituencies.  It was evident there was not enough of a population to support the retention of six Deputies in those two constituencies.  Rectifying it should have been a simple matter of reducing the two three-seat constituencies to a single five-seat constituency.  Such a move would have left the good people of west Limerick to keep their Limerick West constituency intact and have their own elected Deputies to make representations for them.  Instead the commission decided otherwise and moved parts of west Limerick into the Kerry North constituency.  Why was the single Kerry constituency option not taken rather than the decimation of the Limerick West constituency?I understand approximately 17,500 people from County Tipperary will be part of the new constituency, Limerick.  I welcome that I will be representing these people.  They are used to good representation from Deputies Jan O'Sullivan, Michael Noonan and Kieran O'Donnell.  They, like the people of west Limerick, who have been lost to north Kerry, are equally mesmerised as to why they have lost their Dáil representatives.  It does not make sense to me.I feel a distinct loyalty to the people of west Limerick who voted for me in serval elections.  I want to assure them I will continue my representations for them.  I will now be representing the good people from the east of the county — Caherconlish, Cappamore, Doon, Murroe and Pallas Green and other towns — and people from County Tipperary.  I will do my very best to maintain the good representation they had.  Since the Constituency Commission reported, we have been already active in this new part of the constituency.I agree with the sensible statement by the Taoiseach before he assumed office that we should no longer leave our livelihoods in the hands of an independent commission.  The House must have an input into deciding the revisions.  While I respect the independence required for the Constituency Commission, in future an interim constituency report should be published and examined.  The House should be allowed to make a political input to it with drastic changes taken out.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I concur with my Limerick colleague, Deputy John Cregan's references to the changes affecting our mutual constituency and to the fact that Limerick will lose a Deputy.  I have some doubts as to the reason for the decision and I agree with Deputy Cregan that it would seem more logical to transform Kerry into a five-seater constituency rather than doing something that will significantly affect the people of County Limerick.I refer to page 23 of the report.  The statistics suggest that Kerry overall was more over-represented than Limerick, with the percentage variance from national average population per Deputy being minus 9.37% in Kerry North, minus 8.13% in Kerry South but minus 7.42% in Limerick East and minus 7.08% in Limerick West.  If I am reading the figures correctly, it appears to suggest that logically it would have been better to reduce the representation in Kerry rather than in Limerick, if the representation was to be reduced.  I do not understand the logic of the report's recommendation and there is nothing in the recommendation that explains the reason for it.  I would have thought that in such situations an explanation should be provided.  There does not seem to be any particular geographical boundaries to suggest the commission decided to basically chop up Limerick West and put part of it into Kerry, take a significant portion of Limerick East and put it into what is now Limerick and take a seat from my own constituency which was Limerick East, a five-seater that is now becoming a four-seater.  There is no logic to it.I draw attention to a debate in the House between the current Taoiseach and our party leader, Deputy Gilmore, when the Taoiseach who was Tánaiste at the time specifically said that this was in our hands.  This is also clear from a reading of the document as it states:The final determination of the constituencies for Dáil Éireann is a matter for the Oireachtas to prescribe in legislation.  The Commission's role is advisory.The Supreme Court judgment quoted in the report refers to Article 16.2.3° of the Constitution:The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.I would have thought that, where possible, they would go as close as they could to reflecting the population.  In this case, the decision to take the seat from Limerick does not appear to do this; it goes against the guidelines of the commission and I question the decision.I presume the commission did not intend to split boundaries if at all possible but it has been done in this case.  I also refer to the contribution of Deputy Kennedy who was vehemently opposed to what is happening in his area of the country.  He suggested that this should be referred back to the commission for consideration in light of today's debate and this is a sensible proposal with which I concur.Overall, there is distinct dissatisfaction with the recommendations in a number of constituencies.  It relates in the main to the breaching of county boundaries without reference to the loyalties that exist.  Deputy Cregan described his loyalty to the people who voted for him up to this and I have a similar issue with regard to areas such as Doon, Cappamore, Caherconlish and Hospital that will now be taken away.  I have visited and met the people on a regular basis in these areas.. They are now gone from our constituency and will have to deal with a new set of public representatives.  Where possible, large sections of population such as these should not have to move to another constituency.  Ultimately, the important people to be considered are not public representatives, but the people themselves.In the case of the changes in Limerick, a large section of the population of County Limerick — practically all of the county part of Limerick — is affected.  The west Limerick people are going into Kerry and the east Limerick people are going into what is now Limerick.  They comprise a large section of the County Limerick population and it will be a significant change for them.  I question whether the turn-out in these constituencies will be up to the same level it has been up to now.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I welcome the Constituency Commission report and congratulate the six members of the commission: Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill; our distinguished Clerk of the Dáil, Mr. Kieran Coughlan; our distinguished Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Deirdre Lane; our distinguished Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly; Ms Geraldine Tallon, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and the former Secretary General, Mr. Niall Callan.  They have produced an excellent report.  I note they asked for widespread consultation from the public and they received more than 300 submissions, including a lengthy submission I made on behalf of the Dublin North-East constituency.Article 16.2.2° states:The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.The desire is to maintain continuity in the arrangements of constituencies and, in general, the commission has carried out that task very well and deserves commendation.  I am aware, as my colleague stated, of instances where traditional boundaries have been breached but the overall constitutional remit of the commission has been carried out well.It would be a bad precedent if we were to dismantle this commission report and return to the days when politicians with vested interests decided in a committee how the Dáil constituencies would be revised.  This would be a bad step backwards and would lead to the charge of gerrymandering, as was the case in the mid-1970s, for a particular election result.  We should accept the commission report.In my submission on behalf of Dublin North-East I made the case that we are an historic constituency going back to the mid-1930s, representing a wide district of the north-east city, from Coolock across to Howth, with very strong economic, community, administrative and cultural ties all across that area.  Many of our community and administrative bodies, such as Northside Partnership, Coolock Development Council and others such as the Northside Centre for the Unemployed, operate across the territory.  I note the sporting and cultural areas of the constituency.The issue of breaching county boundaries was put to the commission by a lecturer from NUI, Maynooth.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, will be interested to hear that he wanted to abolish Dublin Central and to bring about new central constituencies for the northside and southside.  He did not seem to realise or else was not aware of the strong cultural affinities of the northside of Dublin with Dublin Central constituency as it now exists.  Dublin North-East represents two counties, Dublin city and Fingal, but is a region in the cultural, economic and social sense.  It would be a backward step to do away with the current configuration.The main case I made for maintaining Dublin North-East and, with it, Dublin North-West, Dublin North-Central and the Acting Chairman's constituency, Dublin Central — in other words, the current structure of constituencies for the northside of Dublin — was that in my constituency and across the two "county boundaries" we are building a new city, the north fringe.  This is a vast territory of more than 25,000 or perhaps 40,000 housing units with a possible population of 50,000.  I argued strongly to the commission that it was very important that one group of politicians would be responsible for the invigilation of that development.  We did not want two or three constituencies being responsible for an area because then nobody would be responsible.  We wanted the same group of politicians.  Both I and the Labour Party have over the years invigilated the development of the north fringe, which currently stretches from the coast at Baldoyle, through Clongriffin and Beaupark, onto Belmayne and across to Belcamp and Clonshaugh.  We have invigilated a very important development for the city of Dublin.  Even with the negative downturn in population we realise that, because of the north fringe, that area will grow much stronger.  The resulting remit of the constituency of Dublin North-East included Portmarnock, which was brought in.  Deputy Kennedy is particularly upset by the fact that, on the recommendation of this report, Portmarnock is leaving Dublin North and coming into Dublin North-East.  Portmarnock and its surrounding district is extremely welcome in Dublin North-East because we have many cultural ties with it.  The great Northfinch development encompasses Portmarnock, just as it does parts of my constituency.  There are so many bodies, including the Portmarnock-Baldoyle Credit Union, that cross the boundaries.The report should have re-examined the figure of 166 Deputies because there is no question but that Dublin is under-represented by at least two Deputies.  Dublin should have a higher Dáil representation and Dublin North or Dublin West deserved an additional seat.  In general terms, however, I am happy with the report.  We should not spancel an independent commission or return to the bad old days of alleged gerrymandering.

A sea change in representation is not welcome to the people affected.I welcome the speech by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which clearly set out the constitutional and legal framework involved.  I compliment the Constituency Commission on the basis that it has a difficult task of squaring circles.  It is almost a Rubik's cube type of challenge.  I am one of those who made a submission to the commission, although I must say that submissions were demanded very soon after the last general election.  One needed to be reasonably alert to the time limits in order to respond.  It would be better if the deadline came a bit later after a general election.The problem with such a debate in this or the Upper House is that we are effectively commenting on a fait accompli, which means that at best our comments might be taken account of in about five years’ time, if we are lucky.  There is some merit in the suggestion made by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, before he was elected Taoiseach, that a draft report should be published by the commission, perhaps setting out more than one option in some cases, so that the House could comment on the matter.  I would not take the final decision away from the commission, but a draft report would make a debate like this one more useful.The emphasis in the commission's work is on equality and that clearly takes precedence over county boundaries.  I have just been doing duty in the Seanad where a rather different electoral principle applies and which possibly results in areas outside Dublin having, on average, a greater say in who is elected.In the case of County Tipperary, there is a considerable overlap between the county and constituency boundaries.  In other words, a large swathe of South Tipperary County Council's administrative area is in the Tipperary North constituency.  In addition, Tipperary South takes in a bit of west Waterford, while Tipperary North is taking in a bit of north-west Offaly.  There is a certain awkwardness in having a different area of representation — certainly in the country — for county council purposes, with county councillors straddling constituencies, compared to Dáil constituencies.  In my own case, I would naturally prefer that the South Tipperary County Council boundaries would coincide with the constituency ones.  At the same time, however, I have spent much of my life working on cross-Border co-operation and whereas, in theory, such areas could fall between two stools, on the other hand they may benefit from having the support of representatives from both sides of the border, which is a positive aspect.My final point concerns a suggestion that, while not made by the Minister, was made outside the House.  It is the question of whether we should revert to constituencies that are larger than five seats.  For example, Tipperary was once a united county for Dáil purposes and up to the late 1940s it was a seven-seat constituency.  In terms of terrain, however, it would be difficult for a Deputy to represent the whole county.  As things stand, it takes well over an hour to travel from one end of the Tipperary South constituency to the other, and the same applies to Tipperary North.  I would not advocate a single Tipperary constituency.There is also a disadvantage, particularly in rural areas, in having constituencies of more than five seats since it would arguably make more tenuous the close link that exists between Deputies and their constituents.  Obviously, the larger the area, the further one is from one's constituents, unless one divides it up geographically.As regards the number of parties represented in this House, there are more today than on many occasions in the past.  I am not in favour of the electoral system encouraging more fragmentation.Up until the recent past, both Tipperary North and Tipperary South, which are three-seat constituencies, both elected an Independent Deputy.  It is wrong, therefore, to think that three-seaters are incapable of electing Independent Deputies.

At the outset, I wish to compliment the Constituency Commission.  It had a job to do and it did it.  The commission's recommendations do not satisfy everybody, however, which is the reason we are having this debate.  Comments were made in advance of this debate, including by our current Taoiseach who commented on the report in a personal capacity.  He suggested that some type of draft report could be debated here in advance of the commission's final decision.  We should ask to whom we are talking.  Is the commission still in place, or does it no longer exist on the basis that it has completed its report?  I am not sure but perhaps at some stage it can be clarified whether the commission is there, or listing, at this particular time.  Alternatively, are we talking to ourselves regarding this matter?As a Government Deputy for the proposed constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim, my particular interest is that strong representations were made by organisations, political parties and others, recommending that County Leitrim would not be divided.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened.  The outcome of that is that the county of Leitrim does not have a resident TD.  My constituency of Longford-Roscommon includes south Leitrim while Sligo-Leitrim includes north Leitrim.  The people of County Leitrim feel they have not been treated a fair hand of cards in so far as they do not have a resident TD and I can understand that.  The people there have made their position well known.  It is unfortunate that a small county is, to some extent, seen as an area that should not have a TD.  Under the present arrangements, including the recent report, it will be even more difficult for that to happen.I respect the independence of commissions.  It is good that we do not have the gerrymandering we may have had in the past.  It is important that we as public representatives reflect the views expressed in our constituency clinics or wherever.  I hope that somehow or other the wishes of the people of County Leitrim can be addressed in another report or in some other way.I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for sharing time with me.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  As some contributors have said, the change in Limerick is major as it involves 17,000 voters coming in from the former Limerick East and 13,000 going to Kerry North-Limerick West.  The electorate there are extremely concerned and do not understand the reason for such a change.  One can understand small shifts but not such a major transfer.  The electorate in those areas have known their Oireachtas representatives, particularly TDs, for a long period.  While there have been changes from time to time, it has been a change of one TD, but in this case there is a change in representation for a population of 30,000, which is a step too far.I have visited the new area extensively since the change was made and have been warmly welcomed.  I look forward to the challenge of representing those people and I air their concerns in regard to the changes taking place and the lack of connectivity which develops with years of public representation.  The large geographical area of Murroe, Doon, Cappamore, Palace Green, Oola, Hospital and other areas is involved also.  The people who will transfer to the new constituency of Kerry North-Limerick West are angry at being removed from their own county.  At least the area that is coming in from the east remains in Limerick while whole areas are being transferred to the centre of the constituency, which is Tralee.  Areas that we represented very strongly and are geographically near me, such as Ardagh, Athea, Glin, Abbeyfeale, Monogay, Mount Collins and Templeglantine, have been part of Limerick West since 1948 and were part of Limerick prior to the foundation of the State in 1922.While we look forward to the challenge, we do not understand how this happened.  Obviously there was a choice.  It was expected that a few parishes of Kerry North would be moved to Limerick West to make up the balance and that the changes would be minimal.  We have had the experience in Mayo where two constituencies were amalgamated and the number of seats was reduced from six to five.  There was an expectation that something similar would happen in Kerry, where Kerry North and Kerry South would be amalgamated into a five-seater constituency and thus there would be minimal changes in Limerick West and Limerick East.  It is difficult to understand why such a change was made.  There is no logic to it and the new constituency of the city, which effectively made up the majority of the previous Limerick East constituency, will lose a seat.  When Fine Gael and Labour have the majority there, the last seat always goes to Fine Gael, but that seat has now been removed from the equation.  The electorate of 30,000 may not vote as a protest, but I urge every one of those people to cast their votes and ensure that democracy survives as strongly as it always has done in that area.

I hate to think what has been cooked underneath the counter.  I am sure the Acting Chairman has a passing interest in these matters, especially if it should transpire that any constituency would be seriously and materially affected in anything that might be suggested from here on.  I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has the interests of all Members at heart and would not contemplate anything that would militate against the political adventures of the various political groups in the future.I do not agree with the notion that we should politicise the system as it opens the door to allegations of cronyism, favouritism and all kinds of "isms".  A few issues need to be borne in mind.  There is merit in what a number of speakers have said.  Local areas, local towns and local communities resent very much when their local community is broken up by way of an electoral boundary.  For example, if one side of the road is in one constituency and the other side of the road is in another constituency it does not make for good relations or a good turnout at the polls, even on referendum days.  That is an issue that needs to be borne in mind.On this occasion Kildare North received some extra territory from Kildare South.  Care should be taken to ensure boundaries remain for as long as possible.  If electors are transferred from one constituency to another between every second or third election, they become disaffiliated, for want of a better description, and withdraw from the political arena due to a lack of interest.  One interesting case arose in my constituency of Kildare North following the revisions made by the previous Constituency Commission.  The village of Killina could not be approached from any other area of north Kildare without travelling into a different constituency and became, to all intents and purposes, an island.  John Donne once said no man is an island but some of the things that have come to pass make me believe the contrary.  The time available to me is short.

I am deeply suspicious when a debate of this nature is ordered in the House because if it is a case of uisce faoi thalamh, it is dangerous.  One never knows when there will be a burst resulting in a flood.  If something akin to uisce faoi thalamh is pending, I hope the whole place will not be flooded.  I hope it is not intended to re-politicise the drawing of constituency boundaries.  Notwithstanding the possibility that political influence may have been at work in some of the stranger decisions taken from time to time, the current approach is the fairest because it has stood the test of time and removed grounds for suggesting political chicanery has played a role.  I remember the case of the poor late Minister, Jimmy Tully, in 1973 or thereabouts when the Fianna Fáil Party argued that changes in electoral boundaries guaranteed he would win ten elections.  As we later discovered, this was not the case.  I do not believe maintaining his seat was the purpose of the exercise.  Rather, the Minister, Mr. Tully, sought to keep communities together.  From a positive point of view, we should not worry because Governments change.

It recommends transferring a further 6,776 people, the electorate of the areas of Kells urban, Kells rural and Stahalmog, from the constituency of Meath West to Meath East.  County town and parish boundaries have been disregarded and, under the proposals, Kells town and its natural hinterland are to be in separate constituencies.  Kells is a rural town with close links to the surrounding villages and smaller towns of north Meath.  The future economic well-being of the greater Kells area would be best served by keeping the entire area in one Dáil constituency.Like Deputy Durkan, I recall 1973 when part of north Meath was transferred into the constituency of Cavan.

#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The population of the area in question elected to the House the late John P. Wilson, a former Minister and Tánaiste and a great man.  Another part of north Meath was transferred into the constituency of Monaghan.  After some time, however, both areas returned to the Meath constituency.  My party colleague, former Deputy Michael Lynch, and former Fine Gael Party Deputy, Mr. John B. Farrelly, were elected and lost their seats in the area on different occasions.Prior to the 2007 elections, County Meath was divided again when the constituencies of Meath West and Meath East were established.  Unfortunately, I lost a large part of my constituency in Slane, Navan and, in the case of Kells, an area extending from Moynalty to Carlanstown, to my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne.  This change affected parish boundaries and will be repeated if the proposal in the latest review to transfer three quarters of my parish of Kells to Meath East proceeds.  Part of the parishes of Carlanstown and Carnaross were transferred to Meath East under the previous boundary changes.  It is unfair to split parishes in two and I hope the proposed changes will not proceed prior to the next general election.I thank the people of Kells and Stahalmog.  I have represented the town of Kells and its rural hinterland for 34 years.  The electorate of the area do not want to lose a Deputy or councillor who has served them for such a long time.  The Kells area has been affected most by the decision to divide the county into two constituencies.  Someone working for me one day may work for Deputy Thomas Byrne on another day.  Deputies English and McEntee must contend with the same unfairness.I note in respect of the Meath and Louth constituencies that the commission "recommends" extending the Louth constituency by moving the Meath East environs of Drogheda into the electoral constituency of Louth.  The report also highlights the need for a transfer of population from Meath West to Meath East.  I note the Constituency Commission does not make a recommendation in this regard but instead proposes the transfer of a population of 6,776 in the Ceanannas Mór area from Meath West to Meath East.  If the rapid population growth in both Meath West and Meath East continues at the rates indicated in the latest census, further changes will be required in the next constituency review.  In consideration of this and based on the differences in language, the commission's proposal as opposed to recommendation to move Kells from Meath West to Meath East does not require implementation.The report's recommendations are inconsistent, confusing, unprecedented and do not take into account the preservation of natural communities.  While I fully recognise that the Constituency Commission is an independent body, its independence does not confer on it the status of infallibility.  Recommendations made from a mathematical perspective with no consideration for the democratic rights of local communities are wrong.  Fragmentation of closely knit communities across north Meath threatens the co-ordination of future growth in the area.The Electoral Act 1997 states that each constituency "shall be composed of contiguous areas" and "there shall be regard to geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency".  Surely people in north Meath should not be disenfranchised because of the density of population in towns such as Ratoath, Dunboyne and Ashbourne.  I do not understand the reason the Constituency Commission chose not to consider moving those areas to Dublin constituencies such as Dublin West and Dublin North with which they are more aligned, rather than depriving people in parts of north Meath of a Deputy who has served them for 34 years.  It is very unfair.  I cannot understand why they never looked at those areas.Section 6(f) also states that subject to the provisions of the section, the commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies.  The Electoral Act 1997 also recommends that the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable.  The report on local electoral boundaries will be published next month and this will undoubtedly add more confusion for voters.On behalf of the people I have represented in this House for 11 years, I earnestly request that the recommendations of the commission be rejected.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	359	In a number of cases this report ignores the spirit and intent of section 6(2)(c) of the Electoral Act 1997, which states that “the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable”.  That has happened in my constituency of Kerry North and in Limerick West, and in Counties Tipperary, Offaly, Louth, Meath and Leitrim.  This could have been avoided.  The changes diminish the level of representation of the people living in the constituencies concerned.In my constituency, I feel strongly the integrity of Kerry North ought to have been retained, as well as that of Limerick West.  Indeed there are far stronger feelings about this in the parts of County Limerick that are affected, given that there is a good chance that nobody from that part of the constituency might be elected as part of the new arrangement.  There are those who will argue this is not important and that people still get to vote for the party of their choice, but that is to underestimate the importance of local identity and the fact that the people best able to represent individuals and communities from distinct areas are people who are from those areas and living there.  Local knowledge and local interaction are of great benefit to those who are elected as it gives them a better connection to their constituents.The transfer of the Kerry North districts of Deelis, Kilgobban, Knockglass, Baurtregaum, Kilfelim and Castleisland to Kerry South distorts what has been the traditional integrity of the constituency and the patterns of local representation.  I also argue on the grounds of local community and integrity that the Dingle Peninsula should be considered more naturally a part of Kerry North and incorporated as such.  It would certainly make more sense than including parts of County Limerick.  Parts of the west Kerry Peninsula were incorporated into Kerry North for the 2007 election.  These include Camp, Aughacasla and Derrymore.  In the past, the Dingle Peninsula was also part of Kerry North.  It made for better representation because of the geographical position and because of closer proximity to the elected representatives.Similar strong feelings exist in those parts of south Offaly transferred to Tipperary North, as they do in north Meath and especially in Leitrim, as that county has been divided between the two new constituencies of Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim.  People from outside of the county may feel that this is a trivial matter, but they underestimate the real depth of feeling on this issue and how local people genuinely feel it will further disadvantage them across a range of issues in which they feel the county is already hard done by.  I was in Leitrim recently and it was brought home to me that the people there feel they will not get proper representation if the county is divided.Sinn Féin's opposition to the report goes back to the legislation which established the commission.  We made our feelings known at the time and tabled a number of amendments outlining the direction in which we wished to see constituency organisation develop.  We argued at the time and we still argue that the commission ought to have recommended the creation of larger constituencies, including six and seven-seat constituencies, some of which could indeed encompass entire counties or combinations of entire counties.  We outlined this proposal in our submission to the commission but such changes were not considered.  The commission has in fact gone in the opposite direction by reducing the number of five seat constituencies from 12 to 11.We believe the changes dilute the proportionality of our electoral system and distort the effectiveness of proportional representation.  It also goes against the original spirit and intent of constituency and proportional representation.  In 1922 there were only three three-seat constituencies while there were five constituencies of six, seven and even eight seats.  It should be possible to move in the direction of six and seven-seat constituencies and this would produce a better reflection of the PR system and the preference of voters, especially in light of the much greater diversity of opinion and political representation in recent years.  That is already reflected in this House.Sinn Féin is concerned that the existence of three-seat constituencies in certain areas and five-seat constituencies in other areas creates inequality between voters in different parts of the State.  It is discriminatory in that voters in three-seat constituencies have a lower chance of electing their chosen representative if he or she comes from a smaller party compared with people living in a five-seat constituency.Members should contrast the ability of voters in Finglas and Foxrock to elect their chosen representatives in the Dáil.  The people of Finglas, in the three-seat constituency of Dublin North-West, do not have the same opportunity of putting their chosen party or representatives into Leinster House as the people of Foxrock in the five-seat constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  Is it merely a coincidence that there is a proliferation of three-seat constituencies north of the Liffey, whereas larger constituencies are more common south of the Liffey?Will the people of Leitrim or of the part of Limerick included in the revised Kerry North constituency have any chance of electing a representative of their county to the Dáil in the future?  Is the legislation restricting the size of constituencies to three seats, four seats and five seats a deliberate attempt by the establishment to keep the marginalised in their place?  New developments are springing up all over Dublin and stretching into surrounding counties, so the problem also arises in these areas.  Boundaries may have to be changed every couple of years.  It would make much more sense to have larger multi-seat constituencies that could accommodate such population shifts, without having to change the electoral boundaries constantly.  That is the reason for our idea of six-seat and seven-seat constituencies.The commission was constrained by statute and constituency sizes were restricted to between three and five seats.  That meant it could never address some of the issues to which I have referred.  The proportionality that is possible under the PRSTV system in this State has been substantially diluted through the selective redrawing of constituency boundaries and the reduction in constituency size from five to three seats.  Proportional representation with a single transferable vote, or PRSTV, using multi-seat constituencies is a unique system that is hardly practised outside Ireland.  It is not designed with the intention of being applied to three-seat constituencies.  The number of members returned per constituency is a crucial component of the Irish electoral system.  The higher the number of Members returned per constituency, the greater the proportionality of the system.I reiterate the disappointment of my party and many others with the report.  I emphasise the criticism of its remit from the time it began its work.  Those criticisms stand and will remain relevant because we believe the flaws contained in it and the lack of scope for more radical change will continue to be exposed.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Devins.  As Deputy Brady has outlined, this report has had a serious effect on the county and the constituencies of Meath East and Meath West.  The last review, which people still talk about, was particularly devastating for the people of north Meath when most of the parishes of Kilbeg, Kilmainhamwood, Moynalty, Nobber and Drumconrath were transferred into Meath East.  Thanks to Deputy Brady's support, I was elected to the House by the votes of people from that area.  I am grateful to Deputy Brady and the people of the beautiful area for that.The Constituency Commission has an important and difficult job to do.  Deputies should not complain too much because it is a privilege to be elected to the House from any constituency.  Perhaps the terms of reference under which the commission operates should be slightly stricter and further terms should be added.  This is particularly true of County Meath, as referred to by Deputy Brady.  There are several parishes, from Kilbeg parish to Summerhill, that are split between the two constituencies.  A number of submissions were made by independent people to the commission, suggesting that these parishes be united and included in Meath East.  Having done that, the town of Kells, including the district electoral divisors of Kells, Maperath and Staholmog, would not have to be moved into Meath West.  The unity of the parish boundary would then have been recognised by the commission, a factor that is not in its terms of reference but should be included.  Parishes in rural Ireland are the centre of activity, through the church, football teams and schools.  Deputy Brady and I represent Kilberry, Oristown, Kilbeg, Moynalty, Johnstown parishes and the Navan area, which are split between Meath East and Meath West, so we co-operate on issues in those areas.  It would be far better for the people if they had one set of representatives rather than two.  We find ourselves tripping over each other.Tá mé ag smaoineamh freisin faoi cheantair Gaeltachta ar nós Baile Ghib.  Tá cuid den cheantar sin i nDáilcheantar an Mhí Thiar, ach tá an chuid is mó de i nDáilcheantar an Mhí Thoir.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr do muintir na háite sin dá mbeidís sa Dháilcheantar chéanna.  The importance of the parish boundary should be recognised by the commission.The importance of the county boundary should also be recognised.  Some 17,000 people are moving from a constituency in County Meath to one in County Louth for electoral purposes.  The people in the area are not happy because they identify with County Meath, not County Louth.  There is a strong rivalry with Louth.  More important, the area of Meath East that has been moved, where I live, is a particularly needy area because of the massive increase in development over the past ten years.  The population has more than doubled in some parts and these people will be moved into Louth, where they will be a marginal feature of the Louth constituency.  It will be difficult to elect a candidate from that area and those who put their trust in me delivering facilities and building community spirit, which is happening slowly but surely, will be seriously disadvantaged at a national level.  In that case the commission should have adhered to the terms of reference in so far as it could and respected the county boundary line.  It was a bad decision although I understand the difficulties the commission has in balancing numbers.  However, it did not think of adding to the number of Deputies in the House, which it could have done without much controversy.  That might have solved some problems.The last Deputy resident in Meath East was the late Mr. Jimmy Tully.  I do not anticipate reverting to that situation, where politicians are too smart.  Determining constituency boundaries is a difficult job and one that politicians cannot dictate.  It backfired in the case of Jimmy Tully but also elsewhere, even on our side.  I advocate an independent commission but one that considers county boundaries, parish boundaries and the needs of new areas.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien may refer to Swords, which is in a similar position to Meath East in that it is a growing area.  It needs to be represented by the same set of representatives who can plead the case.  The Louth Deputies will not focus on Meath East and its particular needs.We should not complain too much because we are in a privileged position.  I am grateful to the people of Meath East, most of which was new to me at the last general election, as were the people.  I was new to them and with the help of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, Deputy Brady and Deputy Wallace, I got to know the area and the people got to know me and put their trust in me.  I agree with Deputy Brady that this issue must be re-examined independently.

The Constituency Commission is independent and, with the history of gerrymandering that went on in this country, it is vitally important that it remains so.  At the same time, some anomalies have arisen.I refer to the north west and particularly Sligo-North Leitrim.  When I was first elected to the House, the constituency was Sligo-Leitrim, a four-seater that had consistently returned a Deputy from Leitrim.  In the 2007 election County Leitrim was divided into Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim.  Arising from the 2007 election, no Deputy based in Leitrim was elected.  Since then many Leitrim people have made representations to me about the lack of a Leitrim-based Deputy.  The integrity of county boundaries should be a priority for the Constituency Commission and I ask that, in any future electoral revisions, due consideration be given to maintaining the integrity of county boundaries.  It is an honour to serve the people of Sligo-North Leitrim but, having said that, as the smallest county in Ireland Leitrim should have the ability to elect a Deputy based in the county.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I propose to share time with Deputy Charles Flanagan.  The Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, expressed his concerns about the constituency boundaries.  I would be concerned at political interference in this issue and I hope this is not another aspect of the dictatorial ethos we see from the Government.There is an issue of county boundaries, to which many speakers referred.  Avoidance of breaching county boundaries is part of the terms of reference.  The document published on county boundaries last year increased the number of county boundary breaches by three rather than reducing it, in Kerry-North Limerick, Louth-Meath and Offaly-North Tipperary.  That which has got the most publicity was the division of County Leitrim and the creation of my constituency, Roscommon-South Leitrim, and Sligo-North Leitrim.  Specific provision must be made in the terms of reference for small counties such as Leitrim.  There must be division in larger counties such as Meath, Cork and Tipperary because it is logistically impossible to have constituencies that big.  It is important for a small county like Leitrim that county boundaries are sacrosanct.  The report before us should be returned to the commission requesting that it amend its terms of reference to provide that the boundaries of counties with a population of fewer than 50,000 or 60,000 remain intact.  It is possible to create constituencies that remain within the thresholds set out in the Constitution.I was the only Deputy from my constituency who made a submission to the Constituency Commission.  I made a detailed submission outlining how County Leitrim could be retained in one constituency while ensuring proper representation throughout the province of Connaught.  My point was that County Roscommon should remain intact as should County Leitrim and that a new three seat constituency of Roscommon-East Galway be established with two further four seater constituencies in Galway.There has been a long association between Roscommon and Galway East with one constituency crossing the River Suck on a number of occasions in the past.  There is a great deal of co-operation across the county boundary.  For example, many people in north-east Galway have a strong affinity with public representatives in County Roscommon.  I deal with these people on a weekly basis and have no difficulty doing so.  There are also many economic ties between Roscommon and Galway East.  The Constituency Commission could have addressed this issue by looking at it from this particular perspective.I urge the Government to review this matter with a view to amending the terms of reference to provide that the county boundaries of counties with a population of under 60,000 be sacrosanct.  It is feasible to do this.  In the past, we had crazy constituencies as a result of political decisions.  When former Deputy Jack McQuillan was a Member of this House, County Roscommon was divided into five separate constituencies.  We do not want this to happen again in the future.  It would be easy to address the concerns that have been raised by amending the proposals given to the commission in the first instance.

I rise merely to speak as a representative of one of the constituencies it appears will be adversely affected by the proposed changes.I wonder about the purpose of this debate.  What credence or weight can be placed on our making statements here today?  I hope the Minister when replying will enlighten us as to the object of today's exercise.  I would like to know what the Government is doing in this regard and what is its intention regarding this report.  Is it being accepted, accepted with qualification or rejected?  It is important we have leadership in this regard.  Those who can provide that element of leadership are sitting opposite.My own constituency will lose thousands of voters to Tipperary North.  This is the only time in the history of this State that the constituency of Laois-Offaly has been in any way affected by boundary changes.  It is, in fact, the only constituency in the entire country that has never been affected by any reviews or changes since the foundation of the State.  From that point of view, this change is a major one for the midlands.The Constituency Commission has decided to butcher and fragment the constituency of Laois-Offaly for the first time ever.  Part of the county of Offaly is to be joined with Tipperary North.  I do not mean any disrespect to the people of north Tipperary but the fact remains that not only are different counties involved, so too are different provinces.  There is nothing in terms of affinity, relationship, close or otherwise, between the people of Offaly and the people of Tipperary.

Let us examine for a moment what will happen in respect of Garda divisions.  It is proposed that Garda divisions be changed to accord with county boundaries, yet we are splitting County Offaly.  In regard to court districts, County Offaly is in the midlands circuit which extends from Sligo to south Laois.  It is now proposed that part of County Offaly be joined with Tipperary.  The old health board district and HSE midlands incorporates the natural midlands counties of Westmeath, Longford, Offaly and Laois.  It is totally unacceptable that part of the county of Offaly should now, for electoral purposes, be placed in a different province.Much has been said about the democratic deficit or the gap between local politicals and euro politics.  Yet, European parliamentarians for south Offaly will be from the Leinster area and its Dáil representatives will be from Tipperary North which is located in a different province.  The local government conflict is quite obvious.  Tullamore will be the local administrative centre and whereas Birr was the market town for south Offaly for many years the main focus of attention now politically will be Thurles which is many miles away.  The only time people from Offaly go to Thurles is for hurling.  It is extraordinary that the people of County Offaly should be centred politically in an area which is somewhat alien to them.If one is looking to natural county boundaries and constituencies it is totally unnatural then that there are two three-seat constituencies in Tipperary.  Why is this?  Why are there two constituencies in County Tipperary?  Changes on the basis of population structure of an area would cause far less anxiety, anger and disharmony than does the bolstering up of the entirely artificial constituency of Tipperary North thus ensuring it remains an entity by adding to it a portion of County Offaly.The democratic will of the people has been removed.  The people of south Offaly are against this move.  What local needs basis is undertaken by the electoral boundaries?  There has been no consultation by the commission with stakeholders.  In considering a change in the terms of reference we should bear in mind local area needs.  I am concerned about the Taoiseach's statement this morning on the Order of Business when he said that he was in some way unhappy with what happened to our respective constituents in Laois-Offaly and indicated that it is an issue that could be examined.  I would like if that matter could be clarified by the Taoiseach.The overriding point is that for electoral purposes we are moving people from Offaly to the province of Munster.  For example, in regard to the areas for designated euro status, Laois-Offaly is located in the Border, midlands and western region.  Part of this constituency is now being moved to another area.  If the Laois-Offaly constituency is to be changed consideration might be given to changing the eastern side of the constituency where there has been a considerable shift in population.  Areas such as Carlow-Kilkenny, Offaly-Kildare or Laois-Carlow in which there would be more of a natural affinity in terms of business and interaction could be considered rather than placing people in a different province, an area in which there has been no traditional association.I merely express my utmost concern at what is happening.  Also, I wonder about the point of this exercise today and hope that the Minister when replying will inform us as to what will be the next move.

I believe even the most eminent can make mistakes.  This report contains glaring errors and inconsistencies.  I listened with interest in the Chamber today and on the monitor in my office to the contributions made by Deputies Thomas Byrne, John Cregan and Charles Flanagan.  Some of the recommendations in respect of many of the constituencies across the country do not make sense to me.  It is a great honour to be a Member of the House and the constituents who elected us a short 12 months ago have been raising with their TDs and with Senators the grave concerns they have about this report and the feeling they could be disenfranchised and have their representation reduced.Although I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Constituency Commission report I must admit I would rather not because if I did not have to speak on it I would not have to address the issues which the report has raised.  On my first reading of the report I was astonished to see some of the recommendations made for my constituency of Dublin North.  The findings of the report mean that more than 21,000 voters will be transferred not to one constituency but to two, namely Dublin North-East and Dublin West.  I see Deputy Varadkar walking in so I will make a clear case as to why Swords should not go to Dublin West.These proposed changes are made without any regard to historical boundaries, contiguous areas or geography.  It is my clear view the commission took the easy way out in dealing with Dublin North.  It was obvious to everyone that the population of my constituency as per the 2006 census meant an extra seat should have been added and that the constituency should have become a five seat constituency.  I state this without any personal or political gain in mind.  All four TDs elected last year will be equally affected by these findings.  No political party will benefit over another or be disadvantaged more than any other.This report, if implemented, will weaken the representation of the people of Dublin North.  I have had literally hundreds of complaints from concerned constituents of all party allegiances and none with regard to the effective partitioning of Dublin North, in particular the capital town of Fingal, namely, Swords, which I will put in an historical context.  For centuries, Swords has been the capital town of Fingal.  It has seen many changes over hundreds of years but none as drastic as this.  It was one of the original settlements of St. Colmcille and received the slain body of the high king of Ireland, Brian Boru, who was the first O'Brien and it is important that I am speaking on his behalf.  He and his son Murragh were laid out in the church in Swords after the battle of Clontarf.

People do see themselves in the main as Dubs but also as Fingalians.  Swords is the capital of Fingal from where Fingal County Council operates.  The findings of the commission's report with the stroke of a pen transfers 13,000 voters from Swords to Dublin West.  The entire River Valley and Forest Road area of Swords, which represents 40% of the voting population of 34,000, will be removed from its rightful constituency to one which has no connection to the town.  No right-minded person could make sense of this recommendation.The Electoral Act 1997 states "each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas" and "there shall be regard to geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and the density of population in each constituency".  This report in no way takes into account contiguous areas.  The 13,000 voters from Swords proposed to be transferred to Dublin West are a full 10 km from the nearest major town in Dublin West, namely, Mulhuddart.The people of Swords are genuinely devastated by this report.  I have not known any previous report to have had such an effect on the area or to get people so charged about an issue.  People are genuinely concerned that they will lose the effective representation that all four TDs, including myself, offer to Dublin North and the town of Swords.  This is no reflection on the TDs in Dublin West, including Deputies Joan Burton and Leo Varadkar.  It merely states the reality.The town of Swords has one local electoral boundary.  It is one electoral area for local elections.  Splitting the area in two disenfranchises and weakens the chances of local politicians and councillors of ever running in a general election.  If a county councillor represents both sides of the Swords area to the best of his or her ability he or she will lose out on a large portion of what is his or her strongest voting block for the general election.  Local councillors from other areas throughout the constituency will have a distinct advantage over Swords councillors as their entire electoral areas will remain intact, which is not the case in the Malahide ward.  These are the thoughts of the Swords Electoral Boundary Action Group which has done a great deal of work and made a welcome submission to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which was well put together.  I hope it is taken into account.  No other town in my constituency is split in this way.The commission states the population is being moved to support the four seat constituency of Dublin West.  However, it will also deny the people of Dublin North the five seat constituency they should have.  In development plans, the population of Swords is projected to grow to 100,000 people.  How will we deal with this being split over two Dáil constituencies?  It is highly likely that Dublin West will have ample population in the next census to be a four seat constituency and that the area of Swords to which I refer will move back to Dublin North.  To propose such drastic changes and implement them for a five year period makes absolutely no sense to me and my constituents.In Portmarnock, Balgriffin and parts of Baskin in the southern end of my constituency, 9,000 voters will be moved to Dublin North-East to effectively prop up a three seat constituency.  Portmarnock is a sister town of Malahide and is part of the Malahide electoral ward within Fingal.  It will be thrown in with areas of the city council.  We will have two sets of councillors from two local authorities in two Dáil constituencies trying to represent the areas of Portmarnock and Balgriffin.  The feeling of disenfranchisement in Portmarnock is palpable.  Only last week, I met residents who were dismayed at the prospect of being lumped into another constituency with which they have no connection.  My colleague in the council, Councillor Eoghan O'Brien, will represent a ward where one third is in the constituency of Dublin North-East and where part of the constituency is in Dublin City Council.It would have been more logical for the commission to have proposed that Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central be merged to create a five seat constituency and Dublin North should have gained a seat and become a five seat constituency.  At the time of the most recent election, Dublin North had a population which would have required a five seat constituency.  It could be argued that we are already under-represented.  If implemented, I see these changes as temporary and this area reverting to Dublin North in five years time.The process is flawed and boundary changes are made without due attention to population projections.  All parties should insist the commission's report is re-examined prior to its implementation.  Many of my colleagues from throughout the country have already made cases as to why proposed changes make no sense in their areas.  We are the legislators and we should not be afraid to state when a report's findings are plainly incorrect and of no benefit to the people who really matter, namely, the citizens.  If this report is accepted, which I expect it will be, we must ensure future reports are not accepted by the Department until they are debated.  It is hoped the members of the permanent electoral commission, which will take over this function for future elections, will bear the needs of the citizen at the forefront of their minds.

I only regret we are not here to implement the legislation changing the constituency boundaries.  In all my time in the House, I have never heard such self-serving speeches, particularly from the Government side and including Ministers.  I put it down to the signal the Taoiseach sent out when he was Minister for Finance about seeking the agreement of all parties to changing the boundary commission.  It is all well and good to bring forward legislation but I do not know how people will sit on an independent commission if all we do is say, "They are independent but...".  We either accept the report or we do not.  I fully accept it and I compliment those involved on their work.  I challenge Members who contributed earlier to produce a constituency breakdown that is fairer.

Section 6 of the Electoral Act provides that the commission, when examining boundary changes, should ensure the number of Members of the Dáil shall not be fewer than 164 and not more than 168.  According to the last census, the population is 4,000,239.  If the current rate of population increase continues, the legislation will have to be amended to increase the number of Members within the next ten years or a constitutional referendum will need to be held.  There is neither the political will nor public support to increase the number of Members.  If anything, the public would like to reduce the number of Members radically but I will not go down that road.  However, a constitutional referendum will be necessary to increase the upper limit of representation from 30,000 people.  An electoral commission should be set up to examine that issue.Such a commission should also examine Article 16.2.3°, which refers to the ratio of Members to population in that it should be equitable in so far as is practicable.  A court judgment in this regard stated a balance should be struck within plus or minus 10%.  That is all well and good but, based on demographics over the past few decades, the population has moved significantly towards the east coast and this geographic imbalance will result in the east coast having significant representation in the Dáil.  I tried to articulate a view on this a few years ago and it was misinterpreted.  I was depicted as being in favour of two rural Deputies for every urban Deputy.  However, this issue must be examined in order that counties such as Kerry, Mayo and Donegal are not denuded of representation, resulting in a huge geographic imbalance.Where parts of counties have been lost to other counties, their names should be included in the constituency title.  For example, parts of Offaly were lost to County Tipperary.  The commission should examine proposals for multi-seat and single seat constituencies, as enunciated by Deputy Dempsey previously, the spend between elections and the life span of Ministers.  A number of Ministers have grown old.  Deputy Dempsey will say it is better to grow old in office than in Opposition but I have concerns about a Minister serving for 15 or 20 years, given the workload involved.  We have ample evidence in recent years of them becoming stale.  Deputies Scanlon and Nolan should be given an opportunity to sit in Cabinet or my colleagues in opposition should be given an opportunity to do the job.

There is a case for term limits, although I reserve the right to change my position on that as I get older.  Fine Gael's legal advice is the report has been made.  I dislike intensely significant aspects of it.  The wrong decisions were made in several cases but it would be wrong of us, as politicians, to amend the report.  If we were to do that, it would have knock-on effects elsewhere.  We  have experienced the consequences of gerrymandering in the past and I do not favour us wielding the axe on a report such as this, although I hope the issue can be reviewed.  I also hope the House adopts the report.  If an election was called using the existing boundaries, it would probably have constitutional effect.  We should adopt the report, as published, but an instruction should immediately be given to the boundary commission to resume its deliberations and to examine issues such as the partitioning of towns and counties unnecessarily.I refer, in particular, to Swords where 12,768 citizens were transferred from the Dublin North constituency to my constituency, Dublin West.  They are separated by ten miles from the Blanchardstown-Castleknock area I represent, which is a distinct entity bounded by the River Liffey to the south, the Phoenix Park to the east and the Meath border to the west.  There is a ten-mile green belt between Blanchardstown and Swords.  Drawing a boundary down the main street of Swords was against everyone's interest and particularly those who live in the town.  They will not receive the representation they deserve or that they would have received from the politicians who knew them and who live in the town.  This division could have been addressed in another way.Dublin West is still under represented by 3.43% while Dublin North is also slightly under represented by 3.74%.  It would have been possible to transfer at least 11,000 people into Dublin North while maintaining both constituencies as four-seaters.  That would have resulted in a variation of plus 8% in Dublin North and a corresponding variation of minus 8% in Dublin West, which is consistent with the variation permitted in Mayo East by the boundary commission in 1983, which provided for a variation of 7.89%.Every public representative in Dublin North and Dublin West does not want Swords to be partitioned.  There is probably an all-party consensus that both constituencies should be at the top and bottom end of over and under representation to facilitate the wishes of the people of Swords.  However, I accept the reasons that cannot be done and the potential knock-on effects for other areas with a number of constituencies being opened up to changes that may not be supported on an all-party basis.  However, if the report is adopted by the House and an election occurs in the meantime, the House should ask the boundary commission to immediately re-examine the boundaries and to produce an alternative set of proposals regardless of what may happen as a consequence of the 2011 census.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I do not agree with Deputy Timmins very often but he made some valid arguments.  We should examine a number of broader issues such as the number of seats in the House and difference in representation between urban and rural areas.  If there is a problem in rural Ireland, we should be conscious of it and that is why it is important, in planning the economic development of the country, to take that on board.  Many parts of the east coast are congested and there are major issues.  We must be more radical and we must think outside the box when it comes to these issues.I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the report, which deals with Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  It is an important report, as it allows us all to debate, examine and propose constructive ideas on democracy, our national Parliament and the European Parliament.  I am part of a three seat constituency and it is important that we look seriously at this issue.  Dublin North-Central used to be a four seat constituency but was trimmed down to a three-seater.  Due to population numbers, it is still a three-seater with a bit extra coming from Edenmore and Raheny, Dublin 5.  I welcome the people of Edenmore back into Dublin North-Central and will do my best to support and assist them in all their local issues.My personal position is that three seat constituencies are not necessarily good for our voters, our citizens and democracy.  We need more four or five seat constituencies to include a broad range of views and to reflect modern Ireland.  This is the way forward.  We need to change and be open to change to help our voters.  This is a very important aspect of this report and an area at which we need to look.The House may remember that before the last general election, the former Independent Deputy, Catherine Murphy, and I took a High Court case dealing with this particular issue and made major progress in respect of Article 16.2.3° of our Constitution.  It is important that we remind ourselves of this article, which requires that, as far as practicable, the ratio of Deputies to the population in each constituency should be the same throughout the country.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas and legislators, must do our best to uphold Article 16.2.3°.Our High Court case triggered a debate which came up with some sensible proposals.  I also welcome the fact that even though we lost the case on a technicality, our costs were covered because the judge felt that we had something very important to say and some constituencies benefited as a result.  It is very important that we look at this aspect.  At no stage should we allow any Minister or anybody else to be in breach of Article 16.2.3° in light of the new figures and census.We must also ensure that the ratio of Members to population in each constituency is fair and democratic.  It is also important for us to protect and vindicate the right to equality of all our citizens.  It is up to every Member of the Oireachtas, regardless of party, to defend the personal rights of all our citizens.  This case demonstrates once again the importance of having people in the Oireachtas, Independent Deputies in particular, to act as watchdogs over the political system to protect the rights of our citizens and taxpayers.There is much talk in this House about social and political inclusion, yet, in the past, there have been clear breaches of Article 16.2.3° of Bunreacht na hÉireann.  It is important that, when we are talking about democracy and political and social inclusion, we ensure that people in the most disadvantaged areas have a genuine reflection of their voice in Dáil Éireann.Recently, I got into trouble in respect of Article 9 of the Constitution.  It is very important that we highlight this issue and the fact that Article 9 is relevant to this debate.  This article states fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all our citizens.  It is important to remind ourselves of Article 9, particularly in this debate, because we all have political duties and a loyalty to the State that we should do our best to implement.  I know many of my colleagues across parties accept and support this position.  It is very important that we are constantly vigilant in this regard.In respect of the European elections, one has the broader debate on the Lisbon treaty and the questions raised about democracy and different aspects of different articles in the treaty.  People have genuine concerns which we should not dismiss.  We should look at the detail and have the debate.  Even if we disagree, we should move on.  Let us end the name calling and get on with it.The Dublin area will lose a seat in the next European elections.  I have concerns about that because we will end up with a three-seat constituency in the Dublin area.  I ask the fundamental question as to whether this is enough to represent the people of Dublin in the European Parliament.  I, and many people throughout the State, have concerns about this issue, which is relevant to this debate.  We need to ensure that we look at the details of the report.I also agree with some of Deputy Cregan's remarks.  He came up with the idea of an interim report, which would allow us to have a broader debate about the constituency issue.  Again, it is important for us to have that opportunity because ensuring that the relevant articles in the Constitution, the broader debate and the report, particularly Article 16.2.3°, are implemented is our bread and butter and that of the citizens of this State.  Deputy O'Brien talked about the ratio of Deputies in respect of Swords.  People in Limerick, Kerry and the west have major concerns also.The elected representatives of this House have legitimate concerns which I share.  Even though Dublin North-Central is a three-seater, it is fairly compact and one can get from one end to the other in ten to 15 minutes.  This helps people to get to know one and their local Deputy.  This business of chopping and changing every couple of years can be very awkward at times.  In 2002, all of Grace Park Road was in Dublin North-Central.  Now one side of the road is in Dublin North-Central while the other is in Dublin North-West.  When very important planning and local issues, such as the Dublin Port tunnel, arise, people are confused at times and are crisscrossing different constituencies.  It leads to confusion so we need some common sense when it comes to drawing boundaries, be they through villages, cities, roads or towns.The same can be said of Griffith Avenue, which is probably one of the nicest avenues in Europe.  It is divided down the middle.  I lost some of it to Dublin North-West, while the rest of it is in Dublin North-Central.  I raise these issues because they are important in the broader debate.  We must ensure that the citizens get a fair crack of the whip in this debate.I commend my former colleague, Catherine Murphy, on the work she did on the High Court case because she did the nation a great service.  Even though she was not re-elected in Kildare, she performed a valuable service for the people nationally and in north Kildare.  It is important that we say that, particularly in respect of service by people who are no longer Members of the Oireachtas.  I urge people to listen to the ideas of different Members of the Oireachtas.  Let us hope that we can all build a more inclusive and democratic country.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I find elements of today's debate rather difficult to understand, particularly the position of Members of Fianna Fáil and supporters of the party like Deputy Finian McGrath.  It is difficult to understand why this particular debate is being rolled out.  I understand that there is cross-party agreement in this House for very good reasons.  Given that the independent commission has put forward its report, as the law and arrangements now stand, the Government of the day has given a clear indication that the report will be implemented and form the basis of the boundaries at the next election.  For that reason, it behoves every Deputy in the House to act with caution in respect of how we deal with the independent commission's report.The Labour Party has put forward proposals for the reform of how the structure works.  We need look no further than the United Kingdom where commission revisions are ongoing on a rolling basis every number of years.  When boundary changes are recommended, it is followed by, in effect, a local inquiry where individuals, groups, public representatives and political parties in the affected areas are, if they are so minded, empowered to make representations or comments on whether the proposal is acceptable and, if not, why not.  The boundary commission is not in any way obliged to accept these, but it does allow a public discussion of the pros and cons of what is being proposed, which is so important, as it is with planning matters.  I would like to see us move to that system.As the Minister pointed out in his speech, of the 43 constituencies in the State, 37 are largely unaffected by the changes proposed in the boundary commission's report.  The vast majority of constituencies remain as they were.  Obviously, then, this debate is of no great interest to the Members representing those constituencies.  However, in the areas where the changes have been, in some cases, enormous, there is a difficulty.  We must be conscious in this House at all times of the potential for democratic deficits where the people of particular areas, regions or counties feel they are being left out, left behind or unfairly treated by the public administration system.I do not know what the Government intends to do.  It is sending out smoke signals that if there is sufficient opposition, particularly from the Opposition, to the independent commission's report, it will either not be implemented or it will only stand for a short period of time and the boundaries will be changed again by the time of the next general election.  The Government must give some indication of what are its serious intentions.  Does it intend to accept and honour the independent commission's report?  If so, it should proceed to implement it in the usual way by laying legislation before this House.  Is today simply a day out, to allow Members to ventilate their concerns, or is it meant as a serious exercise?I am also concerned that the commission has had, for some time, a rather extraordinary concentration of three seat constituencies in the north and west of Dublin city.  The Constitution clearly makes provision that to give effect to proportional representation to the highest degree possible, we should not have an over concentration of three seat constituencies.  Three seat constituencies arise from the dictates of demographic and geographic considerations.  However, as Deputies have said, there are profound arguments in favour of moving to five seat constituencies in Kerry and Tipperary.  On the issue of the concentration of three seat constituencies in north and west Dublin, I do not know what the commission's thinking was on the matter.  It means that, in terms of proportionality, this and previous reports of the commission have been quite seriously defective.In addition, leeway is given in the Constitution for under and over representation.  To take an example, Dublin West has been continually under represented in the commission's boundary recommendations.  So much so that at the time of the last election, Dublin West was fully entitled to one extra Deputy.  Dublin North, as Deputy Darragh O'Brien pointed out, was just marginally shy of the population required for one additional Deputy.  It is very difficult to understand the thinking of the commission and its absolute failure to take into account population growth when making its calculations on under and over representation.I am aware that population growth is not a point of reference which is provided for in the Constitution.  However, one must say at times that Mr. Eamon de Valera was an extraordinarily far-seeing man in that he allowed a very large amount of leeway so that it is possible for the commission, in its deliberations, to be cognisant of the fact that, for instance, the areas west and north of Dublin city and the Drogheda area are all growing at an enormous pace.  Indeed, in the rest of the country, certain areas are significant growth centres and therefore are likely, by the time of the next boundary revision, to have enjoyed a surge in population which ought to be reflected in the under and over representation provisions made by the commission.Other Deputies representing Dublin North and Dublin West have spoken about the failure of the commission to recognise the new town of Swords and, on previous occasions, the new town of Blanchardstown.  In 1991 I was first elected to Dublin County Council.  People from north Dublin and Swords may not believe this but at that time, north Dublin then extended down to the very leafy suburbs of Deerpark in Castleknock and Mulhuddart.  That was the reason for the famous occasion when the former Deputy and then Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, was at the opening of an estate and had some trees planted.  Then, when the ungrateful electorate in the local area — perhaps because they did not know him — did not vote for him, he ensured that the trees were taken back.  That happened in what is now the Dublin 15 area.  We must bear in mind that boundaries have been changed before.  At that time, it was not done by a commission but by the then Minister.  Boundaries have shifted.There is a case put forward by the Swords Electoral Boundary Action Group which is very deserving of attention.  It explains in some detail why River Valley, Highfield and areas such as Knocksedan should naturally stay with the Swords area and the town of which they are part, which should be part of the Dublin North constituency.  I will be honoured, obviously, to represent the people of that area.  I have the good fortune to know it exceptionally well so it is not a personal difficulty for me to represent the area.  However, I appreciate and agree with the concerns of the people in Swords that cutting off 12,000 votes in Swords and tagging them on to Dublin West is very difficult.  It increases the democratic deficit and decreases the capacity of people to know their TDs and public representatives.Another difficulty which I wish to refer to briefly concerns the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is currently overseeing a commission on local election boundaries.  He has said that the local election boundaries and ward revisions should relate to constituencies.  Does that mean that the people in the aforementioned parts of Swords will be put in with Mulhuddart for local election voting?  That will actually make the current bad situation even worse.All of the rumours are that the Green Party and the Minister are involved in an attempt to tee up larger local election ward areas in order to advantage the parties in Government, and the Green Party in particular.  However, attempts to massage boundaries to facilitate particular political parties, of all shapes, tend to blow up in one's face.  I ask the Minister to clarify, with regard to the local authority ward revisions, if Swords will be added into Mulhuddart.  If so, it will make a bad situation much worse for the people there.  Although I will be happy to represent the area, I believe the commission is wrong in this instance.The Government is trying to play both sides of the field in having this debate while not being absolutely clear about whether it will implement the commission's report.  It has no option but to stand by the commission.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I welcome this opportunity to speak on this report.  In general, we as democrats accept that if the House sets up an independent commission to deal with a particular thing, that body is independent, as no doubt will be accepted in this case.  The Bill will support the report of the commission.  However, I have misgivings about certain aspects of it.  The commission has taken the easy option.  While, on balance, the vast majority of the report stands up to scrutiny, it has singularly let down smaller counties.I can speak in personal terms of how the electorate and population of Carlow believe the commission has not kept to its terms of the reference under which it was asked to take into account county boundaries.  It has not done so in the case of Carlow.  It was also asked to take into account geographic features.  Again in the case of Carlow it has not done so.  It is even more tragic that this report has recommended, effectively, the halving of the county of Leitrim in terms of constituency division. To a large extent, I was a voice in a wilderness for a long time making the case for County Carlow but now the commission has gone a step further.  It is not alone the fact that Carlow is a county, it has one of the smallest population bases in the country.  I am glad to hear that Members from all sides of the House acknowledge that this is a mistake the commission should acknowledge.  I support the Taoiseach in the comments he made on the Order of Business some months ago when he said we should not abdicate our responsibilities and we have an option to change the commission's report.  I do not believe that will happen, but if there was all-party support for that, I would be delighted to see it happen.It is wrong that a population in one county is effectively represented by a TD from a different constituency.  The wearing of the county jersey still means a great deal in rural Ireland.  People have an affinity and a loyalty to their county.  This report does not acknowledge that.  I refer to the population of east Carlow who are represented by county councillors on Carlow County Council, which is also their  planning authority.  Their postal service and all their utilities are based in Carlow.  The Garda, in its wisdom, changed the Garda district and it is now represented in Carlow.  The telephone service and social and economic services of the people of east Carlow are all based in Carlow.  However, when it comes to voting, they must vote for somebody in the Wicklow constituency.  That is patently wrong.One of the main criticisms I hear in the run up to every general election is from individuals in east Carlow.  They say we are the legislators and have the power to do something about this, but we are letting them down.  In a large proportion of cases these people refuse to vote.  They are Carlow people and want to vote in Carlow, but are not allowed to do so.  The people of east Carlow have been let down by this report.  I hope that the next commission set up will take account of smaller counties.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I am glad to have this opportunity to make a few brief comments on this subject.  I listened with interest to the contributions of many speakers.  Some Deputies would question whether it was a good idea to have this debate, but I believe it was and many good ideas have been raised during it.Many Members expressed concern about the decisions of the boundary commission.  It is an independent group set up to examine all electoral boundaries.  When this process was dealt with by politicians, people were not happy and complained about it.  Therefore, if we give people a job, we must accept their findings.I represent Sligo-North Leitrim.  County Leitrim is the county that has been most affected particularly by recommendations of the last two boundary commission reports.  The report prior to this one split Leitrim in two thirds and one third between the constituencies of Roscommon-South Leitrim and Sligo-North Leitrim.  Leitrim failed to elect a TD in the county.  Leitrim is a proud county with proud people.  They were aggrieved by what happened on the previous occasion.Under the boundary revision before us, it is recommended that instead of Leitrim being split, in constituency division terms, in two thirds and one third where there was a chance of a TD being elected in south Leitrim, that it be split in two.  Taking the population of Leitrim as being 25,000, if one divides that number in two and taking an electorate of even 75%, there is no way a Leitrim person could be elected to represent the county.  As a public representative for that area, I will endeavour to do my best, as a Sligo person, to represent the people of Sligo-North Leitrim and, I hope I will represent the people within the new boundary commission's recommendations.  Nevertheless, the people of Leitrim feel aggrieved.There is something wrong when a county such as Leitrim, one of the smallest counties, is divided in two in constituency division terms.  It is a bad idea.  It is unfair to the people who live in the county that a politician in the county cannot get elected to the Dáil.  It is physically impossible, given that the county does not have the numbers in terms of votes.  The commission is independent and very little can be done about its recommendations in respect of that county.I listened, with interest, to Deputy Burton's contribution.  She spoke about the English system, with which I am not familiar.  It is a rolling system and voter registration is examined on an ongoing basis.  When a revision is due, a discussion takes place prior to it.  It might not be a bad idea to follow that process here and perhaps it is a system we should examine.The recommendations of the last boundary commission, particularly for the north west in terms of Sligo-Leitrim is not the way we should go.  People were disappointed about that.  I fully understand that the commission is independent, it has a job to do and politicians cannot be seen to interfere.  If they did, they would be accused of gerrymandering in terms of boundaries.  I am glad to have had this opportunity to make those few points.

I understand the Constituency Commission is an independent body and anything that follows should not be construed as undermining its independence.  I understand it is independent and that its independence must be protected.However, I must represent the views of my constituents, in particular the people of Swords.  The Constituency Commission has seen fit to remove Portmarnock from my constituency and I can understand there being a certain geographical logic to that decision.  However, I am sorry to lose those constituents of mine from Carrighill, Torcaill, Ardilaun, The Dunes, Beechwood, Dal Riada, to mention but a few, whom I had the pleasure to represent for a short period.  Portmarnock has been an integral part of Dublin North for so long that the people there will find it difficult to come to terms with the change.  It has, also, been represented by a very energetic, young Fine Gael councillor, Alan Farrell, who is currently Lord Mayor and who has given great service in the area.Swords has grown tremendously in recent years and is now the undisputed capital of Fingal and the Fingal County Council offices are located there.  There are further great plans for the town, including the long-awaited and oft promised metro north.  Swords has been planned as a single entity in terms of its buildings, transport, schooling and policing systems and the current plan to hive off a third of the area, approximately 13,000 residents, into Dublin West will have many negative affects.First, this denies the town its full identity.  Second, the 13,000 residents transferred to Dublin West will, effectively, have a much reduced franchise as they will only make up 12% of the electorate in that area and will be dislocated geographically from the remainder of the Dublin West constituency.  Third, the change could impede the cohesiveness of Sword's development into the future.  Fingal County Council has sought to create a new identity and has been very successful in doing so for Fingal.  The breaking up of Swords runs contrary to this.Swords is very much an entity, being very distinct from Malahide, Santry or the other towns of Dublin North.  Splitting it in two makes no sense from a political perspective and weakens the influence of Swords as a voting entity.  It is currently one electoral ward.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Constituency Commission not to interfere with the area's integrity for the forthcoming council elections.   While a mathematical problem and solution might explain the Constituency Commission's proposal, it makes no sense from the point of view of Government, governance, administration nor for the representation of the people of west Swords in estates such as River Valley Estate, Boroimhe, Ridgewood, Knocksedan Demesne, Highfields, Hawthorn Park, The Nurseries, Oulart, Forest Hills, Boru Court or the Forest Road.  The people from these estates will have to travel all the way to Blanchardstown, 10 km away, to see their public  representatives.  This may not be far in the country, but in north Dublin it takes a long time.While respecting the independence of the commission, one must speak out when what it proposes does not make sense.  The impact of such proposals on the people is negative in every sense.  No argument can be made for this bizarre and purely arbitrary redrawing of the constituency that would demonstrate it confers any advantage on the people of Swords.  In light of these arguments and the strong feeling on the ground, this division of Swords for electoral purposes must be redressed.  I hope the Constituency Commission will address these concerns and reverse its decision at the earliest opportunity.  It should do so before the next general election when the provisional census figures come in.Notwithstanding its independence, the commission has created serious problems for the people of Swords and has done them a considerable disservice by failing to realise the implications for our citizens versus the need for greater fairness in numerical representation.  I hope it will be able to square the circle before the next election.  I also hope that before the next election I will find that the people of Swords remain as my constituents.  One way or the other, I intend to keep representing them to the best of my ability.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The Constituency Commission is the third commission established under the 1997 Act.  The reports of the first two statutory commissions, together with those of the five earlier non-statutory Dáil constituency commissions, and reports on European Parliament constituencies, were all accepted and implemented.  It is our duty to prescribe the legislation to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission.  Therefore, what we should debate today is the legislation.  A discussion such as this, if it was to take place, should have taken place before the commission sat and before it started its deliberations.It is obvious that the Taoiseach or someone else is not happy with the recommendations of the commission.  Reports from the Dáil bar, from where most rumours of this House emanate, suggest there were doubts over this commission a long time ago.  This news has now got out to the constituencies and there is major uncertainty in them with regard to who represents whom.In my constituency, a large electoral area with more than 5,000 voters was removed from the constituency and added to the Ceann Comhairle's Kerry South constituency.  He now represents those people and I understand he now holds clinics in the area.  There is a question with regard to another area in Limerick West with 13,000 voters.  Who represents them now?  There is a dilemma for communities as to who represents them and a dilemma for politicians as to whether they will continue to represent them.  The question is whether the recommendations in this report will be in place by the next election.  Are we not entitled to know that?It is important that the Minister gives us a clear statement this afternoon and states whether these recommendations will be in force.  Will he clarify the situation and say whether this will be the case so that we can avoid uncertainty?  It is unfair on Deputies and the communities they represent to be left in this dilemma.  A statement from the Minister could clarify the situation once and for all.With regard to the area of my constituency that I will lose, the people of Castleisland, Cordal and the new area of Camp were comfortable with me as their representative.  I was proud to represent them and had built up a great connection with those communities.  They were sad to be leaving the Kerry North constituency.  However, west Limerick and north Kerry have a great affinity, share a culture and have a similar topography.  I look forward to representing that part of my constituency in the future as the new constituency of North Kerry-West Limerick.  I am pleased with the reception I have received from the various communities in the area.  The commission could, possibly, have more appropriately provided two four seat constituencies in Limerick.  In 1921, in the second Dáil, Kerry and Limerick West formed one eight seat constituency.  The same was true for the June election of 1922.  There is, therefore, a historical significance to the decision to unite these Kerry and Limerick constituencies.I hope that as a result of today's discussions the Government will not ignore the report of the electoral commission nor deliberately delay its implementation.  At the moment, the Government seems to be deliberately delaying its implementation, despite the High Court judgment in 2007 which stated the Government was obliged to implement the recommendations of the commission with minimum delay.  Surely a decision made months ago should be implemented by now.  We should be discussing the legislation to implement the decision of the commission by now rather than having a discussion on the decision.This discussion should have taken place before the commission was set up and established to report on the boundaries.  That would have been the logical approach.  Now, we have created uncertainty in communities that are about to be changed.  We need, at least, clarification on that so that Deputies do not use their valuable time representing a constituency that may not be in their area for the next election.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue as it is important to debate an issue that will affect all politicians.  The terms of reference for the commission as set out in section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997 state:A Constituency Commission shall, in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution in relation to Dáil constituencies, have regard to the following:Section 6 of the Electoral Act 1997 lays down the terms of reference for the Constituency Commission.  Section 6(20)(c) states, “the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable”.  The commission missed an opportunity to unite urban villages such as Terenure.  Political representatives must also protect these urban villages which have come under attack from planners and traffic management czars.  Terenure is perceived by the traffic management office in Dublin City Council as an obstacle to transporting commuters to and from Dublin city centre.  Dublin City Council planners, using the area management structure, have divided Terenure into two administrative areas, one based in Dublin South-Central and the other in Dublin South-East.  Terenure has been partitioned and it is important we reunite the village.  Its sense of social community has been divided and its political representation weakened.While residents in Terenure can call on Deputies from two constituencies, due to its divided administrative structure many issues raised at residents' association meetings are not always relevant to all Deputies and councillors.  Very often when the full complement of Deputies, councillors and Dublin city council officials attends a meeting, there are more on the officialdom side than on the  residents' due to the weakened sense of community.  I hope there will be an opportunity to reflect on the commission's recommendations for areas such as Terenure and it is brought either into Dublin South-East or Dublin South-Central.  The residents would not be disappointed if that were to happen.People believe that Deputies should have an input into constituency revisions.  Yet when we did in the past, people were critical of that.  I am not critical of the Constituency Commission but I hope there is some opportunity to strike a balance.Deputy John Cregan already spoke of the 13,000 people from the Limerick West constituency being moved to the Kerry North constituency which will have an impact.  They have been well served in the past by Deputies John Cregan and Niall Collins.  Deputy Thomas McEllistrim is now making efforts to build a political base there.  While I am sure Deputy Jimmy Deenihan will be more than happy to cater for their every concern, people from places like Athea are Limerick born and bred.  The idea of them being in the Kerry North constituency has led to bad feeling and a sense of exclusion has emerged.  They are in limbo because they are not sure who their Deputies are.In the case of Terenure we have missed an opportunity for villages, both urban and rural, to develop, expand and strengthen their sense of community.  I would like if that aspect of the commission's report could be reassessed.

The Government already approved the Constituency Commission's recommendations on 30 January.  People often claim the Dáil is only a talk-shop.  The Government has already made a decision and this debate should have been held long before the commission was established.I was elected by the people of Limerick East in the last general election.  Without any forewarning, 17,000 of them find they will now be in the Limerick County constituency.  Limerick, as a county, has been butchered to ensure two three seat constituencies are retained in County Kerry.  People from Oola, Cappamore, Doon, Pallas Green, Murroe, Caherconlish, Herbertstown, Hospital, Roxboro and Ballyneety have been represented by Deputies from the Limerick East constituency since 1948.  Having grown up in Limerick, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, will be aware of the great affinity between the county and the city, particularly in east Limerick.  I find it ironic that the commission found the revision "would allow Limerick East to reflect more fully the urban areas and Limerick West the rural areas".  Yet it also decided the Cork North-Central constituency would get 8,500 people from two rural constituencies, Cork East and Cork North-West.  Where is the logic in that?Why are we having statements on this commission report?

Not only did the commission breach the boundary but it annexed half of Limerick into Kerry.  As a Limerick man and as a fellow Munchins man, the Minister will be fully aware of how the people of Limerick East view being represented.  I will continue to represent them because they have elected me but the report makes no sense.  I assume the Minister will bring that part of the constituency back in before the next election.  I wonder if he expects the Government to last that long.

Prior to that date, the full county of Limerick was one constituency.  Since then, Limerick East has progressively lost county area and now a substantial portion is being taken.  An area of Roxboro which is literally on the boundary with Limerick city has been brought into Limerick West, probably to make up the numbers.  Limerick is suffering and County Limerick is losing a seat overall whereas according to the figures, Kerry North and Kerry South should have become one five seat constituency.I wish to put on record the upset of the people on the county side, the east Limerick side.  I would like to continue to represent them and I hope that the Minister, Deputy Gormley and the Government follow through so that when the preliminary census figures for 2010 are published, they will set up a commission to reconsider the situation and ensure that these people continue to be represented by the TDs they elected.  The situation is currently very unsatisfactory.  The Cabinet agreed this on 30 January yet the Government side is acting as if it is not agreed.I hope that before the next election the boundaries will be changed and that I will continue to represent the people on the east Limerick side thereafter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	404	The Government has a decision to make on whether it will adopt the recommendations of a commission which it set up.  Deputy O'Donnell is correct; it does not make sense to break county boundaries and bring Limerick into Kerry.  I come from Connacht-Ulster.  The people of this country died for the right to have a parliament.  If the people of 1916 up to 1921 were alive today they would turn in their graves with regard to this referendum which will be held soon.  However, I will not deal with that subject today.  They fought to have the vote; they fought for people to have a right to their own parliament.  County Leitrim is a small county.  I do not understand how any member of the commission could see fit to break up County Leitrim so that it would not have representation in Dáil Éireann.  This is a disgrace and it goes against this Republic, against this Parliament and against what we all stand for, which is for people to have rights and representation in this House.Whenever the next commission is formed, it must reverse this decision.  County Leitrim is entitled to have representation in this Parliament.  I am in a constituency which was a two-seater and a three-seater, Mayo East and Mayo West.  In part of Mayo West at one time I represented part of Galway and I used to go to Headford.  It was a crazy situation.  I was writing to the county manager in Galway on one issue and writing to the Mayo county manager on other issues.  People lived on the border and people under pressure were coming to me with their problems.  I found it very difficult to obtain replies.  I find it very difficult to obtain replies from the Minister for Finance and his Department and from the Department of Education and Science.  It is very difficult to obtain replies from local authorities.I thank the Fianna Fáil people who now speak to me privately and say they were sorry they did not support me on the question of the dual mandate.  I am sorry myself that I did not go the whole hog and bring it to the Supreme Court and let the people judge on it.A constituent of mine is thinking of taking a separate case on the basis that the people believe they have been deprived, that the Government is taking away from them the right to choose whom they wish to vote for.  The Government is saying I cannot stand in the local elections and the people must make that decision.  There might be another case in the offing and the courts may have to make a decision.It does not make sense to put part of Limerick into Kerry.  It would be fine for Kerry to be a three-seater if it had the numbers but if not it should have been a five-seater like Mayo.I live in Westport.  If I go to Belmullet and Blacksod I am almost 60 miles away from my home.  I have to travel from there to Shrule for a clinic on the third week of every month and I am another 30 to 40 miles away from my home.  If I go to public meetings in Ballina, I am 40 miles away from home.  I am saying this against myself but I would prefer to see Mayo have a three-seater and a two-seater rather than one five-seater because it is impossible to cover the size of that constituency.

I would like to know if they went down to County Leitrim or to County Limerick.  I would like to know whether they have ever stood in County Mayo to see one part of the county from the other.  It is often the case that people in Dublin 4, 5, 6, and 7, make decisions about people's lives but they have never been in some of these counties.  They do not understand what rural life is about.The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is sitting beside the Minister for Finance.  I would never say that about him because he has an understanding of how rural life works and how rural people think.  I hope he will educate the Minister for Finance and ensure Deputy Lenihan gives him the necessary funding.  We should be able to keep the quality of life we have in rural Ireland, as well as keeping people in rural areas, without having the situation they have in Dublin, of which the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is aware.

When he comes up here he thinks he is among the people, but he is not really.  The minute one leaves the west, one leaves the people and the country.  I hope the Minister will not forget his roots, like Deputy Gormley.  He seems to have forgotten his roots since he left Limerick.  When he was in Opposition he had many roots, but he has none at all now he is with Fianna Fáil.If the Constituency Commission makes a recommendation we must accept it even if we do not like it.  There is no point in establishing a commission if we are not going to accept its rulings.  There will not be a vote following these statements but if there was, some of the Fianna Fáil Members would vote with the Government even though they spoke against some aspects of the report.  They would not do the right thing for their own constituents.  I hope that when the commission is reformed and considers the latest census and the constituencies, it will stop breaking down boundaries and putting parts of counties into others where people do not want them.  The situation is similar to local GAA teams who love their areas and their counties and want to be part of that.  When some Galway people were in Mayo they felt they were not being represented because they had no great love for Mayo politicians.  They would prefer to have been voting for their own politicians in their own county.On behalf of the people of Leitrim, I appeal to the three Ministers present to see if anything can be done for that county.  Leitrim forms part of Deputy Perry's constituency but he is from Sligo and it is wrong that County Leitrim has no representation in this House.  It is a small county but it is entitled to have representation here.  That matter should be examined, particularly when the new boundary commission is re-established.  It should be readdressed so that Leitrim can have the Dáil representation to which it is entitled.  I want Fine Gael representatives and I also want Deputy Perry to be left there.  He should have more help from the Fine Gael representative in Leitrim, Michael Comiskey.  It is important that Leitrim has Dáil representation.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	417	On that very point concerning county boundaries, Leitrim is a unique case.  Following the commission's report, the Minister should examine how county boundaries can be respected with a population of less than 30,000.  We must accept the long tradition, history and heritage of that county which has undergone unprecedented development in recent years.  The county has achieved so much as a result of the Government's initiative for the upper Shannon renewal scheme.  However, State institutions, including local authority services, are fragmented between north and south Leitrim.  This case is unique.  Most people expected that when the independent commission's final document was given to the Government it would have clearly respected Leitrim's county boundary.  I realise that by changing the status quo there would be a reaction in another county.  However, the case made by the campaigning team in Leitrim was that, with a population of less than 30,000, a direction should have been given to the commission to respect the county boundary.  The situation would be different with a population of 70,000 or 100,000 but in Leitrim’s case a derogation would have ensured that there would be a Leitrim-based Teachta Dála.  Recognising Leitrim’s county boundary would be a vote of confidence in its people, traditions, history and heritage, as well as the level of investment there.As a Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim, which was originally a four seat constituency, I know there was great unity of purpose in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, knows this well as he worked astutely on the case of the partnership companies, and I congratulate him for that.  It was a difficult job to create partnership schemes that reflected county boundaries while achieving the work involved.  One example of fully respecting county boundaries was when the Minister successfully brought west Sligo into the Leader programme's Sligo executive.  Prior to that, it was operated by two different schemes.  Likewise, that was the case in Leitrim with the implementation of partnership companies.I am glad the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is here for this debate.  When he was in Opposition he was always conscious of the entitlement of citizens of a given county to have their voices heard in the Dáil.  Can the Minister say if there will be another constituency review prior to the next general election?  The county council review is due in June, which will be welcome.   The eminent and highly qualified people who compiled the commission's report had a clear mandate but no distinct directive was given that they were obliged to respect county boundaries.  I hope the Minister will indicate that a review will take place before the next general election.  This is desirable in light of the High Court ruling that the Minister is obliged to implement the recommendations of the Constituency Commission with minimal delay.  Will the Minister clarify what he proposes to do following today's detailed statements?  Is this just a talking shop or can there be any revision of the commission's report prior to its implementation?  Can the commission be asked to re-examine the issue in light of concerns expressed by a large number of elected representatives from all political persuasions?Leitrim is a major issue which has been widely debated.  On the day he was elected, the Taoiseach mentioned the cases of Clare and Leitrim.  As Deputy Ring correctly stated, while it is hard to accept all the issues in respect of everyone's entitlements in other parts of the country, Leitrim is a special case without any doubt.  Politicians, State bodies and the general public find this issue to be anomalous, even if they have no association with Leitrim.Dublin has 47 Deputies whereas County Leitrim has none.  If one tours the county from Tullaghan to Carrick-on-Shannon one will find that it is a big county.  Given the demographics of the region, it is very successfully represented by county councillors but it is disappointing that it does not have a resident Deputy.  There would be no Leitrim representative in the Seanad either but for the fact that the Taoiseach appointed one.  The case for a Leitrim-based TD is justifiable.It is a privilege for me to work for everyone in the constituency but people have an affinity with their own county.  They also have an affinity to a native son or daughter who seeks election to the Oireachtas from their own county.  It is important to give them a sporting chance to do so, but that chance has been denied.  It is not just a question of coming back with the recommendations in this regard, although I respect the commission's independence.  The Minister had a clear mandate that in council elections three-seaters must become four-seaters.  I believe the recommendation was that there were to be no three-seaters in the new councils, although that may not be correct.

Is this a closed shop?  Does the Minister propose to give a new mandate to the commission to revisit certain parts of the country or the whole country again, in light of the huge population shift?  There has been a huge population shift in many parts of the region.This is an important issue and one I have raised on numerous occasions in the past.  I genuinely believe that Leitrim needs a clear message from the Minister.  It is a unique county with an historical past and a fantastic association with Leinster House of outstanding parliamentarians.  They would like to think they have a sporting chance of that happening again.  They want an indication from the Minister that by the next general election, Leitrim will be reunified and will have a mandate to elect its own member from that great county.  Leitrim is a very special case.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to this important debate.  Deputies raised a large number of issues across the electoral horizon but in the limited time available I will focus on issues specific to the report of the Constituency Commission.  There will be other opportunities to deal with other issues.I wish to make a general point.  Some Deputies have suggested alternatives to the scheme of constituencies recommended by the commission in its report and some Deputies are clearly unhappy with particular recommendations.  Many other Deputies, perhaps the majority, and certainly the Fine Gael spokesperson was adamant that we should stick to the recommendations of the commission.  I emphasise that it is very important that we maintain the long-established practice of implementing the recommendations of constituency commissions in full.To reject some of the commission's recommendations would be to revert to the partisan approach of the past when constituency revisions were perceived as having been framed to secure political advantage for the Government of the day.  Even minor changes to the commission's recommendations would represent the first step back to the unsatisfactory situation that applied in the past.  I, as Minister, do not want to go down that particular road.Mr. Justice Clarke's judgment last year emphasises the urgent obligation on the Oireachtas to revise constituencies as soon as it becomes clear from a census that the existing constituencies no longer have the level of proportionality that the Constitution requires.  I gave examples of the current serious disparities in my earlier contribution.  We need to act quickly.  The debate showed the strong attachment to county boundaries——
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	424	That is the issue.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	425	——as raised by the Deputy opposite.  While attachment to county boundaries is, of course, understandable, the terms of reference of commissions are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions which do not refer to counties.In the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Budd in the O'Donovan case, it was stated:. . . although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties.  The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries.There is no absolute prohibition on the breach of county boundaries.  The experience has been that at times the constitutional provisions require such action, difficult though that may be.As I have already advised the House, work is under way on the drafting of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 which will provide for revision of the Dáil and European Parliament constituencies in accordance with the recommendations of the Constituency Commission.  The Government approved the drafting of the necessary Bill at its meeting on 30 January 2008.  The drafting work is well advanced.  My Department is working with the Attorney General's office to ensure the Bill will be published as soon as possible.  The passage of the Bill through both Houses will provide a further opportunity for Members to debate the recommendations of the commission.I welcome very much the comments made during the course of the debate from those Deputies who acknowledge the integrity and independence of the commission.  I express my thanks to the commission members for their hard work.  I again thank Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further debate on the important issues involved when the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 comes before the House.

It is that rule that defines relationships between private individuals or entities in society and between the State and those individuals or entities.The law has never been simple because society, made up of myriad interconnecting relationships, has never been simple.  In today's increasingly prosperous and complex society, the law too reflects that complexity.  That being the case, there has always been and will continue to be a need for experts in the law to advise and assist those who seek to invoke the law to resolve disputes, to assert or protect a right or to defend against claims which they consider are not well founded or are detrimental to their interests.The proper working of our society depends on there being a cohort of lawyers who make their services available to those involved, or potentially involved, in litigation.  This accords to solicitors and barristers a central role in our democratic society through advising, representing and facilitating persons in their quest for justice.  Persons seeking legal services take solicitors and barristers completely into their confidence regarding complex private and personal matters.  All lawyers have a heavy responsibility to ensure their clients' best interests in family, personal, business and other matters.The legal profession has traditionally been organised in Ireland in two branches, solicitors and barristers, each largely self-regulating.  With self-regulation, the professions generally are vulnerable to accusations that complaints against practitioners are not properly investigated.  The legal professions are not unique in this regard.A fundamental part of self-regulation is concerned with the maintenance of high professional standards and the investigation of allegations that those high standards have not been met in particular cases.  The procedures put in place by both branches of the legal profession to address complaints of poor professional performance or misconduct have evolved over many years.While, on the whole, the self-regulating processes operate satisfactorily, there naturally remains the possibility that a person who makes a complaint against a lawyer may get a result from those processes that does not accord with his or her view of the matter.  Their sense of dissatisfaction may sometimes be coloured by the perception that the self-regulating process has favoured the professional over the complainant.  This perception can arise simply because the process is self-regulatory regardless of whether there has been actual bias in a particular case.The Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008 strengthens the mechanisms for dealing with complaints against both solicitors and barristers.  The Bill will establish a legal services ombudsman who will oversee the handling by the Law Society and Bar Council of three classes of complaint against solicitors and barristers, namely inadequate services, excessive fees and misconduct.  The key function will be to provide a form of appeal for clients of solicitors and barristers who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a complaint made to the Law Society or Bar Council.The objective of any complaints system is that both the public and the practitioner have confidence that complaints are processed in a fair and effective manner without undue delay.  To ensure that this objective is met, the legal services ombudsman will act to oversee the operation of the complaints systems of the two professional bodies.  These complaints systems, which I will describe for the information of Deputies, are elaborate and designed to give an aggrieved client access to redress when a practitioner fails to provide an acceptable legal service, while also protecting the practitioner from unwarranted or malicious claims.Complaints against barristers by members of the public may be made to the Bar Council's professional conduct tribunal comprising barristers and lay persons.  Complaints are handled in private and may be dealt with by way of an oral hearing.  If a complaint goes to an oral hearing, both parties are invited to attend and both may be legally represented.  The tribunal's decision may be appealed by either party to a three member appeal board chaired by a High Court judge with two other members nominated by the Bar Council and Attorney General.  Where there is a finding of misconduct the disciplinary code of the Bar Council sets out a range of penalties which can be imposed on barristers ranging from an admonishment to a fine to disbarment.The Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2002 regulate the solicitors' profession.  In particular, Part III of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 makes detailed provision for the investigation of complaints against solicitors.  Complaints to the Law Society generally fall into two broad categories, namely, complaints of misconduct and complaints of inadequate service or excessive fees.  There may be a degree of overlap between these categories.  The Law Society's complaints and client relations committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints lodged directly to it by members of the public.Complaints of misconduct against solicitors may be made by clients to either the Law Society or Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  Where a complaint of misconduct has been made to the society in the first instance, it may be referred by the society to the tribunal and such complaints would then be liable to attract the heavier end of the scale of sanctions.The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal is an independent statutory tribunal appointed by the President of the High Court to investigate complaints of misconduct against solicitors under section 16 of Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994.  The members of the tribunal are appointed by the President of the High Court and include lay members.As I stated, the Law Society may refer complaints to the tribunal and every client of a solicitor has a right to make a direct application to the tribunal.  The tribunal has limited judicial powers and its primary function is to establish, by evidence and documents, the facts of a complaint and decide whether misconduct is proved.  Where there is a finding of misconduct the tribunal can itself impose a sanction on the solicitor ranging from admonishment to a direction to pay restitution of a sum not exceeding €15,000 to any aggrieved party.  In more serious cases the tribunal may refer its finding and recommendation to the President of the High Court who ultimately will decide on the nature of the sanction to be imposed on the solicitor.  The powers of sanction available to the High Court can range up to striking the solicitor off the roll.  If either party is unhappy with a decision of the tribunal, it may be appealed to the High Court.The disciplinary regime for solicitors was strengthened in a number of respects by the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002.  The Act doubled the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases.  The tribunal is required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct and have regard to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in a current case.  The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society's compensation fund was increased from £5,000 to €15,000.  A right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work was inserted and remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations were provided.  In addition, the circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate were spelled out in more detail and the circumstances in which it can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office were extended.The tribunal performs a pivotal role in the solicitors' disciplinary process and dealt with recent high profile cases.  In addition to the provisions of the 2002 Act, a number of the recommendations made in a 2004 review of the Law Society's regulatory functions — the Brosnan report — are being implemented in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 which recently completed all Stages in this House.  For example, the 2006 Bill provides for a majority of lay membership of regulatory committees and provision is made to ensure better enforcement of orders of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.The Government recognises that further measures are necessary to enhance confidence in the complaints systems of the two professions.  For this reason, legislative proposals for the establishment of a legal services ombudsman received Government approval.I propose to address the specific provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 deals with preliminary and general matters.  Section 1 sets out the Short Title and contains standards commencement provisions.  Section 2 sets out the interpretation of principal terms referred to throughout the Bill.  Section 3 is another standard provision that any expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.Part 2 is concerned with the establishment, role and accountability of the office of the legal services ombudsman.  Section 4 provides for the establishment of the ombudsman's office and section 5 deals with the appointment of the person of legal services ombudsman.  Subsection (1) stipulates that the legal services ombudsman shall be appointed by the Government.  Subsection (2) provides that the Government must be satisfied the person appointed is suitably qualified, while subsection (3) specifies those persons not eligible for appointment as ombudsman, including a practising barrister or solicitor, member of the Law Society, member of the Bar Council or a bencher of the Honourable Society of King's Inns.Provision is made in section 6 for the ombudsman's period of office, which shall not exceed six years, as well as the reappointment of the ombudsman for a second or subsequent term.  Subsection (3) provides for the manner in which the ombudsman may resign from office, while subsection (4) provides for the circumstances in which the Government may remove the ombudsman from office, including ill health, stated misbehaviour, bankruptcy, failure to perform the functions of office or court conviction and imprisonment.  Subsection (6) provides for the circumstances in which a person ceases to hold the office of legal services ombudsman, namely, nomination to Seanad Éireann, election to either House of the Oireachtas or European Parliament or on becoming a member of a local authority.Section 7 makes provision for Government to determine the terms and conditions relating to remuneration of the ombudsman and section 8 restricts the ombudsman from engaging in other paid employment unless approved by the Minister.  Section 9 outlines the general functions and powers of the legal services ombudsman.  These are to receive and investigate complaints; review the procedures of the Bar Council and Law Society for dealing with complaints made to them by clients of barristers and solicitors; assess the adequacy of the admissions policies of the two professional bodies; and improve public awareness of their complaints procedures.In section 11 standard provisions are made for the appointment of staff to the office of the ombudsman and the engagement of professional and other advisers.  Subsection (5) provides for the delegation to a member of staff certain functions assigned to the ombudsman in the Bill.The office of the legal services ombudsman is to be funded entirely by means of a levy on the two professional bodies.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to provide for advance funding from my Department, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, and section 12 provides for such advances.Section 13 provides for financial accounting and audit matters by the ombudsman, including audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the presentation of the audited accounts to the Minister and their laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas.Section 14 provides for various periodic reports to be made by the ombudsman to the Minister.  The ombudsman is also required to produce an annual report on the adequacy of the admission policies of the legal professions.  The report must specify the numbers admitted annually to legal practice for the year in question, as well as an assessment that the numbers admitted are consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of legal services at a reasonable cost.  Again, this report will be laid before the Oireachtas and published.Sections 16 and 17 provide for the appearance of the ombudsman before the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Provision is made in section 18 for various publications to be privileged for the purposes of the law of defamation, namely, any matter in a report of the ombudsman laid before either House of the Oireachtas and publications by the ombudsman directed to particular persons or bodies.As I indicated, the office of the legal services ombudsman will be funded by means of a levy on the Law Society and Bar Council.  Section 19 provides that the office of the ombudsman be financed by way of an annual charge on the Law Society and Bar Council, calculated by reference to the number of complaints made to the ombudsman relating to solicitors and barristers, respectively, subject to a minimum charge on each body of at least 10% of the total annual cost.  This ensures proportionality in the levy provisions which will have a direct relationship to the degree to which each profession attracts complaints.  The minimum charge also takes account of the costs of carrying out the ombudsman's functions additional to investigating individual complaints, including reviewing the complaints mechanisms and admissions policies of the two bodies.Section 20 empowers the Minister to make regulations relating to the levy on such matters as the manner in which the number of complaints made is to be determined, the date payment of the levy falls due, the keeping of records by the ombudsman and the rate of interest on amounts not paid when due.Part 4 contains the substantive provisions relating to the ombudsman's functions in respect of complaints and reviews.  The ombudsman has a variety of powers under Part 4 in the investigation of complaints, including under section 22 — to conduct investigations; section 26 — to require persons to provide information and to attend before the ombudsman; section 27 — to issue directions or make recommendations; and section 30 — enforcement of directions.Sections 21 and 22 provide for the making and investigation of complaints.  A complaint may be made by a client of a barrister or solicitor to the ombudsman concerning the handling by the Bar Council or Law Society of a related complaint against a barrister or solicitor.  A complaint may also be made by a client of a solicitor to the ombudsman about a decision of the Law Society to make or to refuse a grant from the Law Society's compensation fund.Section 22 provides for the types of complaints which may be made to the ombudsman.  These include complaints arising where the Law Society or Bar Council has failed to commence or complete an investigation of a related complaint within a reasonable time and cases of inadequate investigation.  Under section 23, the ombudsman may seek the resolution of complaints in such a manner as he or she considers appropriate and reasonable, and the ombudsman may establish procedures to be followed for the receipt, resolution and investigation of complaints.  These procedures will be published.The ombudsman shall conduct investigations in private in accordance with section 25.  To ensure full co-operation with the investigation of a complaint, section 26 provides that the ombudsman has the power to require the provision of information or attendance of any person before him where appropriate.  In the event that a person fails to comply with a request for information or attendance, subsection (6) provides that the ombudsman may apply to the High Court for an order requiring compliance.  Section 27 creates the offence of obstruction of the ombudsman in the performance of his or her functions, punishable by a fine not exceeding €2,000 on summary conviction.If the ombudsman is not satisfied that the related complaint was adequately investigated, he may direct the Bar Council to reinvestigate it under the Bar Council's disciplinary code, or in the case of the Law Society, direct the society to either re-investigate itself or refer the complaint to the solicitors' disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry on the grounds of alleged misconduct.  The ombudsman may make other directions and recommendations to both bodies, including a recommendation that the Law Society make or increase a grant out of its compensation fund.  The ombudsman may request the professional body to respond within a period specified to a direction given or recommendation made.  In the event of an unsatisfactory response, subsection (6) provides that the ombudsman may make a special report to the Minister under section 14.Section 29 provides that the ombudsman send a written statement on the results of the investigation, any direction given or recommendation made to the complainant, the relevant professional body and the barrister or solicitor concerned.  Section 30 provides that the ombudsman may apply to the High Court for an order to enforce compliance with a direction made.  Section 31 provides for the referral of any question of law by the ombudsman to the High Court for determination.A key function of the ombudsman is to keep under review the procedures of the Bar Council and the Law Society for receiving and investigating complaints about barristers and solicitors.  Section 32 makes extensive provision in this regard and provides that the ombudsman shall examine the complaints procedures of the two bodies, the co-operation of barristers and solicitors with these procedures, the effectiveness of the procedures and the time taken to complete investigations.Arising from his review, the ombudsman may make written recommendations to the Bar Council and Law Society to improve their complaints investigation procedures and to recommend the co-operation of barristers and solicitors with these.  If not satisfied with their response to a recommendation made, the ombudsman may direct that the recommendation or an amended recommendation be implemented.  Where the ombudsman considers it appropriate for a particular class or classes of complaint, he or she may direct the relevant professional body to put in place specific procedures to address such complaints.  The Bar Council or the Law Society may apply to the High Court to set aside or vary a direction made by the ombudsman.Section 33 provides that full and complete records be kept by both professional bodies of all investigations and proceedings relating to complaints.  Section 34 is a standard provision that legal proceedings may only be commenced against the ombudsman with the leave of the High Court on notice to the ombudsman.  Confidentiality of information in the possession of the office of the legal services ombudsman is ensured by section 35, which provides that the ombudsman or a member of staff may not, except in accordance with law, disclose any information obtained other than in specified circumstances.  Section 36 makes provision for the application of the Freedom of Information Act to the non-investigative records of the office of the ombudsman.The new measures the Government is taking in creating a legal services ombudsman and in acting on legal costs will transform the provision of legal services.  Taken with important initiatives put in place in recent years to tackle the so-called compensation culture in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, as well as the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the legal system is changing rapidly.  This change is essential to ensure that the legal system and the legal professions continue to meet the requirements of our modern, dynamic society.  The package of legislative measures taken already and those on the way will equip the legal system and the legal professions to react to the changing needs of a mature and progressive modern economy.The Government is anxious that regulation of the legal professions is improved and strengthened.  The enactment of this Bill, in addition to existing forms of oversight, will ensure that the highest of standards are maintained in the legal professions.  The provisions in this Bill for an independent review of the operation of the legal professions' complaints system by way of the legal services ombudsman is the way to proceed, consistent with the need for better regulation.  Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It puts on a statutory footing the office of the legal services ombudsman, which will oversee the handling of complaints by the Bar Council and the Law Society.  It will also review the procedures on admissions policy and will make reports to this House from time to time.  The creation of the post of legal services ombudsman is a most significant development in the provision of legal services to the people of this country.  Before Committee Stage of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, I made representations to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in which I strongly supported his proposal to remove provisions from that Bill that now form part of this Bill.  I did this because I felt it was important that the proposed ombudsman Bill would be set up on the basis of its own individual statute.  I do not believe that such a major development has any place in a Bill that reflected no more than a tidying up operation, something to which this House has become accustomed.I welcome Deputy Lenihan's recognition that the provisions on the legal services ombudsman needed a dedicated Bill of their own, with a careful examination by both Houses and by the appropriate committee.  It is unlikely that Members would have adequately scrutinised the measures on the ombudsman if they were not contained in a stand-alone individual Bill.  The case is the same for general practitioners and, more important, for members of the general public.  It is important that reference could be made to the legal services ombudsman Bill 2008, a dedicated title, rather than form part of another Bill.  In future, we should have stand-alone Bills for criminal and civil law, be they amendment or consolidation Bills, rather than miscellaneous provisions Bills that can run to many sections and cause a certain amount of confusion.Momentum for reform in this area has been building for some years.  The report of the Competition Authority, published in late 2006, pointed to a pressing need to introduce reform in this area.  The publication of the report on legal services provided some impetus for debate on the regulation of the legal profession, for both solicitors and barristers.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I wish to share time with Deputy Joan Burton.This is an important motion, although it is focused on a particular aspect of the current crisis in primary education.  The crisis has been caused by the trigger that has resulted in a number of schools automatically losing a teacher because their pupil numbers have dropped a very small margin.  It underlines the crisis that faces primary education, one that has been growing for some time.  As recently as 1995, the then Minister for Education who reformed so much of the system, Niamh Bhreathnach, published a White Paper.  Within the confines of that paper we speculated on how we would manage a decline in the number of primary school pupils.  There are 450,000 primary school pupils in 3,300 schools.  According to the most recent census forecast, by 2025, 17 years from now, that population will grow to a maximum of 650,000 and will have a minimum of an extra 100,000 on the current figures.  I do not refer only to the outlying growth areas around the greater Dublin area, Cork or Limerick.  Existing schools are confronted by growth within their areas because of the surge in population.  Only 10% of the growth is being generated by newcomer children, whose parents are coming to this country to work in our economy and who we are trying to integrate into our society.The current system of operation in the Department of Education and Science is no longer fit for purpose.  Due to commitments related to the Lisbon treaty I could not attend last night's debate but I read the Minister's reply to my colleague in Fine Gael with responsibility for education, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Will the Minister tell someone in the Department of Education and Science to turn off the word processor and stop telling us how good he is and about the increases in moneys?  The increases are not catching up or maintaining pace with the increases in the pupil population.  I invite anyone in the Chamber and the Visitors Gallery to read the reply.  If the Minister does not provide the increase in teachers' pay and relate this to the increase in spending and inflation, the real value of any increase must be considerably discounted.  The primary education system of allocation of teachers does not work.  For teachers of mainstream classes including children with special needs the challenging behaviour of the pupil cannot be accommodated because the special educational needs officer report and the psychological report has not been accepted and therefore the special needs assistant has not be allocated.  This means primary school teachers must cope with pupils of challenging behaviour that is disruptive to the rest of the pupils.The promise on pupil-teacher ratios, which the Government has reneged on, has become more critical.  There is a dispute among educationalists as to whether pupil-teacher ratio is the be all and end all.  In principle and as a parent I accept the idea of mainstreaming children with disability but it places an additional burden on primary school teachers if the numbers are kept high.  The automatic guillotine that kicks in is crude and disruptive to schools and requires all sorts of internal management.The Minister suggested yesterday that this has nothing to do with the Department of Education and Science, that individual schools make choices and that having 30 children in one classroom and 20 in another is a decision made by the school for which the Minister has no responsibility.  That is dumping responsibility for the Minister's decision on the boards of management and the principals who struggle to provide education in the classroom as well as finding money to pay for water charges.I welcome the appointment of the Minister and invite him to return to the drawing board and examine the crisis he has inherited.  As The Irish Times stated a few days ago, we cannot have a knowledge-based economy in the future, with millions spent on PhDs if our primary schools are so decrepit that the Minister cannot tell me how many prefab classrooms we have in our primary school system, two months after I asked the question.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for raising this issue.  Just two weeks ago the ESRI published a report suggesting that in future our economic well-being will depend more than anything else on our investment in education, because rather than selling our manual labour, we will sell our brain power.  Children are entitled to learn in classes of reasonable size and in classrooms that are orderly, unstressed and uncrowded.  Because Fianna Fáil has reneged on its promise to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 27:1 per class next September, 28 schools will lose one or more teachers.I refer to two schools on this list, one urban and one rural.  St. Francis Xavier School in Roselawn, Castleknock, in Dublin 15 is threatened with the loss of one to two teachers next September.  This school is both successful and popular.  More than 25% of the pupils are international students, many with specific English language coaching requirements.  In the junior school, from which the senior school pupils are recruited, the proportion of international students is even higher.  This school is now faced with the loss of two teachers.  Had the Minister for Education and Science and Fianna Fáil in Government honoured promises to cut class sizes, they would not be losing staff.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Because of the number of international students, there are a number of additional posts in the school, particularly for language and resource teaching.  The school is one hour short of the 22 hours required for a learning resource teacher.  The bungling and red tape between the HSE and the Department of Education and Science means the school cannot get the extra hour that has been approved in principle.This problem is not exclusive to our cities.  Scoil Naomh Pádraig in Ballymurphy in County Carlow is a rural school that expects to take in 11 extra pupils next September.  It too is facing the loss of its third teacher because of the Minister's U-turn on class sizes.  Both of these schools expect a significant expansion in pupil intake for next September, yet they will be penalised with respect to last September's figures.  This is no way to plan the educational future of our children, the teachers who work in our schools or the parents who turn out to support our schools.  These are just two of the 28 schools with similar stories.  This is no way to plan schooling in urban areas and no way to support rural schools.I regret the Green Party is absent from the debate.

In some cases their policies were included in the programme for Government.  What is it all worth if schools are thrown into crisis, facing disruption in rural areas through splitting classes?  In the crowded classroom environment in rapidly developing urban areas such as west Dublin, Meath and Kildare, one third of classes have more than 31 pupils and some have up to 35.This is another issue the Minister might address.  The Minister's predecessor buried the statistics on class sizes.  As a former teacher in this appointment, can the Minister release the up to date figures for class sizes for every school in the country?  These figures are collected by school principals and are submitted to the Department.  The Government has problems with IT but counting the number of children in each class and releasing the information is not difficult.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I remain hopeful.The Minister spoke at length last night about the positive difference we have made to the education system.  I believe we have delivered and will continue to do so.  The Government has delivered 2,000 extra teachers in less than two years.  Some €9.3 billion is being provided for education this year, a 70% increase since 2002.  This level of investment is bringing tangible results via €600 million for school buildings and a doubling of the 2004 expenditure on special education.The programme for Government provides a clear commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000.  This will enable us to make further progress in reducing class sizes.  It further sets out a revised basis for the 2010-11 school year of an allocation based on an average of 24 pupils.  I welcome and look forward to this being realised.  We have always placed education at the top of our agenda and we recognise the need to invest at every stage of the education process to ensure we have well-educated young adults who develop the necessary social and academic skills required to live in an ever-changing world.  Without teachers, this process cannot be completed.It is fundamental that it go forth from this debate that there will be a net increase of almost 500 teachers this year.  Five times as many schools are expected to employ an additional teacher due to an increase in enrolments.  The Opposition's political opportunism belies the underlying issue of its wanting us to give preferential treatment to some schools. This would have the knock-on effect of having no objective criteria for staffing schedules in our schools.  A school which believes it has been treated unfairly under the schedule has a right to appeal.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department of Education and Science.There are many issues and challenges facing the education system going forward.  For example, we must meet the challenge of increasing numbers of new children entering our primary and secondary schools.  The creation of the ministry for integration policy under the stewardship of Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is a positive step in this regard.The Government has surpassed its commitment to provide 1,800 language support teachers in primary and secondary schools.  Children whose first language is not English are at an inherent disadvantage and the Government is committed to neutralising this weakness and allowing them to flourish and achieve their potential.  Furthermore, this diversity in our student population will, I believe, strengthen the education of our Irish children.  The intangible benefits of acceptance of multiculturalism or expanding one's knowledge of different languages will lead to a stronger, diverse and more vibrant school population.A similar noteworthy point is that there has seen significant targeted investment in additional supports for children and young people from disadvantaged communities, and rightly so.  In 2008, some €800 million is being provided for such initiatives at all levels of the education system, a 75% increase on the figure for 2003.  Under the DEIS action plan, primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities will benefit from a wide range of extra resources including smaller classes, school meals, intensive literacy and numeracy programmes and additional day-to-day funding.  They are also in receipt of home-school-community liaison and school completion services.  This is the reality of what Fianna Fáil in Government is doing on the ground.

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	442	Yes, and the Progressive Democrats.We are putting resources into disadvantaged areas which is what we must do.Another factor which contributes to improved student outcome is basing our teaching promotions on merit.  Promotions based on seniority alone should be left in the last century where they once flourished.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	443	That is yesterday's speech.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	444	Hard-working, diligent teachers must be provided with a pathway of progression in their workplace.  Access to appropriate support and training, together with a constant drive to upgrade, update and continually improve as a teacher, will lead to a more rewarding career and to more effective outcomes for our young people passing through the education system.  We must continue to attract the right people into teaching and, when we have done so, we must continue to provide them with every available opportunity for professional development to ensure they are effective educators.  Teacher quality is the single most important factor in improving outcomes.  The number of teachers relative to students is but one of many variables affecting the quality of education provision.We must acknowledge that we cannot work or seek further funding for education in a vacuum.  It is not possible in the current economic climate to solve all the outstanding issues with the stroke of a pen.  We must cut our cloth according to our measure.  The programme for Government is a five-year programme and one cannot realistically expect all goals to be achieved in the first year.  We are experiencing a changed economic climate as are many economies at this time.  We know that economies go through cyclical phases and Ireland is no different.  It is important we manage the challenges that this presents.No Department or Minister will ever have enough money and this Minister for Education and Science and his Department are no different.  However, they are not alone.  The Departments of Health and Children, Transport, Social and Family Affairs, to name but a few, would also like more funding.  We must accept that we have finite resources.  We cannot have sound management of public finances and continue to spend extra money without identifying priorities.  We must spend according to our means.  To do otherwise would be reckless and would have serious ramifications for the future.I am confident that this Minister and this Government will continue to build on the major achievements in education and will do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.  We must not lose sight of the need to be student-centred at all times.  This must be at the heart of all our objectives.  I have every confidence in the Minister's ability and commitment to deliver on the priorities set out in the programme for Government in the lifetime of this Government.  I am happy to support the amendment.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this motion, particularly because the Opposition mentioned a school in my constituency, Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh, Laytown.  Since I became an elected representative I have visited this school more than any other in my constituency.  I know the school as well as anyone.The fact remains that massive numbers of extra teachers will come into the system this year.  Schools in my constituency are gaining teachers, and rightly so, due to increased enrolment of students.  I am sure Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa in Laytown will gain extra teachers given the increase in pupils attending the school this year.  In addition, a full complement of teachers will be appointed to the new primary school in Laytown.  It is quite likely there will be approximately 20 or 25 new teachers at post-primary and primary level in my constituency this September.  This is a fact that has been ignored by the Opposition.  Massive progress has been made.  More than 2,000 teachers are being provided in primary schools in the school years 2007-08 and 2008-09.  One would honestly think the system was collapsing and that schools are losing teachers and not able to put classes together.I recognise teachers and parents are in the Gallery.  They do a fantastic job, particularly in Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh in Laytown.  The facts regarding this school are that it is losing a teacher and it would prefer not to lose a teacher.  I would also prefer if it did not lose the teacher.  However, it will have a net decrease of 30 or 40 pupils enrolling this year because of the new school in Laytown.  Although it would be preferable to keep the teacher, the person in question is retiring and it is not a case of someone being let go.The Labour Party spoke about the Green Party being absent from the debate and I am glad Deputy Mary White is here.  The Labour Party completely absented itself from the Laytown schools crisis.  The only Opposition Deputy with any role in it was Deputy Shane McEntee of Fine Gael.  He played an important role and I acknowledge it.

Most of the other schools in question are not in my constituency.  This school would prefer to hire a teacher to replace the retiring teacher but it is not the end of the world or a crisis and it is unfair of the Opposition to imply this is the case.Major progress is being made with €380 million extra this year for teachers' pay and pensions.  This is not an insignificant amount of money.  It is a substantial amount of money to provide teachers where they are needed and ensure schools in developing areas and anywhere else with increasing numbers are provided with the teachers required.With regard to Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh in Laytown, the Minister may be aware that an issue arose as it temporarily housed Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa on its grounds.  The temporary prefabs erected during the crisis have been removed and Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa has a new building and will have a permanent building soon.  However, the foundations and remains of some of the temporary buildings are still there.I know the Minister is working on approving the funding to clear up the yard.  Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh played a major role in accommodating Scoil Oilibhéir Naofa under extremely difficult circumstances.  It gave up its gym and most of the yard.  Will the Minister look favourably on the representations being made and allocate the cash to clean up the yard?  The school did a fantastic job and the people involved were extremely helpful under difficult circumstances.  They do not want to be down a teacher but it is not the crisis the Opposition is making out and there are far more serious issues with regard to school buildings——

The Green Party also ensured the programme for Government's commitment to long-term funding for the 12 centres in the ABA pilot scheme.While nobody could have predicted the recent economic turbulence resulting from worldwide credit crunches and the sub-prime mortgage crises and the implications such faraway events would have on our Exchequer, €100 million extra will be spent this year over last year's levels on service developments in education.  While Fine Gael and the Labour Party may berate the Government because not every school in the country has every resource and capacity it ought to have, I remind Deputy Brian Hayes that in Fine Gael's promises made last year, it apportioned €300 million extra to new service developments based, I presume, on its forecast for economic growth and revenue figures.  The level Fine Gael wanted to spend was less than that demanded by the Green Party.

We will not hear it speak about the €586 million being spent this year on the school buildings programme, including the completion of work on 48 large-scale primary schools projects——

The Opposition will also fail to mention the fact that the Minister told the House last night that the Government is well on target to provide 4,000 new primary teachers during its lifetime.One of the schools listed in the Opposition's motion is close to my own heart and perhaps to Deputy Burton, that of Ballymurphy national school underneath the Blackstairs Mountains in County Carlow, a most beautiful rural school.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	472	The school was given a principal and two mainstream teachers for 2007 to 2008 because of an enrolment of 49 pupils in September 2006.  These figures are significant.  Unfortunately, the enrolment in September last year was 47 and next year the school will have only a principal and one mainstream class teacher.  In the case of Ballymurphy, I know there is the possibility of retaining the third teacher through the provisions made for developing school posts.  I hope the Department, the Minister and his partners in Government will work hard with the school to provide this developing school post.I note what the Minister had to say last evening about issues to do with teacher numbers in schools and I welcome his openness to any debate on the changes we might have to the overall schedule for allocating teachers.  My view is that a certain humanity must be incorporated into the system of teacher numbers and while consistency with the rules is important, the drive to reduce class sizes will only be maintained by being realistic about schools in terms of numbers.  I acknowledge the role to be played by the staffing appeals board in these matters and I trust the Minister will ensure the operation of this board is underpinned by realism and compassion.This has been a good debate in the House on education.  The Opposition can rest assured that my party will not get complacent about putting the necessary resources into primary, secondary and tertiary education.

I know the Minister will be helpful when I approach him with regard to education.We have educational problems in Dublin South-West, like everywhere else.  The Minister knows of my concern with regard to the need for the acceleration of the building programme at the Holy Rosary primary school in Ballycragh, which is a major local issue.  A building programme is scheduled to be developed at Scoil Chaitlín Maude in Killinarden.  The Minister knows I live in Springfield.  My local primary school, St. Mark's, has more than 1,000 pupils, half of whom are from 40 different countries.  As previous speakers said, this presents challenges and I hope the Minister will give them attention.As is traditional on these occasions, I compliment my constituency colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on the issue he has raised.  I read his contribution a few times and I was impressed by the soundbite in the final paragraph.  He was dreaming when he wondered what Government Deputies would do because he knows what we will do.  On the odd occasion in my first five years in the House I wanted to be on the Opposition benches where one can relax, have a little moan and one does not have to worry about much.  However, I am happy on the Government benches.Deputy Brian Hayes was kind enough to mention one of my local schools near where he lives, St. Killian's in Kingswood, and I am not afraid to discuss the school.  Following the 2002 election, there was a major issue about the building programme in our area and all of us co-operated.  I did not take my eye off the ball and I remained focused on what needed to be achieved.  I approached the Minister for Education and Science every other day about that issue.  I brought her to the estate and I showed her the difficulties.  I am glad that when economic circumstances improved during the last Dáil, the Government ensured those works were completed.  The school is a tremendous example of what can be achieved.Like many other schools on the INTO list, which Deputy Brian Hayes highlighted, it faces challenges.  The Minister will not be offended if I raise those issues.  I am concerned about all the schools in my area and about educational disadvantage.  One of the problems faced by schools such as St. Killian's in Kingswood is they are not considered disadvantaged under the Department's criteria in this regard.  For example, they are not located on an island or in the Gaeltacht and they are not all-Irish schools.  Such schools benefit from hugely preferential pupil-teacher ratios and additional teaching and financial resources.  St. Killian's does not enjoy such advantages and this has created significant resentment among the parents and the local community.  The Minister must make sure such communities and schools do not believe they are being disadvantaged.  Other colleagues have outlined similar examples.I do not have time to rattle off the details regarding every other school but staffing of mainstream classes is allocated on a previous September basis.  The number of mainstream teachers for September 2008 will be based on enrolments on 30 September 2007.  On that date, St. Killian's in Kingwood had 284 pupils whereas now it has 285.  This creates a difficulty.  I acknowledge the comments of other colleagues and the arguments that have been put forward.  We are all entitled to make the case for our local schools and there will always be cases to be made but if we examine particular examples, they show up the problem and the solution.I wish the Minister well as he wrestles with these problems.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle had an enjoyable day, as it is a special day for him.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an tAire nua, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, agus an Aire Stáit, Deputy Séan Haughey.  Go n-éirí leo san obair thábhachtach.I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this issue, which is close to my heart.  I represent Dublin North, one of the fastest growing constituencies in Ireland if not in Europe.  No one can deny there is always room for improvement in the education system.  It will never be perfect and we will always need to work on it to ensure progress and advancement.  The Government and its predecessors have tried to commit themselves to the best education system, which is best illustrated by the aggressive building programme undertaken since 2002 with massive spending in this area over that period, which has resulted in a reduction in class sizes.  The Minister outlined the Government's achievements last night.This year more than €9.3 billion will be spent on education, with €600 million allocated to the schools building programme.  The allocation for teachers' pay and pension is €4.6 billion, not an insignificant amount.  Staff numbers have reduced in a number of the schools listed in the motion.  I was surprised St. Patrick's junior school, Skerries, in my constituency lost a teacher but when I investigated this, I discovered the school enrolment had reduced from 360 in 2004 to 339 in September 2007.  On the basis of the 27:1 ratio, this resulted in the reduction in staff numbers.  However, the ratio works both ways.  When enrolments have increased, teachers have been appointed and the statistics back this up.I was surprised the enrolment in St. Patrick's had reduced because over the past year my colleagues and myself fought for a new school in the northern end of Skerries and, thankfully, the Government approved a new Educate Together school in the Kelly's Bay area.  In my region, six new schools will come on stream next September.

It may be difficult for the Opposition to accept substantial progress is being made.It should be recognised at least 120 teachers are going back into the system to take up positions in schools that are expanding.  As my colleague, Deputy Conlon, stated, a staffing appeals board was established and it met for the first time this month.  This independent mechanism is available to schools that find themselves in the predicament of losing a teacher.  The boards of management of such schools should make an appeal and, hopefully, their cases will be well heard.The new schools coming on stream in my constituency are as follows: Educate Together in Kelly's Bay, Skerries; Educate Together, Applewood, north Swords; two primary schools and a secondary school in Castlelands, Balbriggan; Gaelscoil Ros Eo in Rush; and the Rush-Lusk Educate Together school, which has been relocated to a new site on Raheny Lane, Lusk.

St. George's national school in Balbriggan has been awarded band 1 status, giving it priority funding to expand to an eight-teacher school to meet the needs of the Protestant community in the area.The population of north Dublin has exploded, especially in the traditional small rural towns of Swords, Balbriggan and Skerries.  The Government has met the needs of the expanding communities in the list of works I outlined.  I thank the different Ministers involved.

Listening to the Government speakers tonight, one would swear there was no problem.  A common theme emerging is that the Government cannot deliver in a year.  It gave a commitment in the programme for Government that it would reduce the pupil-teacher ratio from 27 to 26 by 30 September.  Once again, it has reneged on that promise.In the 2002 programme for Government, the Government gave a commitment that children under the age of nine would be taught in classes with fewer than 20 students.  In my constituency in Limerick, 85% of schools have children in classes with more than 20 students.  Once again, the Government has totally reneged on a commitment.I welcome Bill Reidy, the principal of JFK Memorial School in Limerick, as well as parents and pupils who travelled up here tonight to show how important it is to the principal, teaching staff and students in this school.  I have four children in national school.  Two of them are in classes of more than 35 children, while the other two are in classes with fewer than 30 children.  I asked them what difference being in a class of 35 made because I believe that children will best represent it.  They said that the teachers have to spend most of their time controlling the class, the weaker students are not looked after and the average student can fall through the cracks.  Education is the gateway for people to get on in life.  Shame on Fianna Fáil and this Government for not dealing with something so fundamental.

Ten years ago, we petitioned to reduce class sizes.  Here I am today pushing the same case.  We will not let this go.  The Government will have to honour its commitment and, particularly in respect of JFK Memorial School in Limerick, ensure that the 11th teacher is retained.  It is vital.There is a very simple solution.  There is an independent appeals board whose terms of reference are totally confined.

This is the key issue.  If we had a little bit of imagination and practicality, we would have a situation where these 28 schools that are about to lose a teacher would not lose one.  It is ludicrous.The most that is involved here is probably €1.5 million.  I did a rough calculation before I came out.  To put this in context, the Ministers and the Taoiseach will get the bones of €800,000 plus in terms of increases which they are unwilling to set aside.  That is putting it in its context.  It is small money but one cannot quantify the long-term consequences for children.  I guarantee that if Government Deputies went home at night and asked their spouse or partner how he or she felt about the fact that their child was in a class of 35, he or she would say they wanted it changed.  They are being sanctimonious in saying that the Government is doing something on this.  It is doing absolutely nothing.

This has been going on for the past six years.  The Government came in with a proposal to reduce it below 20 in 2002 for children under the age of nine.  It introduced something that was not great but at least gave an incremental reduction of one per year between 2007 and 2012.  What has the Government done here?  It has reneged on its commitment, which it needs to honour.I will be looking for the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Ministers to come with us on this.  This is above politics; it is about the future of our children and Ireland.  The issue here is about the retention of that extra teacher.  Shame on the Government.

Fine Gael has been forced to bring this motion to the House to prevent 28 primary schools from losing teachers.In the programme for Government in 2002, it was stated that within five years, the Government would introduce maximum class guidelines which would ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1.  In the programme for Government, the Government set out its pledge to reduce class sizes to one teacher for 26 children by September 2008.  The Government has broken this promise and, instead, the Minister for Education and Science has instructed 28 primary schools to sack a teacher.  As a result, 28 primary schools around the country will suffer.  In my constituency of Dublin North-East, two schools are affected — St. Peter and Paul's boys' national school in Baldoyle and St. Kevin's junior national school in Donaghmede.St. Kevin's junior national school will lose a teacher in the upcoming school year.  The school will now consist of four classes which will mean the amalgamation of the present junior infants to make a class of 35.  This class includes six children for whom English is not their first language, one child with diagnosed special needs and children with mixed abilities.This is an unworkable situation and a complete fiasco.  To have 35 students in one class is outrageous and totally unacceptable. How can these students achieve their full potential in a class of 35 pupils?  This Government is actually increasing class sizes in some schools instead of the promised reduction.  A fully equipped classroom is available in St. Kevin's junior national school which will now sadly lie idle because of the latest round of cutbacks.  The pupils are present; all that is needed now is a teacher.The loss of a teacher at St. Peter and Paul's boys' national school in Baldoyle will leave 29 junior infants in one class and 38 boys in another class.  Having an extra teacher would have facilitated an extra junior infants' class, a situation which had previously been enacted.  This would enable the younger children to obtain a proper introduction into school life in a smaller classroom setting.  How can these pupils now get a decent start when their progress is to be hindered in a class of 38?  In October 2007, the school predicted that a slight decrease in pupil enrolment would occur in the next school year.  However, since then, there has been a vast increase in school numbers and there will now be even more students in the school next year.  I ask the Minister for Education and Science to re-examine the change in enrolment numbers with a view to reinstating the teacher at St. Peter and Paul's boys' national school.A good education is a vital requirement in society today.  Primary school students need individual attention and small class sizes in order to develop.  Large class sizes, which are the norm in this country, are leading to students losing out and are placing enormous pressure on all teachers affected.  The average class size across OECD countries is 22 students per teacher, while the average class size in the EU is 20.3 students per teacher.  In Ireland, the average class size is 24.3 students per teacher, which is certainly not good enough.  Ireland only spends 4.6% of its GDP on education compared to the OECD average of 5.5%.  If we are serious about education, according to a professor of education at NUI Maynooth, the Government needs to spend 7% of our GDP on education; an increase in funding would certainly enable the deficiencies in education to be addressed.The Government has underfunded education in this country.  In recent times, the plight suffered by many schools has been highlighted in the media.  Springdale national school in Raheny is just one of a number of schools that has been on a waiting list for a new school building for nearly ten years.  Pupils and teachers are working in Third World conditions and still have not received a date for the new school building.The Minister for Education and Science has stated that these latest cutbacks are due to the current economic and budgetary environment.  I refuse to accept this.  Two days ago, the Government announced it will plough €400 million into research funding for universities.  I ask the Minister to get his priorities right and to hold back the necessary funding to allow the 28 primary schools affected to retain their teachers.  Fine Gael has tabled this motion to put the Government under pressure to ensure that these 28 schools do not lose a teacher.  I call on the new Minister for Education and Science to urgently revisit this decision and to reinstate the teachers.  I also ask all Members of the House to support this motion.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Like my colleagues, I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes, the Fine Gael spokesperson on education, on tabling this motion, which is both appropriate and timely.  I listened with a growing feeling of nausea last night to the Minister for Education and Science as he accused my party of political opportunism.  I am not quite sure what that means but my definition of political opportunism is a political party which, for personal electoral gain, misleads people at election time. What we are engaged in is not political opportunism.  We are seeking to call a Government to account for making false promises that affect schools all over the country.I wish to deal with the situation in one particular school in my constituency and briefly refer to other schools which are experiencing difficulties of a similar nature.  Scoil Colmcille Naofa in Knocklyon is one of the biggest primary schools in the country.  At the hands of this Government it has, in the past six months, suffered what could be best described as a double-whammy.  We have gone through a piece of theatre in successive general elections in the Dublin South constituency.  In 2002, St. Colmcille's in Knocklyon was promised a new school because 500 of the 1,500 pupils in it had been occupying prefabricated buildings for far too many years.  The same promise was recirculated in 2007 and the accompanying promise, given across the length and breadth of the country, was that there would be a reduction in class size.  When it comes to education, particularly primary education, we all know that size matters.  It matters particularly with regard to children getting the education to which they are entitled and teachers working in an environment which allows them to use their talents to best effect for the benefit of children.St. Colmcille's school will be denied a teacher in September, a teacher who is working there at present.  St. Colmcille's, perhaps naively — if it was naive, so was the rest of the education sector — believed the Government when it said it would have a 26:1 ratio and operated some forward planning to determine how it would deal with that in the context of the term starting next September.  The school intended to turn six classes at junior infant level into seven.  As a result of losing a teacher, 26 families who had expected their children to start junior infants in September await, disappointed.  In addition to being faced with their children starting a year later than they had anticipated, they are now also possibly faced with the additional and unexpected cost of child care.It is grossly unfair to this school.  I welcome representatives from the school who are in the Public Gallery this evening.  It is grossly unfair to them to deprive the school of a teacher.  It is also grossly unfair that a false promise that they would have a new school resulted, in November 2007, in the Government stopping the school from seeking planning permission.  That school is now condemned to keep its pupils for an undefined number of years in prefabricated buildings, as are a series of other schools in south Dublin.  From Leopardstown to Marley to Ballyroan and Loretto in Rathfarnham, children are in prefabricated buildings that are long past their sell-by date.I ask that for once Government Deputies who treat education seriously support this motion.  This motion deserves support.  Our children deserve the best possible education and they do not deserve to be betrayed by false promises made by opportunistic politicians at election time.

The Minister last night described the winners and losers in the lottery that is the annual allocation of staff in the primary sector.  The system is archaic and is causing massive disruption to our national schools on an annual basis.  A school that is one student under the requirement loses a teacher.  Is this how any successful business organisation would conduct its affairs?There are many schools in County Clare that experience this unnecessary pressure.  The Minister must address the areas that are experiencing significant population growth, not just in Dublin, but in large population centres and their hinterlands, such as Ennis, County Clare, which has the following primary schools: Ennis national school,  Ennis Christian Brothers primary school, Scoil Chríost Rí in Cloughleigh, The Holy Family, Ennis Educate Together, the Gaelscoil, Clarecastle, Barefield, Knockanean, Scoil na Mainstreach, Quin, Ballyea and Doora.The systems for planning in education need a major overhaul.  The Minister must revisit how the Government provides primary education from an infrastructural and a staffing point of view.  I attended several meetings about class size in County Clare before the last general election.  Indeed, every Deputy in this House did so.  It is most regrettable that the Minister is standing over the pupils of Ireland being the first casualties of the Government's cutbacks.  During the first weeks of this new Administration we heard many references to Irish political history.  I remind the Minister that one of his predecessors, Mr. Donogh O'Malley, took the bull by the horns in 1967 and introduced free secondary education, thus enabling and empowering a whole generation of Irish people.  Where are we 40 years later?

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	505	We have classrooms bursting at the seams, chronic underfunding of schools, prefab after prefab, parents fundraising to pay for basic necessities, such as windows and doors, the discontinuation of the summer works programme, the imposition of water charges and the long, never-ending list of children awaiting assessment for the much-needed services of a special needs assistant.Ireland's economy will suffer greatly if the Government does not have regard for primary education.  At the heart of this is the need to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  Before last year's general election, Fianna Fáil promised that class size would be addressed but it has failed.  It has failed the children of Ireland.  The rhetoric of association with those who truly had public service at heart is all fine and well.  Talk is very easy, paper does not refuse ink and microphones do not refuse soundbites.  With this Government, led by the Taoiseach, we could be dealing with a busted flush.  It is short-sighted of the Government to continue to ignore class size.  It is also a betrayal of future generations, given that it is internationally acknowledged that higher achievements by pupils is directly related to the numbers in classes, which is of particular importance at primary level.  If we cannot educate children properly at primary level with a low pupil-teacher ratio as a cornerstone, we immediately place them at a disadvantage.  Then the State is faced with trying to play catch-up throughout their time in the educational system.The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, was put to the top of the class by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and I congratulate him on that.  I ask him to take a different stance from the one adopted by the previous Minister for Education and Science and to deal with the issue of class size.  I urge him to reduce class sizes and to deliver on the commitments that he and all Fianna Fáil Deputies gave to the people of Ireland.  I commend the motion to the House.

I hope that in four years' time the parents and teachers of Ireland will recognise the work he is doing on their behalf and that what happened last year will never happen again.  I have a list of schools before me, including those in Moynalty, Julianstown and Rathfeigh, which were promised in March last year that new schools would be built and so forth.  According to the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, we do not have the money to do it now.  In four years' time, such promises will be made again.I wish to address the former Minister's legacy in Laytown.  For any school to be functional, it needs good accommodation, adequate staff and sports facilities.  These are what we are without in Laytown.  There is no school and there are no staff and no sports facilities.  I am delighted that Minister is gone from office, as are the people of Meath.  She basically filled them with false promises and then did a runner.  I hope the new Minister will take a trip to County Meath to see the mess left by the previous Minister.Two years ago when there was uproar about provision of classrooms in a school in Laytown, the solution put forward by Fianna Fáil and the other representatives in office was to put the children on a bus, bring them to where Paul Carberry and Barry Geraghty were the day before and accommodate them in the weighing room at a racecourse.  The people made a decision on that.  That is why Deputy Thomas Byrne and myself were taken on board to address the matter.  That is perhaps why Deputy Byrne was elected, and rightly so, given that he worked hard in this respect.However, I object to the false promises that were made.  We are dealing with pupils and teachers.  I would not want the job of teacher.  To ask them to handle 24 children is bad enough, but they are being asked to teach classes of 33 or 34 and to educate them properly.  That is simply not on.

Now that the general election is over the projects are no further advanced.However, class size is an issue.  The money spent on providing prefabs would be better spent on borrowing capital on which interest could be paid to provide proper school buildings in which pupils could be taught properly rather than having to go from prefab to prefab for classes.If the people continue to follow the work Deputy Brian Hayes is doing, in four years they might recognise that the most important issue in the country is the education of our young people.  While the money available is tight, the money that is being spent on prefabs would be better spent on the provision of proper school buildings.I commend the motion to the House and hope the Fianna Fáil members representing County Meath, whose people have had a difficult time in this regard, will side with Fine Gael in voting on it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I appreciate the opportunity to address the motion.  I join my colleagues in complimenting Deputy Brian Hayes and the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party on proposing this motion and the Labour Party on supporting it.I speak on behalf of the 28 schools that stand to lose a teacher, in particular St. Francis Xavier national school in my constituency.  It is the school I attended and am grateful for the education I got there.  It stands to lose two teachers, at least one of whom could be saved if this motion were adopted.One or two of the many commitments in the programme for Government are clearly set out.  The commitment in this respect is clearly stated.  Not only did the Government commit to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio from 27:1 to 24:1 by 2010, it committed specifically to do so by one point every year.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	517	That is correct.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The Government is engaging specifically in breaching a promise by refusing to do that.  I understand that provision was written into the programme for Government at the express demand of the Green Party.  It is disappointing that none of the three Green Party Ministers has addressed this motion.  It is clear that never in history has a party prostituted itself as cheaply as the Green Party, or sold out so much and made so many promises and delivered so few.I would like to address the OECD report on public sector reform, which is interesting.  It deals at length with public sector reform.  This is a good example of it.  The rigidity that works in school systems is making education almost impossible.  Where a requirement of 21 hours must be met to allow the allocation of a fully qualified teacher for children with special needs, it cannot be met if the number of hours is only 20 and the school cannot be allocated that teacher.  Similarly, in a case where an additional teacher will be allocated in a school where the pupil-teacher ratio is 26:1, it cannot be the case that an additional teacher will not be allocated if the pupil-teacher ratio falls to 25:1.  Some of the proposals made by the OECD need to be adopted and schools, principals and boards of management need to be given much more autonomy in managing their budgets.  Such rigidity from the Department cannot be imposed on schools as if we were living in Soviet times.  Schools must be allowed to manage their budgets better.Fundamentally this issue is about money and choices.  The amount involved is €1.4 million, which is not a great deal of money.  The Government should consider its choices.  Instead of spending that amount, it is deciding to give 35 Ministers pay increases which will cost €1.05 million.  It is proposing to spend €2 million on climate change advertisements, which some Members may have seen on television carrying the message, "change the world, this is your world" or something like that.  The Government has chosen to spend €8 million on a secondary school site and €3 million on a primary school site both in my constituency, which it could have got for free in the same way it could get open space for free if it were to change the planning laws.  It is spending €3 million on a Transport 21 advertising campaign to tell us that it is spending many billions on Transport 21 — that is just great.  We have already shown how the Government could save €50 million by reforming State agencies.  The Ministers opposite have 100 civil servants working in their constituency offices.  If they gave up the equivalent of a half a civil servant that would be all they would have to do to save the loss of these teachers.A fundamental issue I should address as the spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment is that of the economy.  We are entering a different phase of economic development and to survive in these new and changing times two areas on which we cannot cut back are infrastructure and education.  If the Government penny pinches with education to the extent that it will not deliver €1.4 million, a tiny amount of money, the cost of that further down the line will be phenomenal.  The jobs that will exist here in ten or 15 years will be skilled ones.  We cannot afford to have a country in which all our citizens, including our children, are not educated and do not have qualifications.  That is really what this motion is about.I commend it to the House.  I hope the Fianna Fáil Deputies, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan will vote in favour on it.  This is not simply about cutting back in terms of a little money, it is fundamentally about our economic future.  It is important that is understood.  Cutbacks in education will cost us much more in ten or 15 years' time.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I thank my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, for bringing forward this motion on the reduction of staff numbers at specific schools.  I want to strongly make the case for adding Castleblayney girls school to that list in light of the fact it will not only lose one teacher but two.  I understand this school, which has already been classified as disadvantaged, may be down up to ten pupils which under the current regulations will mean it will automatically lose a teacher.  However, this in turn will mean the principal will have to become a class teacher again, leading to an actual loss of two teachers.  Under the DEIS structures, the principal is supposed to attend a number of meetings outside the school and this will now be virtually impossible as she has to manage a staff of eight.  I urge that the case of this school be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Under the DEIS scheme, the principal delivers breakfast clubs, hot lunch clubs and after school activities, which are important in this type of area.Some 18 months ago the Oireachtas Members of Cavan-Monaghan were invited to meet the INTO personnel in Urbleshanny national school.  While only Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin and myself turned up, I will always remember the case put forward by the spokesperson, the late Peter McGrane, and the fact that we were shown around the classrooms where one teacher was trying to deal with 37 students and others were not far behind in that regard.  When I rang that school today I was advised in no uncertain terms that nothing has changed in spite of this Government's general election promises.  While the largest class currently is 35, there will be an increase in the number of students next September, making the pupil-teacher ratio even worse.I spoke to people in quite a few other schools who are in a similar position, but the greatest problem in areas such as Monaghan is the significant number of non-English speaking students, never mind those with a handicap or disadvantage.  Classes of more than 30 students are impossible to manage in that situation.  As one teacher pointed out to me, a child with minor difficulties is at least equivalent to two children while a child with major difficulties is the equivalent of dealing with five children.Added to all of that is the serious difficulty in having a child assessed to ensure that proper backup services are obtained, as every effort is being made by the Department to minimise the number of classroom assistants.  Even when children are assessed, the assessment often comes back in statement form to the effect that, for instance, there is a tendency towards dyslexia rather than stating the child actually has the problem.It is vital that the Government, as a first step, ensures no teacher is removed from any school and that a genuine effort is made to reach the goal put forward at election time.  No teacher or parent expects this to be done instantly, but they do expect a genuine movement in this direction.  The lack of effort on school buildings and other issues in recent times is deplorable and must be improved.

The Deputies on the opposite side of the House have taken the opportunity to raise the plight of individual schools in their constituencies, which is what they must do as public representatives.  However, I would like to put the debate in the context of the overall situation relating to education and funding by the Department.As the Minister said yesterday, the priority the Government attaches to providing quality education is evident from the fact that the education budget has increased by more than 70% since 2002 to over €9.3 billion this year.  I reject the comments made by Deputy McEntee.  The former Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, presided over a number of these years, from 2002 until this year, and has a number of achievements to her credit.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	522	For more than a decade, Fianna Fáil-led Governments have dramatically increased the number of teachers in primary schools to meet a series of objectives, including reducing class size, providing improved staffing ratios, meeting the needs of pupils from socio-economic disadvantaged areas, supporting children with special needs and supporting the language needs of new children.  Since 2002, there are approximately 6,000 more teachers on the Department's pay roll.  In the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years additional teachers were allocated, specifically to reduce class sizes.  There can be no doubt about where the Government stands on primary education.This debate has exposed further double speak from the Opposition benches.  Fine Gael makes repeated calls for additional spending on education and other public services, but at the same time criticises the Government for its management of public expenditure.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	524	All programme for Government commitments to improve public services, including those relating to class size, are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and on the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  This was pointed out at the time of the general election.Any discussions on serious issues are devalued if inaccurate statements are made in an attempt to be sensational.  I accept that representative groups such as the INTO can legitimately hold a view that even more teachers should have been allocated this year to enable progress on reducing class size.  For cynical reasons, and in an obvious attempt to sensationalise the issue, Fine Gael has gone further and even attacked the mechanism of the staffing schedule.  The schedule remains a transparent and clear way of ensuring that all schools are treated consistently and fairly and that they know where they stand.  It is, also, agreed by the social partners.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Stick to the motion.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I know Fine Gael likes to continually interrupt Government speakers.  It does not do democracy any good not to let speakers, on all sides, to be heard.The staffing situation relating to an individual situation can be picked out, but whether the allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher or is reduced further, ultimately schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country, there will always be differences in individual class sizes.  If one school has a class of 35 while another school with the same number of pupils and teachers avoids having a class that big, the first question to ask is what could be done differently by the school concerned.I remind the House that even with the emergence, in the latter half of 2007, of a much more challenging economic climate, the education budget was prioritised by the Government and given an increase of 8% in budget 2008.  It was an increase of that order that enabled the allocation of over 2,000 additional teachers to primary schools since the Government took office last summer.  This shows that the Government has a clear focus on the needs of primary schools.  Sound and responsible Government means acting carefully in a measured and balanced way when there is global economic uncertainty.  Difficult choices must be made, but they are in our long-term interest and will, ultimately, enable us to fulfil our promises.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I will share time with Deputies Tom Hayes and Brian Hayes.I will not mention any specific schools in my constituency because over the past ten years I have raised by way of parliamentary question the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio time and time again.  I got the same reply time after time, explaining to me that the Government was spending more money than in 1997 and that more resources were being put into the system than then.  Those replies did not deal with the issue.  I was not looking for a history lesson, but wanted someone to attend to the pertinent issue at the time.  The issue not only affected my constituency, which is next door to Dublin, but other constituencies throughout the country.It is sad that during the reign of the Celtic tiger nothing was done to improve the situation.  The saddest story the Government has to tell tomorrow's children is that during the reign of the Celtic tiger we had full and plenty in the land, but they ate, drank and were merry and went to the tent in Ballybrit and other places and had a great time.  However, they will have to tell the children they are very sorry because they did not have the time, resources or ingenuity to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.  They were unable to do so because of a combination of factors, including inadequate school buildings and the failure to recognise the problems.  The buildings were old and decrepit and were the same classrooms the parents of the children attended 25 or 30 years previously.I am not making a personal attack on the Minister and Minister of State opposite me, but it is appalling that we have come through the era of the Celtic tiger, a time when we were seen worldwide as a country of plenty and when we were boasting about the resources we had and what we could do with them, and have done nothing for our children.  The Government has prehistoric attitudes to everything.If there is one thing the Government must do, it must shake up the Department.  It must stop going round in circles and making excuses.  It must stop trying to find ways out of doing things, thereby ensuring nothing will be done.  I urge the Minister to deal with this because the Department will strangle him if he does not.I and others have raised the issue of the pupil-teacher ratio repeatedly over the past seven or eight years and the INTO and others came on board with us before the last general election.  I remember attending a meeting of 500 or 600 people in my constituency at which promises were made by the Government party to the effect that the Government would deliver incrementally over a prescribed period.  It did not deliver and has failed in that regard.  Is it not sad that the Government, having codded the people for so long, is now codding the children?

This has been a terrible year for teachers, parents and students alike with regard to all types of school funding.  We are discussing tonight a broken promise on school numbers, whereby the 40 schools discussed in this debate stand to lose a teacher due to a broken promise.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Government has failed time and again to look after young people by failing to put adequate funding in place for their education.  We have witnessed the cancellation of the summer works scheme and have seen the Government take parents to court in order to deny them education for children with special needs.  We have witnessed parents and students subsidising schools in order to pay water, heat and electricity charges.  What can the Opposition do about it?This is not good enough.  Parents, students, and teachers deserve better.  Our economic and social future depends on our children receiving a good educational foundation and improved literacy skills to ensure they get the best start in life.  The children at the Christian Brothers primary school, the Monastery school, in Tipperary town will not be getting the best start in life due to this broken promise.This school had nine classroom teachers but will only have eight next September.  Where is the promise that the Government made in 2002, when it committed to children up to nine years having class sizes of 20?  Why does the Government persist in recognising how important class size is and committing to improving it, particularly in more socially deprived areas, and then withholding this essential resource?  How can the Government ignore the disruption this causes to schools, students and teachers, disturbing established work practices and relationships and tampering with literacy skills at a crucial period of development?The required number of students at the Monastery school on 30 September 2007 was 232 but the actual number was 231.  Due to the Government's pledges at election time, there was no need for concern.  As the promise was not kept, this school now loses a teacher.This commitment was signed into the programme for Government by Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and others.  I have known the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, for a long time.  I challenge him to listen to the argument made by the Monastery school in Tipperary town.  Two weeks ago I heard the case put forward by the school's principal and the committed young teacher who will lose her job in September.  Across from the school is the headquarters of Muintir na Tíre.  I was reminded of when Canon John Hayes made the case for rural Ireland:There is a need for leadership and action from those in high office in order to safeguard the future needs of our people, our children and our communities.I put it to the Minister to take his lead from Canon John Hayes.

I thank the many parents, teachers, members of boards of management who came from all parts of the country to hear this debate in their Parliament.  I want to recognise their attendance because they came for one reason — to support their schools and their children and ensure they get the best opportunities.If the Minister decided to support our motion, it would send a positive signal not only to those 28 schools concerned but to the primary education sector that the Government will deliver on its promises.  By not supporting the motion, the Minister is saying the commitment made in the programme for Government is a thing of the past.

When the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, was leaving Marlborough Street by the back door on 6 May, she gave me the list which contained 40 schools which would lose 42 teachers.  When those schools were contacted independently, only 28 had been informed.  Either I was deliberately misinformed by the Department or another 12 schools have yet to be informed by the Department which got information about these schools on 30 September last year.  This is how incompetent the Minister and his Department are.  It is a Department not fit for purpose as Deputy Ruairí Quinn said earlier.The Minister has the brass neck to tell the House of the number of children in classes over 30 pupils but he is still fiddling around with the figures.

We speak about planning for education and giving schools autonomy but we have a dysfunctional Department with the Minister at its head.  His Department does not know what it is talking about when it gives misinformation to the House.  That is the problem at the heart of this debate.I recognise the Minister is an honest man and new to the brief and these complex issues.  Will the Minister tell the House whether the commitment given to the people in 2002 about class sizes for children up to nine years still stands?

Where is Dublin's north-side equivalent of Hugo Chavez, Deputy Finian McGrath, tonight?  Last night in the Chamber he sat on every side.  What will the last of the socialists on Dublin's north side do about the schools in his constituency?  Deputy Charlie O'Connor gave us his usual fascinating "Thank you very much Mr. Eastwood" speech on the motion but Tallaght needs Mr. Tallaght tonight.  The Green Party's alleged next Minister, Deputy Mary White, spoke about the need for a "certain humanity" in a speech given to her by the Department of Education and Science.  Where is the Government on this issue?I submit that teaching matters.  I submit we are not spending enough on primary education.  I concur with Deputy Leo Varadkar that this is about choices.  In the OECD table on education expenditure, we are at the bottom.  Ireland spends 4.6% of its GDP on education where other OECD members are way ahead.  In this country, 24% of the population is in formal education but we spend little on them.  More must be spent.  This is a promise that was to be delivered, they told us, before the election——

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the important issue of the lack of provision of the BCG vaccine in the Cork area to prevent tuberculosis.  I am aware of recent national difficulties regarding the supply of the BCG vaccine which arose due to technical difficulties in the manufacturing laboratory that provides the vaccine in Europe.  This problem has since been resolved and is not related to the issue I raise.The problem in Cork was highlighted last year when 17 cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed in the months of March, April and May.  While two of the cases involved adults, the balance involved young children in two crèches, one in Little Island and the other in Douglas.  As a result of the marked increase in the notification figures, 132 children attending the private crèche facilities in question were given antibiotics as a preventative measure.  This created considerable anxiety, worry, frustration and anger among parents who had placed their children in facilities under the regulatory control of the health authorities.At the time the children contracted tuberculosis, many people were not aware that the BCG vaccine was not being administered in the Cork region for historical reasons.  Subsequently, it was decided to administer the vaccine to newborn babies and young children in the Cork area.  This welcome change in policy meant that as of October 2007, the vaccination was made available to all newborn babies in the area and take-up was substantial.According to figures provided to a regional health forum last week, 9,654 children were waiting for a BCG vaccination as of 1 April 2008.  Those on the waiting list include many active children who are attending crèche and pre-school facilities, sitting in trolleys in supermarkets or engaging in other activities.  These children need the vaccine and their parents want them to have it but find their local health care providers are unable to offer it.  Vulnerable children deserve the support of the health services in their area to ensure they are protected against tuberculosis, particularly when they are out and about in the community.Until last year, it was not considered necessary to provide the BCG vaccination.  The health authorities have now recognised the need to provide the vaccination to newborn babies and younger children.  Despite the commitment to provide the vaccine, almost 10,000 people are on the waiting list.  How does the Department propose to deal with the waiting list?  What provisions are being put in place to administer the vaccine?  Are sufficient clinicians available to administer it?  When will the necessary infrastructure be in place to provide the vaccine?The lack of BCG vaccination facilities in Cork is extremely worrying and frustrating for parents.  Many parents have made alternative arrangements for their children, giving addresses of relatives in Waterford, Dublin or Kerry in order to have their children vaccinated in these areas.  The vaccine must be made available in the area in which people reside.  While the local health authorities have made a commitment to provide it, we have no idea when the vast waiting list will be tackled.  I ask the Minister of State to provide answers.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Clune for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the importance the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive attach to this issue.The BCG vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis, is usually given to newborn babies but can also be given to older children and adults who are considered to be at risk of developing TB.  The vaccine has contributed to the dramatic decline in tuberculosis over the past 40 years.The Department of Health and Children has been informed by the Health Service Executive that in the Cork area, BCG vaccination is currently provided on an ‘at risk' basis.  Vaccination is offered to new-born infants where there is a close family history of tuberculosis, such as a parent, immigrants from high incidence countries and their children, or children intending to visit high incident countries for more than one month, or contacts with cases of active respiratory tuberculosis.  The HSE South plans to hold BCG vaccination clinics throughout the Cork area in the near future.  A BCG vaccination programme for new-born infants was due to be introduced last October, but owing to a shortage of the vaccine from November 2007 until March 2008, a BCG vaccination waiting list now exists.  This shortage was a Europe-wide problem, as the manufacturer in question is the only company that supplies the vaccine to the European market.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine as it has a very short shelf life.Parents who request the BCG vaccination for their child have their child's name placed on a waiting list.  Plans for additional resources are at an advanced stage and the recruitment process is under way.  In the meantime, those children considered to be most at risk are being prioritized.Immunisation, a safe and effective way to help the body prevent or fight off certain diseases, is provided through vaccinations that are administered to induce immunity.  Under the childhood immunisation programme, all vaccines and their administration are provided free of charge for all children.  Parental consent is required for the administration of vaccinations to children and young people up to the age of 16.  Vaccination is not mandatory in Ireland, but is strongly advised by the Department.The objective of the primary childhood immunisation programme is to achieve an uptake level of 95%, which is the rate required to provide population immunity and to protect children and the population generally from the potentially serious diseases concerned. Ireland's recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the national immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.I take this opportunity to urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme, in order to ensure that both their children and the general population have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.

It is a disgrace that it has come to this.  Short-term contract workers will be greatly affected, especially agency staff and dieticians.  This has occurred in the same week that a diabetes and endocrinology unit was opened.  Last year the Minister opened a new medical wing in the hospital, yet the HSE is now laying off staff and claiming that this is due to cost containment measures.  No jobs have been cut at the top of the HSE, yet staff that are already over-burdened are being cut.What will be the state of Our Lady's Children's Hospital if nearly 10% of the staff are laid off?  The Minister of State needs to tell us.  Will it be downgraded?  Will it be closed or relocated?  Will it suffer death by a thousand cuts?  The staff, the patients and the public are entitled to know what the future holds, so that they can make alternative arrangements.  We cannot have continual cuts such as those occurring at the moment.  The Minister of State will tell us that there has been increased investment in this hospital for the last number of years.  That has occurred after generations of severe under-funding, but these increases do not take into account the increased workload of staff and the ongoing modernisation programme.The only reason these are agency jobs is the HSE freeze on full-time jobs.  The Minister for Health and Children should step in and ensure that these cuts are reversed and that the hospital has enough staff to carry out its work.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter for the staff at the hospital in Crumlin, as well as the parents and the sick children who will be most affected by these cuts.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital is widely recognised as a quality hospital for paediatrics.  People across the country avail of the services and the very high quality facilities there.The hospital has been forced to employ agency staff because of the recruitment freeze by the HSE, and now it is being forced to let them go.  Cutting front-line services is not the way to deliver a quality health service and to ensure the best outcome for patients.  That must be the bottom line.  Cutting front-line staff numbers in the HSE will only lead to further pressures on the remaining staff.  Ultimately, it will mean longer waiting times for the children who urgently need treatment.  It is inevitable that the service to sick children will be affected if 100 staff are removed.  There is no question about that.Parents with sick children cannot afford to wait for treatment and they do not want to be told that there is a two-year waiting list for essential treatment for their small child.  They do not want to know about service planning and they do not want to know about meeting efficiencies.  They simply want their sick children treated as quickly and efficiently as possible.I urge the Minister for Health and Children to review the HSE structure to allow for cuts to be made in areas that do not affect patients.  The logic of spending €19 million on a report on the hospital service in the north east does not stack up when compared to cuts of 100 temporary and agency staff in the leading children's hospital in the State.  There is a question of priorities when deciding where to impose cuts.  The Minister of State and the Minister should find a way to ensure that front-line staff are not sacrificed for what is effectively a book-keeping exercise.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	556	Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin provides acute, secondary and tertiary hospital services for children.  The hospital receives a significant proportion of its funding from the Exchequer via the Health Service Executive.  In 2008, the hospital has an allocation of €137 million, up from €128 million in 2007.  The hospital's budget has risen by over €38 million since 2004,  which represents a 38% increase.Each hospital funded by the HSE is required to deliver services within the financial allocation provided.  The HSE is fully aware of the financial challenges faced by the hospital.  It is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2008 financial allocation and service plan.  The hospital has an overrun of €10 million from last year and a projected overrun of €14 million for this year.  As part of the discussions on the budgetary position, the HSE has made an agreement with the hospital, on a once off basis, to provide a further €7 million this year.  The hospital must now work within its budget, which will be amended from €137 million to €144 million for 2008.  The priority of the HSE and the hospital management is to ensure that services for children at the hospital are maintained at an optimum level.There has been an increase in activity at the hospital in 2008.  The hospital is ahead of its service plan targets.  The number of day cases is up by 12.3%, outpatient activity is up by 7.7% and the number of inpatients treated has increased by 1.6%.  The number of staff employed at the hospital has increased by 433 whole-time equivalents since 2004.  At the end of March the number of whole-time equivalents employed at the hospital was 282, or 20% above the approved employment ceiling.The initial focus of the discussions between hospital management and the HSE is on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined.  Pay costs represent over 70% of the hospital's expenditure.  The hospital has indicated that there will be a need to reduce the number of temporary and agency staff numbers, but it is not in a position at this stage to confirm the number of posts involved.Significant investment has been put into developing services at the hospital in the last number of years in areas such as cardiac, haematology, oncology and MRI services.  Discussions are also at an advanced stage to create additional intensive care facilities at the hospital.  The development of the national paediatric hospital is a priority project for the Government.  Our objective is to provide a world class specialist paediatric service for children.  The McKinsey report to the HSE recommended that the population level and projected demand can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital which should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Each of the three existing paediatric hospitals, including Our Lady's Children's Hospital, expressed strong support for the development of a single national paediatric hospital.  In October the HSE announced the details of the high level framework brief for the new hospital which will be built on a site at the Mater Hospital.  The brief was prepared by RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company.The brief includes a detailed assessment of the capacity of the selected site at the Mater Hospital.  The analysis indicated that all the requirements can be accommodated on the site and still allow expansion capacity beyond the year 2021.  The total projected bed requirement for the hospital to 2021 ranges between 352 and 454 beds.  The estimated space requirements have been calculated on the upper figure.  The brief sets out the recommended model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital through an ambulatory urgent care service.  The first of these centres will be developed at Tallaght.  The services to be provided will include urgent care consultations, outpatient appointments and day surgery.The national hospital development board was established last year to develop the new hospital.  The board is in the process of procuring professional project management support services.  Following this, the next stage of the project will involve the preparation of a detailed development brief for the new hospital.  The target of the board is to have the development brief completed by the end of the first quarter of 2009.  The Minister looks forward to continuing progress on this important development.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the closure of the Mercy University Hospital, Cork.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Health and Children four weeks ago.  She replied that it was a matter for the HSE.  The HSE eventually sent a response but I decided to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  Although it is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, whom I wish well, it is frustrating that the Minister who is directly responsible and who, in conjunction with the HSE, made the decision to close an essential ward of the Mercy University Hospital does not come into the House to answer important questions on the health and well-being of people in my constituency and the adjoining constituency of Deputy Clune, who is present.The Mercy University Hospital took up the slack when the North Infirmary Hospital in Cork was closed in the late 1980s.  This was a tragedy for the north side of Cork city but the Mercy University Hospital, located in the middle parish, took up the slack.  Through the commitment of medical, nursing and non-medical staff, it delivered a service to the people of the area and never turned any paying or non-paying patients away from its doors.To say that I received an answer is to be charitable to the author of the response.  It was confirmed that the 31-bed St. Catherine's ward closed on 3 May 2008 and will remain closed until at least the end of 2008.  This has resulted in the closure of 19 surgical and 12 medical beds.  That will have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of people in my constituency and in the adjoining constituency that Deputy Clune represents.  I take issue with the contents of the response.  It is an insult to state that the plans were formulated with a view to maintaining all existing and essential services and minimising the impact on patient care.  That is pure codswallop.  The hospital is now being humiliated by the Minister, the HSE and the local senior management.  This was done without informing public representatives, who cannot get information.  The humiliation of the hospital was done in the interests of balancing the books.Fianna Fáil made a big issue many years ago of health cuts affecting the elderly and the sick.  That is what will happen in this case.  To say that all existing and essential services will be maintained is untrue.  In tandem with the closure of this ward, an accident and emergency unit that cost €5 million to build has been idle since January 2007.  It will open on 1 June but will offer a service only during office hours.  It is an emergency service but people do not meet accidents or have mishaps only during office hours.  The claim in writing that all existing and essential services will be maintained is untrue.  I will not say anything stronger than that because I would be reprimanded.Having fulfilled its role through the years, the hospital is being humiliated.  The response also stated that the local management board of the hospital took the decision to close the 31-bed unit.  In theory, the board may have taken the decision but the gun was put to its head by the faceless people and some who are well known in the HSE.  The choice was to close or face the consequences.  To say that this was a decision made by local management is the washing of hands of responsibility for this closure, which will have a serious impact on people's well-being.The HSE is running a dysfunctional system.  It is out of control and has lost its direction.  While people are suffering and administrators and medical staff are losing their jobs, Professor Drumm and his senior cohorts are taking their bonuses.  If leadership is to come from the top, senior administrators and those who have failed to deliver should not take bonuses.  This is a matter I will address tomorrow at the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a scandal that these people continue to take performance bonuses when services are not being delivered.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I am taking the matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  The Government is committed to the provision of a high level of quality health services throughout the country, including in the Cork region.  The HSE is obliged to provide services in line with available funding.  In turn, all its managers and agencies have a clear responsibility to operate within their designated budgets and achieve the service levels for 2008 as set out in the HSE's national service plan.  These include service level targets for the acute hospital services nationally of over 2.7 million outpatient attendances, almost 600,000 in-patient discharges and over 580,000 day cases.  HSE management at national, regional and local level reviews expenditure and activity levels on a weekly basis in order to ensure that hospitals are adhering to the service levels of activity for which they have been funded.The HSE has advised that to ensure that they remain within their approved expenditure levels, all hospitals within the southern hospitals group have put together a budget break-even plan for 2008.  These plans are based on a realistic assessment of achievable objectives for the hospitals within the group.  The plans were formulated with a view to maintaining all existing essential and emergency services while minimising the overall impact on patient care.  Hospitals within the southern hospitals group have identified a number of value for money and income generating initiatives that will realise some savings in 2008.  These measures include a reduction in the use of agency cover, locum cover and overtime.  Several areas of non-pay expenditure have also been targeted for reduction, most particularly staff travel and non-essential training.Over the past three years, the HSE allocated significant funding to the Mercy University Hospital to enable it to cope with service pressures.  In 2006, the budget allocation was €67.7 million, in 2007 it was €72.2 million, while this year €73.6 million was allocated to it.  An analysis of the Mercy University Hospital expenditure by the HSE in the early months of this year indicated that the hospital would significantly exceed its budget allocation unless corrective action was taken.  With this in mind, management at the Mercy University Hospital was required to readjust the hospital's expenditure levels.  Accordingly, the hospital introduced a number of value for money and efficiency initiatives along the lines already mentioned.  It has also promoted initiatives which support the concept of working better and smarter, such as pre-operative assessment clinics, same-day admission process and reducing the length of stay.  However, as these steps would not in themselves have been sufficient to bring projected expenditure back in line with permitted levels, management at the hospital decided to close a 31-bed ward.  St. Catherine's ward was closed on 3 May 2008 and will, I understand, remain closed for the remainder of 2008.Management at Mercy University Hospital and the HSE continue to monitor carefully the impact of these initiatives on the hospital's overall budgetary position.  The Minister has been assured by the HSE that every effort will be made to ensure the measures outlined will have a minimal effect on patient services.  The HSE has indicated essential, elective and emergency services will not be affected and that planned hospital service activity levels at the Mercy University Hospital for 2008 will be met.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the eligibility criteria for community employment schemes.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion.I recognise the major advances in community employment schemes since they were first introduced.  They have a tremendous impact on communities in which they are operational and relevant.  They provide a good source of labour for urban and rural community groups and are important in terms of assisting individuals to develop and hone their skills and return to work.  The schemes are now recognised as a job-seekers' initiative and have removed the stigma associated with what was previously known as "the dole".The advent of the rural social scheme has been effective.  It is now part of our overall policy framework in terms of getting people back to work and recognising the importance of this work to communities.  Both schemes work exceptionally well.  The rural social scheme is good in that it does not include a definitive timeframe for participation.  This comes into play only when others are seeking to come on to the scheme, which is not the case in many rural areas.  The rural social scheme also requires that a participant have a herd number.A difficulty has arisen in respect of community employment schemes.  These schemes which provide meaningful employment and training have been useful and helpful in terms of developing skills for the construction sector, which has been going through a boom and required additional staff.  Community employment schemes provided valuable training in block laying, stonework and carpentry.  They have been hugely beneficial in rural areas in terms of landscaping, graveyard maintenance and the upkeep of community areas.  In urban areas, the community employment schemes are useful in providing support to the disability sector.  They are a great resource for many of the social inclusion groups working to develop and resolve some of the issues in this area.  They have also been useful in providing much needed staff to assist the development of communities in built-up areas.  These schemes benefit not only communities but the participants.A difficulty arises in respect of people aged 55 years.  Amendments have been made to the scheme to allow a person aged over 55 years to participate in a scheme for an additional three years or, for a person in receipt of a disability payment, an additional four years.  A person who at age 55 years commences employment on a community employment scheme for the first time is permitted under existing criteria to participate in that scheme for six years.  However, in the current economic environment of a contracting labour market, these people on reaching 61 years of age will encounter difficulties in obtaining suitable or gainful employment in their local area.  There may be employment available in other parts of the country but people who have settled in rural areas will not travel or uproot their families and move to a larger town or city where work might be available.I hope the Minister will re-examine the criteria to allow people aged 60 or 61 years to participate in a community employment scheme until they reach retirement age.  I am aware of a number of cases involving people who have only one year remaining before they reach retirement age and who because of the six year cap must return to the job-seeker's allowance.  This is soul destroying for people who are providing a good service to the community and who want to make a contribution for the payment they receive.  I do not believe the cost of such cases will be overly burdensome on the State.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this issue, perhaps as part of an overall review of the scheme, for the benefit of individuals and communities.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan.The FÁS community employment programme is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  Community employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assisting them to enhance their technical and personal skills.The community employment programme was restructured in 1999 to limit participation by new participants to three years with effect from April 2000.  This change was introduced to encourage unemployed persons to progress to training or education and employment options where possible.  However, the three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period.  In general, approximately 20% of participants, including persons under 55 years of age, have benefited from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.  In November 2004, to cater for older workers the three-year community employment cap was revised to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a six-year period on community employment, based on participation since 3 April 2000.  This was introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.In July 2006, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  One of the key objectives of this plan is to increase participation rates in community employment by people with disabilities.  To provide additional training to assist progression to employment for people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from three to four years and, for people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from six to seven years.  The upper age limit for community employment participants is 65 years.FÁS is continuing to develop the content of the community employment programme.  The new approach involves the introduction of an individual learner planning process which focuses on meeting the learning needs of participants.  The individual learner plan provides for the planning, organising and recording of work experience, training and development received by each participant while working on community employment.  It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures.  Under this individualised approach, FÁS has proposed four new FETAC awards relevant to community employment and job initiative learners, including a certificate in personal and social employment skills, level 3; a certificate in vocational employment skills, level 3; a certificate of applied employment skills, level 4; and a certificate in specific employment skills, level 5.  These new awards will facilitate all the planned learning completed on community employment or JI by each participant being rolled up into the achievement of a FETAC award.  This will provide added value to the learner and will support their progression to further training or employment.Funding for community employment in 2008 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes.  There are currently more than 22,000 people participating on community employment schemes nationally.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibly in the management of this allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  The provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor and community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  It should be remembered that participants remaining on community employment preclude others from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  It also operates the programme in as flexible a manner as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.The Government will continue to support the positive role of community employment in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  We are keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	561	I want to make it clear at the outset that intensive surveillance operations by the Gardaí, covert and otherwise, are and will continue to be, a most effective tool in the fight against serious crime, including, in particular, gangland crime.It is clearly evident that Garda surveillance is one of the tools of crime prevention and detection.  Information obtained through surveillance allows the Gardaí to disrupt planned activities or obtain evidence which can help to secure convictions in criminal trials.However, we have to recognise that those involved in criminality are constantly altering their modus operandi with the aim of frustrating Garda actions to counter their activities.  Everyone here would agree that the Gardaí must be properly equipped, in legislative terms, to enable them to act against all forms of criminality.  It is in this context that the question of improving Garda surveillance capacity and techniques must be viewed.Accordingly, my Department, in close consultation with the Garda Commissioner, has begun drafting the heads of a Bill in this area.  The principal aims of this Bill will be to provide a clear statutory basis for certain forms of Garda surveillance and to deal, as appropriate, with issues arising in relation to the use of the results of such surveillance as evidence.The Deputy and the House will appreciate that the issue of the use of such evidence in criminal proceedings is not straightforward.  On the one hand the use of such evidence may in some cases help secure convictions.  On the other hand it is vital to avoid as much as possible a situation arising where Garda techniques for intelligence gathering may, as a result, be compromised.  These opposing outcomes must be properly balanced if any scheme is to improve the position of the Gardaí in tackling criminality in all its forms.

It was also considered prudent, given the particular nature of the subject, to consult with the Chief Justice.Following contacts with the Chief Justice a working group has now been established to advance the Bill.  The Group comprises a nominee each of my Department and of the Chief Justice. I am confident that this approach will ensure that the details of the proposed Bill can be finalised in the reasonably near future.

The Garda Commissioner has given a commitment to appoint an additional 21 personnel by 2010.The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Programme and aim to divert young people away from crime and anti social behaviour.  These Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.   There are currently 100 of these type of projects operating throughout the country and this number will be extended to 168 in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.

One of these reports will deal with allegations that two senior members of An Garda Síochána acted with impropriety.  The other will deal with allegations of ongoing harassment of the McBreartys and their extended family and how their complaints to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board were dealt with.The Chairman has previously indicated to my predecessor in writing that he hopes to submit his two remaining reports to the Minister by mid June 2008.  Under the terms of the resolution passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 March 2002, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged, save in exceptional circumstances relating to potential criminal prosecutions, to lay any report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 14 days of its receipt.

However a working group, established by the Commissioner, is examining the commemoration of members of An Garda Síochána who died in active service.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that he is considering a proposal to construct a memorial garden in the grounds of Dublin Castle and I look forward to seeing the detailed plans for it. Of course, the cenotaph in the Garda Depot also commemorates the members of the force who have given their lives in the service of the country.

I expect to bring proposals on this to Cabinet shortly.In recent days, at a meeting between the Ombudsman Commission and my Department at a senior level, the Commission discussed the benefits of some legislative change in their area and the level of staffing necessary to enable them to efficiently manage their workload.I will of course carefully consider any specific proposals the Ombudsman Commission may make, taking into account the developing experience of their workload and the new efficiencies expected to result from legislative change.  My officials will stay in dialogue with the Ombudsman Commission on how best to continue to fulfil their functions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	567	When a case of speeding is detected, the registered owner of the vehicle involved receives a fixed charge notice.  This notice informs the owner that he or she may during the period of 28 days pay a specified fixed charge and that in the following period of 28 days they may pay the specified fixed charge, increased by 50%.  In either case the driver receives a certain number of penalty points.  If the registered owner was not the driver of the vehicle at the time the speeding offence was committed, he or she must nominate the actual driver.  If the driver, either the registered owner or the nominated driver, does not pay the fixed charge, he or she will be prosecuted for the offence.If a prosecution takes place in a speeding case, when it comes to court it can be struck out for a number of reasons.  One reason is that the original fixed charge notice was not received.  Other reasons are that the person alleged to be the registered owner of the vehicle is not in fact the owner or it is at the request of the prosecuting Garda.  A case cannot be struck out by a court unless a summons has been received.The District Court rules provide a number of methods for service of summonses.  These include service by registered post, personal service on the defendant and service at the defendant's home or place of business.  With a view to ensuring the standard of service is as high as possible, I am informed that An Garda Síochána is currently reviewing the practices and procedures operating within An Garda Síochána for the service of summonses.I am informed that, in line with the Interpretation Act 2005, An Garda Síochána currently uses ordinary post to serve fixed charge notices.  In addition, the Road Traffic Acts 2002 and 2004 provide that, in a prosecution for an offence for which a fixed charge notice issued, it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the relevant notice has been served or caused to be served.The giving of false evidence by a driver in court, for example asserting that he or she had not received a fixed charge notice when it fact he or she had, is a serious offence, punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both.My colleague the Minister for Transport, who has responsible for road traffic legislation, intends to progress a new Road Traffic Bill in the latter half of this year.  His Department is undertaking consultations with other Departments and agencies involved in the enforcement of road traffic law on matters for possible inclusion in the Bill, including steps which could lead to improvements in the service of fixed charge notices.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	568	I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there has been an increase in the number of handguns licensed in this jurisdiction since 2004 following a legal challenge taken on the temporary custody order made in 1972 by the then Minister for Justice. The following table shows the number of such firearms licensed each year since 2004.YearTotal (cumulative number)2007/08*1,7872006/071,3672005/069462004/05305*2007/08 figures are operational, provisional and liable to change.It should be noted that the total number of hand guns licensed is less than one per cent of all licensed firearms in the State.  The House may be interested to know that in this State, in the region of 200,000 people own approx. 231,000 firearms.  I should also add, to put the matter in context, that our definition of what is a firearm is among the most stringent to be found in any jurisdiction.  Under the Firearms Act 1925, any device with a muzzle energy greater that one joule is regarded as a firearm.  Many countries, for example, do not require a licence for a wide range of sporting firearms which are all treated as part of the firearms regime here.Obviously, the key concern of my Department is public safety.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006, when fully brought into force, will modernise and tighten up the law in relation to firearms certificates.  Section 32 provides that a number of conditions must be met before a firearms certificate can be granted, which include the applicant having a good reason for requiring the firearm in respect of which a certificate is applied for and that the person can be permitted to possess the firearm without danger to public safety or security.  A further condition is that the person has provided secure accommodation for the firearm and ammunition.  Under the section the applicant has to provide the names and addresses of two referees who may be contacted to attest to the applicant's character.  An applicant must also provide written consent for any enquiries in relation to the applicant's medical history that may be made from a health professional.  The section also provides for the making of regulations providing for secure accommodation for firearms and these will be made at the earliest possible date.I intend to bring the remaining parts of the Act 2006 into force as quickly as possible and I will bring forward some technical amendments to enable their commencement, in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will be published in the coming weeks.I am also conscious that some recent court judgements may have a bearing in this matter and will have them examined in this context.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  The CSO has published crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

There are three main forms of direct therapeutic intervention for sex offenders currently operating within the Irish prison system.  These are as follows:An intensive sex offender programme which has been in operation since 1994 and is delivered currently in Arbour Hill Prison,Individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Service, andOne to one interventions by visiting psychiatrists who provide support to prisoners.The intensive programme is a group programme managed and delivered by the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service in partnership with the Probation Service.  It caters for eight offenders at a time, taking eleven months to complete.  The programme is voluntary.  Although delivered in Arbour Hill Prison, it is available to sex offenders in other prisons.  The practice has been to invite all eligible sex offenders to apply for a place on the programme when a new group programme is being set up.The programme is a structured, offence focused programme, employing a cognitive behavioural approach with a relapse prevention component.  The programme places considerable emphasis on the therapeutic process within the group and on supporting each participant in gaining the knowledge, skills, attitudes and self confidence necessary to live life differently and more constructively in the future.  The programme seeks to address the behaviour that leads to offending.In general the criteria for suitability for participation in the Sex Offender Programme are:Participants are convicted and sentenced;Participants accept responsibility for their offending;Participants are physically and emotionally capable of working on offending and personal issues in a group setting (age / physical health / mental & emotional health);Participants have basic literacy skills;Participants have a level of learning ability to understand the processes of the programme;Preferably, participants are within 24 months of release;Preferably participants have engaged in individual work on their offending with either the Psychology or Probation Services prior to participating in the Sex Offender Programme.A total of 128 sex offenders have completed the sex offender programme to date.  A further eight men are currently undertaking the programme.  There is no waiting list in operation in respect of participation on the programme.Some individuals engage with the therapeutic services initially to seek assistance in adjusting to imprisonment or to address their mental health needs.  Following such interventions, offenders are often more open to looking at their sexual offending and a concentrated period of motivational work is conducted to help them address their offending behaviour and related issues.  In response to such counselling, many offenders who initially might deny responsibility for their crime or deny any need for treatment, are motivated towards some process of change.  For some offenders this results in them undertaking the more intensive sex offender programme, for others it results in sustained individual therapy around their offending or engagement in some other programme available in the prison system.Probation Officers working in a prison context provide individual counselling to sex offenders as part of their generic role in relation to offence focused work and as part of the Parole Board Process.  This counselling can vary from one session addressing a particular problem to intensive ongoing counselling.A number of offenders undergo one-to-one counselling in relation to their sexual offending with the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service.  The Probation Service also engages with prisoners on a one-to-one basis.The Sex Offender Programme is currently under review and the recommendations from this will be incorporated in the new Sex Offender Management Policy currently being drafted.  The purpose of the policy statement is to outline the steps that the Irish Prison Service will take to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the risk of offenders re-offending after their release.  Options under consideration include more flexible delivery of programmes based on individual offender's risks, needs and capacity.  The likely outcome is a package of sex offender interventions comprising group and individual programmes for a significantly larger group of offenders.Two community based intervention programmes are currently operated by the Probation Service in conjunction with the Granada Institute under the name of Lighthouse.  These group based programmes operate in Dublin and target those who have been convicted of sexual offences against children.  Each programme operates over an eleven month period. These programmes are also currently being reviewed.

As the House will appreciate the merits of Electronic Monitoring require careful consideration not least from a cost effectiveness perspective developments in technology, most suitable offender group(s) and the likely impact on crime prevention.In this regard my Department is keeping developments in other jurisdictions under constant review.   Experience abroad indicates that there are technical, operational and cost limitations.  There has been instances where people have committed serious crimes while subject to electronic monitoring and I would have reservations about its application in bail cases.I would emphasise that Electronic Monitoring is just one response among a range of community based sanctions in managing offenders. It is therefore necessary to look at the merits of the full range of options available before coming to any final judgment on Electronic Monitoring.

To date we have two such projects funded by my Department, through the Probation Service.   We must, of course, learn from the experience of how restorative justice has worked both here in Ireland and in other jurisdictions so that future expansion of the restorative justice model will be guided by best practice.It was on that basis, that my Department established a National Commission on Restorative Justice in March, 2007. In welcoming the Commission's Interim Report on Restorative Justice, published on 21 May, I indicated that we must optimise all our polices and resources in the unrelenting fight against crime, so that the citizen is protected, the offender is helped to rehabilitate and the best mix of policies is implemented.The Interim Report looks at how restorative justice is currently applied here and in other jurisdictions and examines research-based evidence abroad on the potential of restorative justice as an additional measure to combat crime and respond to the needs of  victims.  The Commission will now continue with its in-depth examination of the issue and  I expect to receive its final report and recommendations by June 2009. The Final Report will inform future decisions on making greater use of the concept of Restorative Justice here.

The report is now at final draft stage and it is anticipated that it will be completed shortly.Engagement with the community is a key priority of An Garda Síochána. Community policing is constantly being reviewed and developed and the enhanced liaison structures between Garda management and local authorities through Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing Fora will continue to be of significant benefit to the policing of both urban and rural areas.Important partnerships in which the Gardaí are involved are the Community Alert Programme and Neighbourhood Watch.  National strategies for Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch for the period 2007-2011 were launched in Autumn 2007.  The new strategies include a number of significant improvements.  Training has been provided to the sergeants and inspectors most closely involved with the Programmes.  In addition, the holding of information seminars is continuing for all liaison Gardaí and scheme coordinators for Garda Districts and Divisions.Crime Prevention Officers are available to offer crime prevention and security advice to residential and business groups and regularly provide such advice through local media outlets, newspaper and radio broadcasts. In addition, residents in rural areas are encouraged to establish and rejuvenate Community Alert Schemes assisted by members of local Community Policing Units.

In this regard, the Commission has over the past three years disbursed €2.5 m to over 40 organisations who support victims of crime.  The Commission recently submitted to me its Framework Document — Recommendations for the Future Structure and Services for Victims of Crime.  In the course of preparing their Report the Commission was in contact with the major stakeholders with a view to embodying these opinions in the Framework Document. This Document is now being considered within my Department with a view to developing the best possible structures for the support of victims of crime into the future and thus honouring the commitment given in the Programme for Government.The Third Annual Report of the Commission as in their previous Annual Reports sets out the work the Commission undertook during 2007. It outlines its role as ensuring the provision of a high quality service across the country to victims of crime. It notes the importance of a coherent strategy of victim support  and that this can only be achieved through co-operation and co-ordination between all the criminal justice agencies.Since their appointment, the Commission have performed a valuable public service function for which I am grateful.

The original objectives of the investigation team under this dedicated initiative were to trace, review and collate all evidence pertaining to the separate Garda investigations into the disappearance of six women in the Leinster area. Subsequently the investigations into the disappearance of four other missing women were also reviewed.The Investigation Team was originally and principally tasked with establishing if any commonality existed between the various disappearances. To date no such linkage or commonality has been established between the cases.Information and intelligence relative to the Operation continues to be collated and assimilated on a dedicated stand-alone database maintained for the purpose of this Operation. A Detective Superintendent retains operational responsibility for ensuring that all such information and queries received are identified, catalogued and actioned to a conclusion. The Detective Superintendent also ensures that liaison is maintained with the families of these missing women, ensuring that they are kept apprised of any progress or developments arising from further information received or lines of enquiry being pursued.Operation Trace will continue its role of collating, reviewing and examining all evidence based on enquiries and investigations conducted under the direction of the respective District Officers.I am confident that An Garda Síochána has devoted significant resources, time and investigative skills to investigate these disappearances. The cases have been subject to numerous reviews to ensure that the Gardaí maximise any new investigative opportunities and that they employ the most up to date techniques and methods in line with the best international practice.The Missing Persons Bureau in Garda Headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.  District Officers in the area where persons have gone missing take direct responsibility for all investigations and  searches carried out. Local investigation teams are appointed by the District Officer and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigation. The services of Europol and Interpol are also availed of during such investigations.Appropriate training is provided to Garda personnel to facilitate them in effectively carrying out their functions in relation to missing persons. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training. Further training initiatives have been undertaken over the years. A Search Planning and Management Course conducted by the PSNI was attended by representatives of An Garda Síochána in 2005. In addition a delegation from An Garda Síochána visited the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington, the FBI Academy, the New York Missing Persons Bureau and the New York City Coroners Department with a view to examining techniques used in the US. The experience gained by An Garda Síochána in these areas has been invaluable in their work in dealing with missing persons.In 2005 the ViCLAS (Violent Linkage System) was installed in the Criminal Intelligence Section of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. This installation, by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, provides a database to capture, collate and compare violent crimes within and across several jurisdictions. ViCLAS is a valuable tool in the investigation of serious and complex cases and encourages and facilitates communication between investigation teams in pursuit of a common goal that might not otherwise occur.In September 2004 the missing children's website www.missingkids.ie was inaugurated. It is a joint initiative between An Garda Síochána and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  This website enables the Garda Síochána to circulate instantaneously and internationally to other police forces written details and high quality photographs of children reported missing.The Garda Serious Crime Review Team was established as part of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations in 2007. The purpose of the Unit, which is managed by a Detective Superintendent, is primarily to assist Senior Investigating Officers in the investigation of serious crime, by identifying new and potential investigative opportunities and operational practices, based on lessons learned and identification of good practice for dissemination to the investigative and operational units. To date the main types of incident subject of such review have been murders recorded, primarily since 1980, for which no person has been made amenable.The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including technological resources, are in place and being used to deal with missing persons cases and are in line with best international practices. The Garda authorities continue to monitor international developments in this area with a view to introducing any further initiatives which they consider useful.

The Department will however be participating on an inter-Departmental working group chaired by the Department of Finance which will develop guidelines in relation to protecting the confidentiality of personal data within Departments.I am satisfied that my Department has sufficient perimeter and internal access controls in place to ensure reasonable protection of any personal information it holds relating to members of the public.  Insofar as data devices are concerned, the Department's IT system is designed to allow staff who need access to official information off-site to access the Department's information via a secure portal.  This means that they are working on the Department's IT network and no Departmental data rests on the device they are using to access the portal.  The capability to download information on to devices such as USB keys is heavily restricted and there have been no reports of such data being lost or compromised.The general position with respect to data protection law is set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  The Acts require that adequate security measures be taken by data controllers against unauthorised access to, destruction or loss of personal data.  The Data Protection Commissioner has a number of enforcement instruments available to him under the Act to assist him in his functions and to ensure compliance.

The 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner's proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with the functional boundaries of local authorities.The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.  The revision of the Divisional Boundaries is taking place in conjunction with a realignment of the Garda Regions leading to a more streamlined operation.  For example, the Eastern Region will now encircle the Dublin Metropolitan Region and all border counties will become part of the Northern Region and will fall within the remit of Assistant Commissioner, Northern Region.  This will more easily facilitate dialogue with the Police Service of Northern Ireland on matters of a policing nature.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that project boards have been established in each division to develop implementation plans to create and rollout the new divisions. The relevant Project Boards are managing all tasks associated with each individual rollout.The Commissioner has also indicated in the Policing Plan that an examination of Divisions and Districts within the Dublin Metropolitan Region will be conducted in 2008 for the purposes of alignment with the local authority areas and in light of demographic and infrastructural changes in the region
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 154 and 156 together.I believe that the establishment of the Garda Reserve, with the support of the vast majority of the members of this House, is one of the most important innovations in policing in Ireland in recent years.  It has strengthened the links with local communities and is a source of local support and knowledge.  It brings new life to the organisation through its members.   They bring a fresh and innovative approach to policing as they approach their duties with the different perspectives and skills developed in their everyday jobs and lives. The establishment of the Reserve allows committed individuals from a great diversity of professional, social, cultural and ethnic groups to take part in policing.The Garda Reserve is far from a failed and costly exercise.  The expenditure directly incurred in the recruitment and training of the Garda Reserve has been modest.  The benefits accrued to date far outweigh this expenditure.  At this point the Garda Reserve has members in all Garda divisions in the country.  Reserve members are being well received by full-time members and making a significant contribution to policing in their communities.I would hope that the Garda Representative Association and the association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors will focus on helping to make the Reserve work.  This is in the interests of their members who voted to accept the initiative and the country as a whole.There are currently 261 attested Reserve Gardaí and 46 Reserve trainees.  The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force. Recruitment is continuing and regular promotional efforts to attract potential Reserve members are being undertaken. Garda Reserve members undertake their training and other duties on a voluntary basis during their free time. As a result it is not possible to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  In the Annual Policing Plan for 2008 the Garda Commissioner has set a target of recruiting 270 members this year.  The next class of Reserve trainees will commence training on the 7th of June.I cannot predict exactly when the full complement of Garda Reserve members will be reached but I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is making every effort to reach it.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	583	As previously indicated to the Deputy in my answer to PQ No. 8 of 17th April 2008, engagement with the rural community and rural policing are key priorities of An Garda Síochána. Rural Policing is continually being reviewed and developed and the enhanced liaison structures between Garda Management and Local Authorities through Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing Fora will be of significant benefit to the policing of rural areas.Detective Inspectors are now appointed in each Division with specific responsibility for the investigation of serious crime in rural areas. The quality of criminal intelligence is continually improving and in early 2007, for example, such intelligence resulted in the identification of a Cork-based gang targeting the elderly in rural areas of Cork and Limerick.  A  number of persons are currently before the Courts arising from this.In order to enhance rural policing a number of initiatives have been implemented in Garda Divisions nationally. Checkpoints are held at strategic locations in rural areas to detect criminals travelling to commit crime outside the areas they reside in and to prevent the commission of crimes and offences.Crime Prevention Officers are available to offer crime prevention and security advice to residential and business groups and regularly provide such advice through local media outlets, newspaper and radio broadcasts. In addition, residents in rural areas are encouraged to establish and rejuvenate Community Alert Schemes assisted by members of local Community Policing Units.Staffing levels at Garda stations are monitored by local Garda management to ensure that adequate coverage is provided and where vacancies arise within the rural community they are filled as expeditiously as possible to ensure continuity in the service being provided by An Garda Síochána to the local community.Initiatives under Operation ‘Anvil' have been implemented in every Garda District in the country incorporating special crime prevention and detection patrols in rural areas which have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to crime. Patrol times are varied in order to maximise coverage in such areas.It is of course the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to decide on the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the Force.  Against this background, he is currently reviewing arrangements within the Garda Síochána for urban and rural community policing.   I very much welcome this, and I look forward to its outcome and to receiving the Commissioner's proposals for the future development of community policing in Ireland.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Dean Lyons case offered a thorough independent analysis of the facts surrounding the false confession made by Dean Lyons based on the evidence of all relevant witnesses. It concluded that there was no deliberate attempt to undermine the rights of Dean Lyons. At page 12 of his Report Mr Birmingham (now Judge Birmingham) makes it clear that the Commission had no role in making recommendations on future safeguards and procedures. Instead an Expert Group was established by the then Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform for that purpose.The Group will be reporting on the adequacy of Garda training, protocols, regulations and procedures, in assessing the fitness of persons to be interviewed and on the recording of any bona fide reservations of an individual member of a Garda investigation team as to the truthfulness or accuracy of self — incriminating statements.   As has been indicated in this House previously  the Group took time to allow it to comprehend the work associated with the most recently published Sixth report of the Morris Tribunal which, as Deputies will be aware, dealt extensively with the question of detention of vulnerable suspects. The Group is now considering that Report with a view to finalising their work.  As the Deputies will be aware, these matters have already been decided by the Government and the position in that respect is as indicated in response to PQ No. 2 of 17 April 2008.In the short period since taking up office I have not had the opportunity to consider in great detail how to best advance progress with these complex issues.  I do intend to move quickly on these matters and I am also conscious of the need to ensure that the widest possible range of views is canvassed and brought to bear on settling public policy in this area.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 122 together.I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that they remain committed to targeting violent crime and to tackling those who engage or facilitate persons involved in such activity.The Garda Commissioner's Policing Plan for 2008 sets out strategic goals for the Force and includes a commitment to significantly reduce the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in the trafficking of illegal drugs, guns and immigrants into and within the State.  Witness intimidation and the laundering of money are integral parts of the activities of these criminal activities and will be targeted as part of the overall strategy against these groups.Where information comes into the possession of An Garda Síochána indicating the involvement of criminals in the type of activity suggested by the Deputy, it is subject to thorough investigation and an investigation file will be submitted to the Law Officers where appropriate. Where there is justification and a legal basis, those suspected of involvement in criminal activity are arrested, detained and questioned in relation to specific crime.An Garda Síochána utilises intelligence-led operations to target organised crime gangs. All available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units to target particular gangs.A large proportion of organised criminal activity in Ireland is associated with the illicit trade in drugs.  Organised Crime is targeted on a number of fronts, involving uniform and plain-clothes Gardaí overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of criminal activities. Specialist units from National Support Services also assist in these operations and deal with the different aspects of this type of criminal activity.  A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently, with firearms being recovered and drugs seized resulting in a number of people being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.An Garda Síochána liaises on an ongoing basis with international law enforcement agencies and the Irish Prison Service to counteract the activities of persons who attempt to continue their criminal endeavours from outside the jurisdiction, or while serving prison sentences.In January of this year the Garda Commissioner announced the establishment of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent basis.  This Unit  was created on a temporary basis in November 2005 to pro-actively target organised criminal gangs. Since then the Organised Crime Unit has pro-actively targeted criminal gangs engaged in diverse types of criminality.  The main forms of criminality being committed by these gangs include activities such as armed robberies, the hi-jacking of valuable loads and commodities, ‘tiger' kidnappings, bank robberies involving firearms and the importation of large quantities of controlled drugs.Through focused, intelligence-led operations success has been achieved and the activities of many of the organised crime groups have been disrupted and a number of persons suspected of involvement in this type of criminality have been apprehended on serious charges.  Many are now before the Courts and face lengthy sentences upon conviction.Gardaí have a wide range of legislative options available to them in the investigation of crime.  For example, Section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 provides that a person who knowingly participates in, or contributes to, any activity of a criminal organisation for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the criminal organisation to commit a serious offence, whether in or outside the State, is guilty of an offence.Section 16 of this Act provides the circumstances in which certain statements can be admitted in criminal proceedings. A person refusing to give evidence by virtue of the fact that they have been intimidated may have their statement admitted in evidence at the discretion of the Courts.Further legislation exists to deal with witness intimidation in the provision of Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence to harm or threaten, or, in any other way, intimidate or put in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation by the Garda Síochána of an offence.  This provision provides protection for those who may be a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings relating to an offence.  The penalty upon conviction on indictment is to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.An Garda Síochána considers every criminal case where the possibility of intimidation of civilian witnesses may be an issue and the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings. In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his or her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have them included in the Witness Security Programme.  This Programme was established in 1997 under the direct operational control and administration of the Garda Commissioner. The programme was established in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system through the use of threats of violence and the systematic intimidation of witnesses.Where an Investigation Team becomes aware of any threat to, or intimidation of witnesses or potential witnesses, such incidents may be addressed through the trial judge, who may decided to revoke bail or put some other sanction on the suspect.  The incident will be subject of thorough investigation by An Garda Síochána and an investigation file will be submitted to the Law Officers.Effective measures have been put in place to deal with serious crime, including Operation Anvil, in which intelligence-led operations have been used to target specific individuals.   This Operation commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and was extended countrywide in 2006.  The primary focus of Operation Anvil is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  In this regard Operation Anvil consists of intelligence-led targeted operations on the one hand, and an increased overt visible Garda presence on the other.  The Garda Commissioner has publicly re-affirmed his absolute commitment to the objectives of Operation Anvil, which is but one tool used by members of An Garda Síochána in endeavouring to combat crime.An allocation of €20 million has been ring-fenced from the Garda Budget 2008 to ensure that ongoing operations of Anvil, which are augmented by other operations and initiatives, both locally and nationally, continue to be undertaken by all units and sections of An Garda Síochána.Multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where all of the National Units from National Support Services such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau are used to combat serious crime. These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and timely information. The Emergency Response Unit has also been deployed in areas where there is a propensity to use firearms.The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target assets accumulated by criminals, in order to seize such assets and to deprive the criminals of the profits of their criminal activity. The Garda National Drugs Unit liaises closely with the Criminal Assets Bureau to target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent. Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  An Garda Síochána will continue with intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the policing of the border area is constantly monitored and reviewed by senior Garda Management and their Regional Management Team. These reviews cover crime analysis, crime trends, policing requirements and resource allocation.An Garda Síochána in co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland is engaging in high-visibility policing along the border.  Additional patrols by uniform and plain-clothes personnel have been put in place.  Furthermore, initiatives under Operation ‘Anvil' have also been put in place to target those involved in criminality, particularly with a cross-border element.   The level of threat from dissident groups is also constantly monitored and assessed.The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by a number of factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each Division.The next allocation of Probationer Gardaí will take place on the 13th of June 2008.  The needs of all Garda Divisions, including all Border areas, will be fully considered by the Garda Commissioner in this allocation within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.The Commissioner in his Annual Policing Plan 2008 proposes establishing some new Garda divisions, the boundaries of which will be coterminous with local authority boundaries.  The reason for these changes is to facilitate both local Garda management and local authority management in the management of Joint Policing Committee as provided for under Section 22(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.As part of the boundary realignment project, the Commissioner is creating a Division of County Louth to make it coterminous with the local authority boundary.  County Louth Division will become part of the Northern Region and will fall within the remit of Assistant Commissioner, Northern Region.  This will more easily facilitate dialogue with the Police Service of Northern Ireland on matters of a policing nature.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The Irish Prison Service publication entitled "The Prison Adult Literacy Survey — Results and Implications" published in September 2003 showed that a significant number of prisoners have very low levels of literacy — 52% of them were at Level 1 or Pre-Level 1 literacy levels.  In other words, more than twice as many prisoners are at the lowest level as compared with the general population.Literacy work has been a strong element of the Prison Education curriculum since the early 1980's and continues to be a priority element of the Prison Education curriculum.  A number of significant initiatives commenced or were strengthened since the publication of that report  which paralleled efforts to address adult literacy in the community.The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and respects the adult status of the student, his/her prior knowledge, skills and life experience.  It is also concerned with improving self-esteem and building confidence.An Adult Basic Education Development Worker is employed with specific responsibility for implementing and supporting developments and initiatives in the area of literacy, numeracy, English for speakers of other languages and basic education.  Because of the literacy deficit of the prisoner population, literacy work forms an element of more than just the timetabled literacy classes.  All teachers are aware of the literacy needs and these are dealt with as part of the general coursework of prisoners.  This is a very effective method of linking the literacy learning programme of prisoners to an area they can engage with and is widely used in adult education.The Irish Prison Service is implementing the new assessment framework devised by the National Adult Literacy Agency; "Mapping the Learning Journey", an assessment framework that identifies learner progress, provides tangible feedback and indicates areas on which to focus.  It is a useful tool for both learning and teaching.Progress has been made linking the education and training needs of prisoners in recent years, with the literacy action plan prepared by the prison education unit of each prison becoming one vehicle for integrating the efforts of the education and training sectors in prisons.  Peer tutoring, promoting family literacy and developing post-release support for prisoners who undertake literacy tuition in prison are also promoted by the Prison Education staff wherever feasible.Each student coming into the Prison Education Centre will have an individual interview to assess his/her educational needs and interests.  Those with literacy difficulties are prioritised and slotted into class almost immediately.  Every effort is made to publicise literacy classes and encourage as many prisoners as possible to avail of classes.While the Irish Prison Service recognises the progress that has been achieved to date, it also accepts that further work is required.  To this end the Irish Prison Service are in the process of appointing a dedicated Literacy and Numeracy Development Officer.  The Officer will be responsible for developing and implementing a strategy, including an action plan to address literacy needs. This appointment will drive the development and implementation of adult literacy policy and practice within the prison environment.

The substance of the letter related to whether or not a prosecution against Dr. A could be instituted here rather than in the Netherlands.  The letter was furnished to the Gardaí, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions advised that the prosecution would more appropriately be dealt with by the Dutch authorities and the Dutch Ministry of Justice was advised accordingly on 22 October, 2004.The letter did not contain any information about Dr. A's background and in particular did not contain any information concerning his occupation.  Accordingly, the question of notifying the Department of Health and Children or other bodies based on the correspondence received could not have arisen.A request for the service of a summons, under the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters,  was subsequently received from the Dutch authorities by the Central Authority for Mutual Legal Assistance. The summons was forwarded to the Garda authorities with a direction for the summons to be served on Dr. A personally in accordance with section 49 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The Dutch authorities were subsequently informed that the summons had been personally served on Dr. A.The role of the Central Authority for Mutual Legal Assistance based in my Department is to transmit and receive requests for legal assistance for the purposes of criminal investigations or criminal proceedings.  It does not have a role in relation to the monitoring for other purposes of the ultimate outcome of cases in which mutual assistance requests have been received. This would be neither practical nor within its remit.The Sex Offenders Act, 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other vulnerable persons against sexual abuse and attack.  It sets out the obligations on persons convicted of a range of sexual offences, making them subject to notification requirements under Part 2 of the Act.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any sex offenders who enter the State.As soon as the Domestic Violence and Assault Investigation Unit of the Garda Síochána is advised by a relevant authority, which could include a foreign law enforcement agency, of the impending release or movement of a sex offender this information is passed to the relevant nominated Garda Inspector.  Should they arise, child protection issues are raised with the health authorities.A Senior Officials Group has been established to examine a range of issues related to child protection.  This Group, on which my Department is represented, will review adherence to the Children First Guidelines, training about the Guidelines and processes and protocols for information exchange.

I intend to bring proposals to Government in relation to the drafting of those amendments shortly.An outline of amendments proposed by the Ombudsman Commission is set out in their two year progress report, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas library or can be accessed on the Commission's website at www.gardaombudsman.ie.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	594	Following the commencement of provisions of the Children Act 2001, as amended, responsibility for children detention schools transferred from the Minister for Education and Science to the remit of my Department on 1st March 2007.  There are currently 4 schools in operation, 3 at Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin and 1 at Finglas, Dublin 11.  As the Deputy may be aware the development of new children detention facilities has been included as a priority of the National Development Plan 2007 to 2013.In March this year, having considered the report of the interdepartmental Expert Group on Children Detention Schools, the Government agreed that all developments of the new detention school service should take place on the Oberstown campus.  This development will include the replacement of older building stock and the creation of sufficient new places to accommodate 16 and 17 year old boys, who will then no longer be detained in St. Patrick's Institution. The Irish Youth Justice Service is consulting relevant stakeholders in preparation for the design phase of the project and is at an early stage in developing its plans.The Government has also agreed to set up a working group to consider a possible future role for the centre on the Finglas site (Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre) which will cease to operate as a children detention school when the new development is completed.Detention is a measure of last resort in responding to youth crime.  It is, however, a necessary measure for the protection of society and to meet the needs of a small number of young people.  The development of detention school services will be based on international best practice and will provide modern, safe and secure facilities for the protection of our communities and to support the rehabilitation of young offenders.

As at 30 April 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of the Unit was 62.Since the publication of the Government's National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources in the fight against illicit drugs have increased.  This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.  In addition, the total strength of the Divisional Drug Units as at the same date was 340.Both the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. Furthermore, all Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to deal with drug related issues as and when they arise.It is of course the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Drugs Units will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.  The Deputy will be aware that in today's world the effective use of resources is contingent on intelligence led operations and in this regard Revenue are currently engaged in assigning a Customs officer to Europol's headquarters in The Hague  and to the recently developed Maritime and Operational Analysis Centre–Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Lisbon.Customs also continue to manage and increase intelligence development by way of the National Drugswatch Programme and liaison with national and international law enforcement colleagues.Revenue's dedicated Customs Drugs Law Enforcement Branch co-ordinates its national and international drugs enforcement operations and implements numerous joint investigations and controlled deliveries of illicit drugs.  In the past three years a total of 73 controlled delivery operations have been carried out in conjunction with An Garda Síochána resulting in substantial supply detections of drugs and numerous arrests and prosecutions of those involved.Finally, on the supply reduction side, the best methods of detecting drug smuggling include intelligence sharing, multi-agency and international co-operation and I can assure the House that both the Garda Síochána and the Customs Service are fully committed to working together in continuing to tackle this societal problem.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 172.Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 April, 2008, 624 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 279 to children.  There have been nine formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, agreed.There were four applications by An Garda Síochána to the courts over the same period — two for a civil order (adult) and two for a behaviour order (child).  These applications remain before the courts.In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for. In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where a court order itself might be sought.  No significance therefore should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where a court order has been issued.  Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, however, they will culminate in a court order being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	597	The Government Alcohol Advisory Group which was established in January last to examine the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol submitted its Report on 31 March.  It contains 31 recommendations for legislative and other reforms in areas covered by its terms of reference.  On 22 April, the Government approved the drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 which contains proposals for urgent reforms to licensing law and public order legislation in response to certain recommendations in the Report. Both the Report and details of the proposed legislation were subsequently published.Publication of the Bill was approved by the Government yesterday and I intend to present it to the Dail in the very near future. I am confident that this legislation will, when enacted, assist the Gardaí in combatting anti-social behaviour and public disorder.The increase in the number of public disorder and anti-social behaviour offences is mainly due to more pro-active policing and the Garda Commissioner's vigorous enforcement policy in respect of such offences.  In particular, it is due to pro-active policing of public parks and the targeting of public disorder ‘hot-spots' in a concerted effort to tackle the concerns expressed by local residents.  Extra foot, bicycle and mobile patrols have been directed by local Garda management in these areas.Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 it is open to me to set policing priorities for the Gardaí.  One of the priorities I have set for 2008 is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder.  I have specified that there should be particular emphasis on alcohol — related offences, including under age consumption of alcohol.Statutory provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour and public disorder.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct in public places and within licensed premises.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of the local authority and senior Garda officers may, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  There are currently 29 such committees in operation in a pilot phase.  In general, the experience to date has been positive with committees identifying and seeking to meet local needs.  Following consultation with my colleagues, the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I intend to issue revised guidelines to enable the roll out of the committees to take place shortly.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 162, 178 and 342 together.The intimidation of witnesses is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 41 specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda Síochána, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.Since 1997 the Garda Síochána has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by complementary legislative provisions in Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  Section 40 makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable upon indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.An Garda Síochána rigorously enforces the provisions relating to witness intimidation and protection contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1999.  In particular, where the possibility of intimidation of witnesses may be an issue, the case is closely monitored throughout the investigation, up to and including any criminal proceedings.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.  Any such incident would also be the subject of a thorough investigation by the Garda Síochána, with a view to seeking directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.The Deputies will appreciate that I cannot go into details about particular cases but I am informed that the Witness Security Programme is being operated in a number of cases at present.  The Garda authorities advise that, not only is it unnecessary to place the existing Witness Security Programme on a statutory basis, but to do so could introduce an element of inflexibility which could hinder Garda efforts.  The operation of the Witness Security Programme should not be measured by the extent to which the funds available have been expended.  Rather it is operated according to the operational needs identified by the Garda Síochána.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of proceedings commenced in respect of the offence created pursuant to Section 41 of the 1999 Act for the years 2003 to date are as follows.YearProceedings commenced2008*12007*12200642200522200430200330*The 2007 and 2008 figures are provisional.

The Charter will set out targeted response times and levels of service the public can expect, including the frequency of high visibility patrols in urban and rural communities.The Garda Inspectorate has been requested to examine the allocation of Garda resources and also to provide advice on the development of a Garda Charter as proposed in the Programme for Government and I look forward to receiving its advice.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 195 together.I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Employee Assistance Programme in An Garda Síochána provides a confidential support and referral service to both serving and former members of An Garda Síochána, their immediate families, and to students.  The service is available to help resolve work or personal issues that are causing stress, worry or disruption to an individual's life, including death and bereavement.  Part of the role of the Employee Assistance Programme is to liaise with and arrange follow up visits with the next of kin of recently deceased members.The Garda Employee Assistance Service also provides a referral service to specialist agencies, where appropriate, and where necessary in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer or the individual's G.P.  The service is available to families of members for referral purposes.Special provisions are also in place for financial support for families of Gardaí killed in the line of duty, including death gratuities, transitional payments, spouses pensions and children's allowances.  The Garda Síochána Compensation Acts 1941-1945 also apply to the families of members who have died as a result of injuries maliciously received in the course of their duty.I am sure that the Commissioner will keep under continuing review the adequacy of the arrangements for the support of families of Gardaí who are killed in the line of duty and I will listen carefully to any further advice he may have in the future.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	602	As part of a general review of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act last year, the extension of the Act to An Garda Síochána was considered.  That consideration involved an examination of all factors relevant to the governance, oversight and accountability of An Garda Síochána.Since the passage of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 An Garda Síochána and the regulatory and administrative landscape in which it operates has been undergoing massive change.  The Garda Ombudsman Commission has been established.  The Garda Inspectorate has been established and has produced three reports with major implications for the structure and operation of the Garda Síochána.  In the past year the senior civilian management positions of Chief Administrative Officer and Director of Communications have been created.  Further civilians are currently being recruited for key posts as Legal Advisor, Director of Information and Communications Technology and Director of Change Management.  At the same time the ranks of attested members and the numbers of civilian staff have been expanding.In light of this extensive and fast-moving change it was decided that to extend the FOI Act to the Gardaí at this time would place an excessive administrative burden on the resources of An Garda Síochána as the Force continues to discharge its challenging core duties, in particular that of tackling crime.  For all these reasons it was decided not to extend the FOI Act to An Garda Síochána at this time, but to keep the matter under review.  In this regard, I intend to be guided by the overall public interest which lies in maintaining an appropriately accountable police force which is not distracted from its key tasks of safeguarding public safety and security.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 139 together.It is the nature of many public order offences that they are only recorded and detected because of the presence of Gardaí. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the increase in the number of public order offences detected reflects the significant increase in the level of Garda activity in this respect under Operation Encounter.Operation Encounter was commenced by the Commissioner in February 2002. The operation specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons.All members of An Garda Síochána proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot-spots by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed at these areas during times when these offences are more likely to occur. All such incidents detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda Síochána are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.  Almost 465,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.One of the policing priorities set for An Garda Síochána for 2008 under the Garda Síochána Act, 2005 is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with a particular emphasis being placed on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities.Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order. In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.Binge drinking is what lies behind many incidents of public disorder and violence.  The problem is not restricted to teenagers or young people and it is fuelling public order problems on the streets.  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group which was established in January last to examine the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol submitted its Report on 31 March. It contains 31 recommendations for legislative and other reforms in areas covered by its terms of reference.  On 22 April, the Government approved the drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 which contains proposals for urgent reforms to licensing law and public order legislation in response to certain recommendations in the Report.  Both the Report and details of the proposed legislation were subsequently published.Drafting of the Bill is at an advanced stage and I intend to present it to the Dáil in the very near future.  I am confident that this legislation will, when enacted, assist the Gardaí in combating anti-social behaviour and public disorder.The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 provides for fixed charge notices to be used for certain drink-related public order offences.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of these provisions is under way with a view to their introduction as soon as possible this year.The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 also enacted provisions to combat anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  A significant number of behaviour warnings have been issued under the legislation — 624 behaviour warnings to adults up to the end of April and 279 to children.  There have also been nine formal good behaviour contracts, which are used only in the case of children, agreed.In addition to the criminal law, a wide range of initiatives is in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  Under the provisions of the Children Act, 2001 the Programme has a statutory basis.Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  There are currently 100 projects operating throughout the country, and it is intended to establish a further 68 projects in the lifetime of this Government, bringing the total number of projects to 168 nationwide.More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area.  There are currently 29 committees in operation in a pilot phase to gain experience rolling the committees out to all local authority areas in the State.  In general the outcome to date has been positive, and the committees are meeting definite local needs.  Issues of public disorder are high on the agenda of the committees.Following on from a consultation seminar last November, work is underway on revising the guidelines under which the committees operate in the light of the experience gained to date.  Following consultation with my Ministerial colleagues, I intend to issue revised guidelines to enable the roll out of the committees to take place as soon as possible.

The reports provided to date were presented to the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and Mental Health and to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The three reports to date were not prepared on the basis that they would be published.I might add that the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 contains a commitment to publish a strategic document on the National Disability Strategy which will outline the vision, mission and strategic objectives under the Strategy. The preparation of this document is currently underway.

Those Acts oblige me, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to refuse to authorise an application for compensation to the High Court where I am of opinion that the injury is of a minor character and was sustained in the performance of a duty not involving special risk.I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government in the near future with the objective of establishing a Garda Compensation Tribunal which will deal with both minor and non minor injuries in an efficient manner and to the satisfaction of all interested parties.

As part of this programme, my Department has also decided to examine individual organisations to ensure they are delivering an economic and effective service.  The review will cover areas of strategic, financial and operational management and the outcomes that these organisations deliver under the criteria of economic, efficient and effective use of resources.The terms of reference generally follow those outlined by the Department of Finance in their guidance on conducting value for money reviews.  My Department is currently finalising the terms of reference for at least two VFM reviews in organisations under its remit.  The Department will carry out these reviews in 2008.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I wish to advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology.  The study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence with one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  The fact that over 50% of prisoners do not re-offend within four years of release, compares well internationally.The Prisons and Probation Services provide a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.  Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multi-dimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reach statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.In addition, the Probation Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner's sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.  The Service also provides supervision in certain cases under temporary release provisions.The Irish Prison Service places a strong emphasis on access to educational services and on the provision of work and training activities for prisoners.  As a result of the Programme for Organisational Change, there has been a significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes.  The Work Training Service comprises an authorised complement of over 250 prison service posts and there are over 90 workshops operating in our prisons actively catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.Educational services are now available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies in the community including the VECs, Public Library Services, Colleges and the Arts Council.  Broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach.  During the academic year 2007/08, 220 whole-time-equivalent VEC teachers were the main providers of these education programmes.The Irish Prison Service is also delivering programmes aimed at reducing the demand for drugs within the prison system through enhanced security measures as well as education, treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-addicted prisoners.  The Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy & Strategy — Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons — caters for the expansion of existing drug treatment programmes and further recruitment of dedicated staff working in partnership with community based services in the prisons.  Particular initiatives include the provision of detoxification, methadone maintenance, education programmes, an information forum, addiction counselling, drug therapy programmes and the operation of drug free units.Every effort is made to assist sex offenders in custody who are willing to participate at any level in their personal rehabilitation and relapse prevention.  In this regard, there are three forms of direct therapeutic intervention currently available — i.e., individual counselling from the Irish Prison Service's Psychology Service and from the Probation Service; the Sex Offender Programme which has been in operation since 1994, and the Psychiatric Service which provides some support to prisoners in this category.Significant progress is also being made in the development of programmes based on risk assessment and rehabilitation needs.  The Irish Prison Service is developing and rolling-out, between now and 2012, a fully coordinated Integrated Sentence Management System (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention.The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  There are currently 29 Committees in operation in a pilot phase to gain experience rolling the Committees out to all local authority areas in the State.  In general the outcome to date has been positive, and the Committees are meeting definite local needs.With regard to youth offending the Irish Youth Justice Service is committed to developing information and data on youth offending in line with its Strategy for 2008-2010.  The Irish Youth Justice Service is also currently contributing to a research project on recidivism and young offenders.  This study follows from the aforementioned study of prisoner re-offending by the Institute of Criminology at UCD.  It will be a valuable addition to the existing research available on recidivism, with particular reference to young offenders.As the Deputy will be aware Garda Youth Diversion Projects are a scheme of community based, youth oriented, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people away from becoming involved — or further involved — in criminal and/or anti-social behaviour.  The projects are funded through the Irish Youth Justice Service and administered by the Community Relations Section of An Garda Síochána.The aims of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects are:To divert young people away from becoming involved — or further involved in criminal and/or anti-social behaviour,To provide suitable activities to facilitate personal development and encourage civic responsibility and social inclusion andTo work towards improving the long term employability prospects of the participants.Projects offer opportunities for education, employment training, sport, art, music and other activities.  Many operate outside of school hours.  In areas with a high proportion of early school-leavers, activities may also be planned during the daytime.Participation in Garda Youth Diversion Projects is voluntary.  The primary project target group, which forms the majority of project participants, is comprised of young people who have entered the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and are considered at risk of remaining within the justice system.  The secondary project target group is comprised of young people who, although they have not been officially cautioned, have come to the attention of the Gardaí, the community or local agencies as a result of their behaviour and are considered at risk of entering the justice system at a future date.  The number of participants in each project differs according to local circumstances and resources.I am also glad to tell the Deputy that the policing priorities which have been set for An Garda Síochána for 2008 under the Garda Síochána Act, 2005 have been reflected in the Policing Plan for 2008.  The first priority deals with targeting gun crime, organised crime and drug trafficking.  It refers to the use, in particular, of specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil; profiling, intelligence gathering and threat assessments in relation to individuals and groups involved in this type of crime; and the pursuit by the Criminal Assets Bureau of the proceeds of crime including through the presence of enhanced liaison arrangements between CAB and Garda Divisions.

Not alone does the Act set out the role of the Garda Síochána in policing the State and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate in benchmarking performance by reference to standards internationally, it establishes the Ombudsman Commission as a key element of the new policing framework.  This role is essential in ensuring that public confidence in the Gardaí is safeguarded.  The independent police ombudsman model which we have here is a relatively new one internationally.  As a result there is a learning process for all the parties involved.  However I am encouraged by the content of their two year report on their effectiveness and the adequacy of the functions assigned to them which concludes that they can report good progress in respect of all of their functions and objectives.I will of course carefully consider any specific proposal the Ombudsman Commission may make, taking into account the developing experience of their workload and the new efficiencies expected to result from legislative change.  I will stay in dialogue with the Ombudsman Commission on how best to continue to meet their needs.  It is not my intention to seek to narrow their remit although I am of course open to the possibility of legislative change to enable them to streamline their processes with a view to optimising their resources.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	611	Our drug law enforcement response remains a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the drugs issue under the Government's National Drugs Strategy.As the Deputy will appreciate, under the National Strategy it is the Customs Service which has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at the point of importation.  Given the nature of drug trafficking, the Customs Service work very closely on an ongoing basis with An Garda Síochána in carrying out this drug law enforcement.In this respect, a framework for co-operation between the Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána with regard to drugs law enforcement is set out in a Memorandum of Understanding which is in place between both agencies.This document was agreed and endorsed by Ministerial approval by the respective parent Departments of both agencies in January 1996.The Memorandum also provided for the creation of operational guidelines implementing the Government decision for the Customs and Excise Service and the Garda Síochána, and in consultation with the Naval Service, to operate a Joint Task Force to deal with intelligence driven drug smuggling operations and "controlled deliveries."In October 2000, the signing and implementation of an operational protocol for co-operation between the three agencies further developed this framework.Under this framework, the Customs and Excise Service and the Garda Síochána support and co-operate fully with each other in connection with the interdiction of illegal drugs intended to be smuggled into the State.As the Deputy will appreciate, the specific issue of resources for the Customs Service is one which comes under the direct remit of the Department of Finance.With regard to this, I have been advised by my colleague, Brian Lenihan, T.D., the Minister for Finance, that he is satisfied that Revenue's Customs Service is properly resourced to tackle drug smuggling.I have been further informed that in recent years there has been considerable increased investment in Customs detection resources.  For example, the number of detector dog teams has increased from 6 in 1996 to 9 in 2003 and currently stands at 12.There has been a significant investment in both maritime resources and x-ray scanning equipment and further investment has already been committed.  The Irish Navy also plays a key maritime operational support role in assisting Customs in drugs surveillance and interdictions at sea.Operational resources are deployed by Revenue using best practice risk management techniques coupled with the latest information emanating from organised crime drug threat assessments.The Deputy will be aware that in today's world the effective use of resources is contingent on intelligence led operations and in this regard Revenue are currently engaged in assigning a Customs officer to Europol's headquarters in The Hague  and to the recently developed Maritime and Operational Analysis Centre –Narcotics (MAOC-N) in Lisbon.Customs also continue to manage and increase intelligence development by way of the National Drugswatch Programme and liaison with national and international law enforcement colleagues.Revenue's dedicated Customs Drugs Law Enforcement Branch co-ordinates its national and international drugs enforcement operations and implements numerous joint investigations and controlled deliveries of illicit drugs.  In the past three years a total of 73 controlled delivery operations have been carried out in conjunction with An Garda Síochána resulting in substantial supply detections of drugs and numerous arrests and prosecutions of those involved.Finally, on the supply reduction side, the best methods of detecting drug smuggling include intelligence sharing, multi-agency and international co-operation and I can assure the House that both the Garda Síochána and the Customs Service are fully committed to working together in continuing to tackle this societal problem.

The extent of those reforms and the speed with which they were implemented are indicative of the level of commitment the Government, my predecessors and the Commissioner attach to the reports of the Morris Tribunal.The Act gave rise to:the establishment of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission,the establishment of the Garda Inspectorate as a source of independent and expert advice for the Minister,a statutory obligation on members to account for their actions on duty without delay,new streamlined discipline procedures,the empowerment of the Garda Commissioner, with the consent of the Government, to dismiss a member of Garda, sergeant or inspector rank where he has lost confidence in the capacity of the member to discharge his or her duty and where dismissal is considered necessary to maintain public confidence in the Force, andnew whistleblowers regulations and the appointment of an eminent former senior civil servant as a Confidential Recipient.A new system of promotions has been put in place. A civilian Chief Administrative Officer (at Deputy Commissioner level) and Director of Communications have been appointed and three further senior civilian posts — Legal Advisor, Director of Information and Communications Technology and Director of Change Management are being recruited at present.The Garda Commissioner has implemented a significant programme of change in response to the findings and conclusions of the Tribunal including for example a new covert human intelligence handling system.  He is also currently engaged in the preparation of a new code of ethics under section 17 of the Act of 2005.The findings of the sixth report are under consideration at present but Deputies can rest assured on the basis of the Government's track record in these matters that they will not be ignored either by myself or the Garda Commissioner.

A preliminary site suitability report has been carried out on the site and this has confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of this site.I can confirm also that the Prison Service Interim Board, in accordance with Department of Finance Guidelines, has approved a preliminary Business Case for this project and has forwarded it to my Department for sanction to proceed to the next stage of the process.  I see the Prison Service moving to the next stage of the process, the preparation of a detailed Business Case, in the near future.  There have been meetings with the local community and future meetings in relation to the proposed development will be held as the project progresses.

Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.The Act further provides that the court may require an applicant to complete a statement of means.  It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.  My Department, in consultation with the Courts Service, is currently reviewing the operation of this aspect of the Scheme.

The Inquiry found that, while the arrest of Brian Rossiter was lawful, his detention was unlawful, notwithstanding that his father consented to it.  The Inquiry found that there was a failure to observe properly certain procedural requirements of regulations governing custody in Garda stations, in particular a failure to record accurately the time at which Brian Rossiter was given information relating to his rights while in custody.  The Inquiry was not satisfied, however, that Brian Rossiter was assaulted in the course of arrest or while he was in custody.  On the question of the information given to ambulance and medical personnel, including the State Pathologist, the Inquiry found no evidence that there was an attempt made to mislead medical personnel wrongfully with incorrect information.  The Inquiry did find, however, that there was a failure to investigate all the circumstances surrounding the death of Brian Rossiter.The Inquiry made no recommendations on future safeguards and procedures. Nonetheless I am considering the findings of the report carefully to see what lessons need to be learned, and how best to deal with any similar circumstances in the future. In addition the disciplinary aspects of the matter are under consideration by the Garda Commissioner.

The Authority is currently operating on a non-statutory basis but will be put on a statutory footing by the Bill.  Property management agents will, together with auctioneers and estate agents, be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the new Authority.The Law Reform Commission has indicated that it will publish, in the coming weeks, its Report on Multi-Unit Developments which, following an extensive consultation process, will contain definitive reform proposals concerning the regulation and governance of property management companies. The Government has already directed that early action be taken by the relevant Departments to address the Commission's reform recommendations; the types of action to be taken will, of course, be dependent on the form that the recommendations take.

To date no application has been received by An Garda Síochána for authorisation of this range.  As of now, neither I nor my Department has any role in the  matter and I have not received any representations with regard to this range.

I am also informed that there are 8 attested members of the Garda Reserve from ethnic minorities with a further 5 in training. There is an ongoing recruitment campaign in place for recruitment to An Garda Síochána and there are targeted campaigns aimed at recruiting people from ethnic minorities with advertisements in several different languages in ethnic newspapers. The language requirements were changed in 2005 so that the absolute requirement to have English and Irish prior to entry to the force was removed and replaced with a requirement to have two languages, one of which was Irish or English.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the numbers of bench warrants, penal warrants and committal warrants which were recorded on the PULSE system as being on hand on 23 May, 2008 are set out in the following table.  It is inevitable in any criminal justice system that at any given time there will be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution. It should be borne in mind too that the vast majority of the outstanding warrants relate to financial penalties, and not to violent crime. The Gardaí continue to give priority to the enforcement of warrants arising in serious cases. Aside from the large volume of warrants being issued, there can also be unavoidable reasons why warrants can take time to execute or, indeed, prove ultimately unenforceable. It is the case that many individuals would be subject to multiple warrants, and many are trying to evade Garda attention through moving to different addresses.Of its nature, it is difficult to be precise as to what level of outstanding warrants at any point in time represents the optimal situation. The amount of warrants outstanding has to be seen partly from the perspective that the strength of An Garda Síochána is now over 13,800.I am further informed that the Garda authorities are committed to strengthening the warrants enforcement process. The Commissioner has raised the issue of the execution of warrants with each Regional Assistant Commissioner and a range of measures, aimed at reducing the number of warrants on hand, have been identified and are being implemented. These measures include the re-assignment of additional Gardaí to this function. I understand that the position is being closely monitored by senior Garda management and consideration is also being given, at an organisational level, to further measures to address the situation.I am also taking a number of steps to deal with this issue. A particular difficulty is that cases relating to the non-payment of fines clog up the courts system, since the Gardaí have to seek warrants to enforce their payment. A pilot project was introduced by my Department, under which outstanding fines were in effect pursued in terms of debt collection by an outside agency, rather than moving directly to the stage where the Gardaí seek a warrant. The result of the pilot suggests that as an alternative method of fine collection this proved successful. The Department, in consultation with the Gardaí and the Courts Service, is considering how best to take this forward.The Third Programme of Law Reform of the Law Reform Commission has been approved by Government and is now underway. It includes an examination of the enforcement of court orders and the service of proceedings in both civil and criminal cases, in particular the procedure for the execution of bench warrants and search warrants. This topic was included because it is recognised that there are significant difficulties in this area at present and that the procedural problems in this area have resulted in inefficient use of resources.The Garda Commissioner and I are aware of the importance of an efficient warrants process and will continue to monitor the operation of the system particularly with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.NumberCommittal Warrants4,016Bench Warrants36,002Penal Warrants77,738

The Garda accommodation programme is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda Síochána and it is brought forward in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), who have responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Officials from my Department, the Office of Public Works and the Garda Síochána have regular meetings to oversee the various projects.  In addition, a high-level strategic Garda Accommodation Board with members drawn from my Department, the OPW and An Garda Síochána has been established to carry out a review of Garda accommodation with a view to preparing a short and longer term strategy for all accommodation.   On a practical level, and with the introduction of various provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, project management matters and regular maintenance issues are dealt with directly between the agencies involved which has led to improved efficiencies and reduced administrative overheads.I have been advised by the Garda authorities that a site has been identified for the new Divisional Headquarters in Portlaoise.  Progress is being made in finalising the necessary legal arrangements and these must be concluded before the development phase of the project can commence.  I am also advised by the Garda authorities that, in the interim, some remedial works are being provided at the existing station.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this year the Government accepted a proposal from my predecessor that it should take over the Spent Convictions Bill 2007, introduced into the Dáil in October 2007 as a Private Members Bill by (prior to his recent promotion) Minister of State Barry Andrews, TD, and adopt it as a Government Bill.  Certain procedural requirements, as laid down in the Standing Orders of this House, must first be followed before the Bill can be debated in Government time. It is my intention to bring the necessary motion to the House at the appropriate time to address those requirements and to give effect to the Government's decision.The Bill reflects the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on spent convictions which was published in July 2007.  The report recognises that securing employment can be a very effective way of achieving the rehabilitation of convicted persons and it seeks to facilitate that objective by the introduction of a procedure whereby certain convictions may be regarded as ‘spent'.  As a result, the report recommends the establishment of a procedure that will allow for the non-disclosure of certain convictions where certain conditions are met, i.e. the convictions may, in those circumstances, be regarded as ‘spent'.  It is important to note that the procedure proposed by the Commission and reflected in the Bill is a non-disclosure procedure that does not entail a deletion of the conviction from the Garda records.The report recommends that:The following categories of offences should be excluded completely from any proposed legislation on spent convictions (i.e. details must always be disclosed): (i) any offence triable by the Central Criminal Court; (ii) any offence under the Sexual Offenders Act 2001; (iii) any offence where a sentence of 6 months imprisonment or more (including suspended sentences) has been imposed by a court.A conviction may be regard as ‘spent' 7 years from the date of conviction where a custodial sentence of less than 6 months was imposed and where the person has not re-offended in the meantime, or after 5 years in the case of a non-custodial sentence.All convictions, including spent convictions, must be disclosed at a sentencing hearing for any subsequent offence and in some non-criminal procedures (e.g. adoption proceedings, vetting procedures involving access to children).The procedure should operate on an automatic basis.  This means that convictions become ‘spent' automatically after the requirements of the scheme have been met, i.e. a person will not have to make an application to qualify for ‘conviction free status'.The report also makes specific recommendations regarding the issue of vetting and disclosure of criminal history for certain purposes.  The Commission recommends that the current Garda vetting system be put on a statutory footing.  The report also recommends that certain sensitive posts would require full disclosure of all convictions, including spent convictions.  It lists the following posts:Any post involving care of children or vulnerable adults,Any healthcare post,Judges, barristers, solicitors, court clerks, court registrars and employees of the Courts Service,Members of the Defence Forces, Prison Officers, members of the Probation Service and An Garda Síochána,Accountants,Director, controller or manager of a financial institution or of any financial service provider which is regulated by the Financial Regulator.Pending the enactment of the Bill, there is, currently, no general provision in Irish law allowing for the deletion or otherwise of criminal convictions from the Garda criminal records.  However, section 258 of the Children Act 2001 (which came into effect on 1 May 2002) provides a limited but significant procedure in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18, once certain conditions have been met.  As a result, the effects of a conviction are limited where the relevant conditions have been met.  The person in question is regarded for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty or dealt with for an offence.  Any individual who comes within the terms of section 258 is not required to disclose the criminal conviction under any circumstances even if asked to do so.  The section is fully retrospective so that it applies whether the offence occurred before or after the coming into force of the section.  It is envisaged that the Spent Convictions Bill would operate in broadly similar terms to section 258 in the case of adult offenders.

It finds that those persons were unlawfully arrested and detained, and that some were mistreated in custody, through verbal and, in some cases, physical abuse.  These arrests followed directly or indirectly from the investigation into the death of Mr Barron, which itself was dealt  with comprehensively in the Tribunal's second report published in June 2005.The report also deals with allegations that interview rooms in Letterkenny Garda Station were bugged and that conversations between solicitors and persons detained in Letterkenny Garda station were secretly recorded by members of the Garda Síochána.  The report concludes that these allegations are false.The Garda Commissioner has unambiguously apologised to those who were found by the Tribunal to have been mistreated. He has appointed an Assistant Commissioner to examine the Report with a view to addressing the findings as they relate to individual members.The report makes a number of recommendations arising from its findings, mainly centred on how improvements could be made to the law and practice relating to the conduct of interviews with persons in Garda custody, but also touching on other aspects of Garda investigations.  The Commissioner has appointed a Working Group to examine any areas of policy, structures, practices and procedures in the Garda Síochána that warrant action arising from the recommendations of the Report.  I will also be giving very careful consideration to these recommendations, and I will consult with the Garda Commissioner on emerging proposals for change.

I am informed that the search which gave rise to the allegation was authorised in accordance with Section 99(1) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005. The intention to search was signalled in advance to senior Garda management who appointed nominated liaison officers in the relevant station to assist with, and to monitor, the search.  Designated Officers of the Commission were accompanied at all times during the search by a member of An Garda Síochána.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The NDVIA is a non governmental organisation which has been campaigning for Government funding for its operations for some years past. Despite its title, the NDVIA does not actually exercise a nationwide co-ordination role on this matter.Prior to the establishment of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, responsibility for matters related to domestic violence within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was assigned to Divisions with a wide number of other responsibilities. Responsibility for this area was further dispersed across a number of Government Departments and agencies. I can inform the Deputy that since its establishment by the Government on 25th June, 2007, Cosc has made significant progress on its remit. For the first time there is now a dedicated, resourced office at Government level with the key responsibility to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The establishment of Cosc was a clear and unambiguous demonstration of the commitment of the Government to the improvement of measures to prevent and respond to these heinous crimes.Less than twelve months since it began its work Cosc has succeeded in strengthening the partnership structures for the development of effective action. Through a series of projects working in close collaboration with government and non-governmental organisations, Cosc is laying a strong evidence-based foundation for a major priority, the first National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.The Deputy may wish to note that, following a negative recommendation by an external reviewer in addition to a thorough in-house examination, Cosc informed the NDVIA it could not support a proposal it had made for funding.  Cosc is already working with all the key agencies mentioned in the NDVIA's proposal in addition to the broader stakeholders in the field.  Cosc intends that the documents produced by the NDVIA will help inform that work and has advised the NDVIA of this.

It contains 31 recommendations for legislative and other reforms in areas covered by its terms of reference. On 22 April, the Government approved the drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 which contains proposals for urgent reforms to licensing law and public order legislation in response to certain recommendations in the Report. Both the Report and details of the proposed legislation were subsequently published.  Publication of the Bill was approved by the government yesterday and I intend to present it to the Dail in the very near future.Apart from this Bill, the Government Legislative Programme provides for publication of a comprehensive Sale of Alcohol Bill later this year.  This Bill will modernise and simplify the laws relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2004, and replacing them with updated and streamlined provisions. Further reforms to licensing law will be considered in that context.Preparatory work on implementation of recommendations of the Advisory Group which do not require a legislative response has also commenced.

The purpose of the Property and Exhibits Management System is to establish a Divisional Property Store in each Garda Division which will manage all property coming into the possession of the Garda Síochána in that Division with a small number of exceptions such as items immediately required for the proper investigation of an offence, items where the owner is likely to be quickly identified or, for health & safety reasons, items that cannot be reasonably stored at the Divisional Property Store, e.g. large machinery.  These items will necessitate secure retention at local Garda stations.The PEMS system is being introduced on a phased basis in every Garda Division and two pilot locations at Store Street and Athlone Garda Stations are now fully operational. The scheme is currently being extended to a further six locations with a further seven locations planned as stores become available for use. Pending this, property coming into the possession of the Garda Síochána will continue to be handled in the manner prescribed in the Garda Regulations, which is subject to audit and inspection.

The operational procedures for the Units are matters for the Garda Commissioner.I am informed by the Garda authorities that under the procedures laid down, RSU members will operate in regular Garda uniform and in marked Garda vehicles.  Where appropriate, RSUs will have the capacity to respond with firearms and less lethal devices and in armed response mode will wear apparel appropriate to that role.

The 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner’s proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with the functional boundaries of local authorities.  The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.I am advised by the Garda authorities that project boards have been established in each division to develop an implementation plan to create and roll-out the new divisions. The relevant Project Boards are managing all tasks associated with the roll-out including the identification of any accommodation requirements at individual stations.The detailed allocation of resources, including accommodation, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide in accordance with operational requirements.  Any additional accommodation requirements will be managed in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, who have responsibility for the provision, refurbishment and maintenance of Garda buildings.

Its main purpose is to replace existing sub standard accommodation and allow greater capacity to avoid overcrowding.  It will do away with the practice of slopping out and other conditions that have been criticised severely both by the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment (CPT) and the former Inspector of Prisons. It will address the pressures on prison capacity in the Dublin area and will have a wide range of educational, workshop and other facilities so that all prisoners can be productively engaged.  In addition by reducing existing pressure on prison capacity in the Dublin area it will give greater flexibility in developing other prisons and its modern design and structure will make a significant contribution in seeking to eliminate the supply of drugs into our prisons.  Accordingly, I am very much in favour of this project.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	636	One of the strategic goals set out in the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy 2007-2009 is to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries and improve road safety. One of the actions identified in the Garda Policing Plan 2008 in support of this goal is targeted intelligence-led operations against offending young drivers.I am informed by the Garda authorities that specific operations are conducted to improve the compliance culture among such drivers and reduce the level of death and injuries in that age group. An Garda Síochána is working with other agencies, in particular the Road Safety Authority, in this regard. Specific areas identified as places where young drivers congregate are targeted to prevent breaches of the criminal law and gather intelligence on those involved in this type of criminality. As a result, uniform members of An Garda Síochána, supported by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel, establish checkpoints and enforce in a highly visible manner the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts.These initiatives have resulted in detections being made for a wide range of road traffic offences, including offences relating to dangerous driving, careless driving, no silencer fitted, L-plates not displayed, identification plates not conforming with legislation, road tax offences, insurance and driving licence offences, speeding offences, dangerously defective vehicles and modified vehicles. Offences detected are dealt with by way of prosecution, fixed charge notice or, where appropriate, through the Juvenile Diversion Programme.In addition to these intelligence-led operations, all uniform members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing the relevant legislative provisions. Regular mobile patrols take place and roving checkpoints are conducted in areas where young drivers tend to congregate.In addition websites are monitored in order to establish where such anti-social activities are taking place with a view to providing an appropriate response. Garda road safety awareness programmes are conducted in schools, third level colleges, factories, workplaces and other facilities, with the aim of educating road users of the obligations on all road users under the Road Traffic Acts and to promote road safety among the target group.Any changes to road traffic legislation, including the introduction of new penalties, is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Transport.

The 2008 Policing Plan contains the Commissioner’s proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  This includes the separation of the existing Wicklow/Wexford Division into two new Garda Divisions of Wicklow and Wexford with Bray and Wexford as the respective Divisional Headquarters.I am advised by the Garda authorities that a detailed programme of work has been developed to implement these planned changes which includes plans for the distribution of personnel resources. Additional resources for the new Divisions are being considered in this regard.  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that plans have been developed locally to ensure that the Garda service delivery is maintained to a high standard throughout the new Divisions including the areas referred to by the Deputy.

The Court has set out useful guidelines on how the position of an Irish citizen child, whose parents are being considered for deportation, should be considered.As it happens, my Department's current practices in this area are broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Court.  Accordingly, the judgment has not had any significant implications in relation to the way that these types of cases are currently considered in my Department.  Any technical changes needed to bring our procedures fully into line with the requirements, as set out in the Supreme Court judgment, are currently being implemented in my Department.

There is no legal obligation on local authorities under these Acts to have equality policies in place. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no statutory powers or obligation to check whether such policies exist.  Such measures are not compulsory but are encouraged as good practice by the Equality Authority through its Employment Equality Review and Action Plan Scheme.The Equality Authority has a broad mandate under equality legislation to combat discrimination and promote equality of opportunity in the areas covered by the Acts.  The Equality Authority may invite a particular business, group of businesses or the businesses making up a particular industry to carry out an equality review in relation to their business, or businesses.  It may also invite them to prepare and implement an equality action plan in respect of that business or those businesses.The Equality Authority may, if it thinks it appropriate, carry out an equality review and prepare an equality action plan in relation to a particular business, group of businesses or the businesses making up a particular industry or sector thereof.  For the purpose of assisting in the conduct of such an audit or examination, the Authority may, with the approval of the Minister, employ one or more persons having qualifications which, in the opinion of the Authority, relate to that examination.The Equality Authority has supported an employment equality review of Leitrim County Council and a similar review of Cavan County Council is currently being completed.  A survey undertaken by the Local Government Management Services Board in 2007 indicated that all local authorities had employment equality policies in place and that 62% of local authorities had equal status policies governing their dealings with clients.The Equality Authority is currently working with the Local Government Management Services Board to promote equal status policies for local authorities and to support them to put such policies in place.

I am advised that as a result of new regulatory, organisational and working arrangements, together with the ongoing programme of modernisation of the prison estate and the addition of new programmes and services, the Irish Prison Service will be in a position to develop and roll-out a fully coordinated Integrated Sentence Management System (ISM) across all prisons and places of detention.Work is ongoing on a range of necessary system supports to facilitate pilot ISM projects at Wheatfield and Arbour Hill prisons during the course of 2008.  Between now and 2012, ISM will be progressively rolled out by the Irish Prison Service across all prisons and places of detention.ISM will involve a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons.  The end result will be a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	643	Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the power to set policing priorities for An Garda Síochána.  One of the priorities set for 2008 is to combat, in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, including behaviour warnings and closure orders.Operation Encounter, which was commenced in February 2002, specifically targets offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which include the sale and consumption of alcohol by underage persons. All members of An Garda Síochána proactively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including offences relating to underage drinking. Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot-spots by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed in these areas during such times when these offences are more likely to occur.  All such incidents, detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda Síochána, are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.  Almost 475,000 offences have been detected since the commencement of Operation Encounter.I am also informed by the Garda authorities that at a recent crime conference for senior Garda operational officers, measures were discussed and identified to ensure enhanced and more uniformed enforcement of liquor laws, particularly in regard to the sale and supply of alcohol to young persons.The national age card scheme of An Garda Síochána has facilitated the Force, in co-operation with the licensed trade, in addressing and combating the problem of underage drinking. The age card scheme allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his/her local Garda Station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor.  The new age card introduced in 2006 has state of the art security features.Provisions for controlling supply to and consumption of intoxicating liquor by persons under the age of 18 years are contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 and subsequent legislation.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which I intend to bring before the Oireachtas shortly, will further strengthen provisions relating to underage drinking. For example, it will provide a statutory basis for test purchasing of alcohol which will assist the Gardaí in their enforcement activities. Parental approval will of course be required in all cases and appropriate safeguards will also be taken to protect the welfare of the young person concerned. The Bill will also provide for increases in fines for certain offences under the Licensing Acts, including the sale and supply of alcohol to persons under 18 years. Moreover, a minimum closure period of two days will apply in future in cases where a temporary closure order is imposed by the court.The Bill will also contain provisions permitting the Gardaí to seize alcohol from persons under 18 years where the Garda believes the alcohol is being or is to be consumed by persons under 18 years. In addition, the Gardaí will have new powers to seize alcohol and to move on persons found with alcohol where there is an apprehension of nuisance or fear for other persons or a likelihood of a breach of the peace. I am also taking the opportunity presented by this Bill to increase the fine levels in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. The Bill when enacted, will significantly increase the powers available to An Garda Síochána in tackling the problems caused by consumption of alcohol.Section 184 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to the public order offences of intoxication in a public place (section 4) and disorderly conduct in a public place (section 5) as an alternative to proceedings being taken in the first instance. I am informed by the Garda authorities that work on the necessary arrangements for the introduction of these provisions is under way with a view to their introduction as soon as possible this year.I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that adequate resources are available to enforce the laws in relation to the sale of alcohol.

At that time, an incident at the prison was under investigation at the request of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a review of security at the jail had been initiated.  The investigation and review reports are being considered by the Irish Prison Service who have, in the meantime, introduced a number of changes including one which stopped the practice whereby prisoners were allowed purchase televisions, through the prison shop, for use in their cells.

The project includes the construction of the prison facilities along with the ancillary infrastructure including services.  The development consent procedure for the development is set out in Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007.  The Notice of Development and Environmental Impact Assessment in respect of the project was published on Friday 29 February 2008.  The closing date for receipt of observations or submissions in respect of the Environmental Impact Assessment was 11 April.A copy of the Notice of Development has been lodged in the Oireachtas library.  The publication of the Environmental Impact Assessment afforded all interested parties ample opportunity to make their views known and have them fully considered prior to a decision to proceed with the development.  The report of the Rapporteur has been published  and the statutory process under which the Oireachtas may grant approval for the development has been initiated.It is intended, subject to Oireachtas approval for the development and the successful conclusion of the contract negotiations, to commence construction later this year.  It is envisaged that the development will take approximately three years to complete.For commercial and procurement reasons it is not possible to provide details as to the likely costs of the construction and fit out costs.  The disclosure of such information is, in any event, not allowed under Department of Finance PPP guidelines.  I can, however, confirm the expenditure which has taken place to date on the project.  The cost of the site acquisition was €29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison project.  In addition to allaying these concerns, the new roadway will provide significant additional benefits both during the construction and operational phases of the project.  The cost of this additional land was €1,305,000.A total of €5,863,895 has been expended to date on preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security and maintenance of the property, studies such as archaeological, topographical, etc., and professional fees including legal and specialist technical advice.

A Memorandum of Understanding is currently being negotiated with the Disclosure Scotland agency with a view to putting in place a reciprocal arrangement for vetting requests.  Discussions are also ongoing with the Criminal Records Bureau of England and Wales to agree a similar Memorandum of Understanding.Details of foreign convictions received from EU States within the framework of European mutual assistance in criminal matters are entered on the Garda criminal records database and they are disclosed in the vetting process of the individual concerned.  Earlier this month the Houses of the Oireachtas agreed that Ireland may take part in the adoption of a proposed EU Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States.  It is expected that this proposal will be submitted for adoption by the Council over the coming months.The proposed Council Framework Decision follows on from the adoption in 2005 by the Council of a Decision on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records which supplements the relevant provisions of the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.

Figures provided for 2008 are provisional, operational and liable to change.The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress. It is expected that in respect of each year the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and the number of proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts. This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years. In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder. Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.There can be considerable difficulties for the Gardaí in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities. This arises not least because none of the associates of such victims will co-operate with the Garda investigate. Nevertheless, the Gardaí are determined to pursue rigorously all killings, whatever their background. In this context I would refer specifically to measures which the Commissioner has introduced to strengthen the investigation of crime.YearRecordedProceedings CommencedConvictions2008*93020072120200626522005222220048432003193120021042200192120001231199912751998421*Figures provided for 2008 to 27 May are provisional, operational and liable to change.

However, to assist the Deputy, what can be said in this regard is that the global illicit drug trade is, according to the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), reputed to exceed billions of US$ annually.  That UN office estimated in 2005 that global seizures for that year accounted for 44% of cocaine production, 28% of cannabis resin, 25% of opium production, 7% of amphetamines and 4.7% of ecstasy.As I am sure the Deputy appreciates, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally. Our drug law enforcement response remains a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the drug issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.  Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures which we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our current National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The National Strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State Mr. John Curran, T.D., is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and has earlier this year begun the process of developing our new Strategy for the years 2009-2016.  This work is currently involving a wide ranging and public consultative process, in which my Department is actively participating, which will fully inform the development of our new Strategy. My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply interdiction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.An Garda Síochána invokes a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:Identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this state.Conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing.Working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade.Working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.This work is ongoing and An Garda Síochána will continue to pursue these strategies and continue to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking primarily through the use of specialist units and targeted intelligence led operations.To further assist in our law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking, a number of new initiatives have been recently introduced. Some examples of this includes the following:The establishment in January 2008 of the Organised Crime Unit onto a permanent footing with full time staff assigned to it. The Unit now has a personnel strength of 70 and in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Gardaí, will continue to implement initiatives such as Operations Anvil and Oak which target criminals involved in the trafficking of drugs.The recently established Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N) in Lisbon, of which Ireland is a founding member. The Centre has the specific objective of intercepting narcotic shipments, in particular cocaine, to the European Union from Latin America.A number of provisions introduced in  the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007  provided for further measures which are enhancing the powers of the Gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling all forms of drug trafficking under review. The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities and this is reflected in An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2008.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The National Development Plan/Community Support Framework (NDP/CSF) 2000-2006 was an integrated investment plan and strategy for economic and social development for Ireland.  It involved significant investment in infrastructure — such as roads, public transport, water and waste services — in health services, social housing, education, industry and rural development.The Plan was implemented through six operational programmes in the Border, Midlands and Western Region. These were the Economic and Social Investment Operational Programme (ESIOP), Employment and Human Resources Development Operational Programme (EHRDOP), Productive Sector Operational Programme (PSOP), Border, Midlands and Western Operational Programme (BMW OP), PEACE Operational Programme and Technical Assistance (administrative support) Operational Programme (TA OP).  It should be noted that expenditure under the Plan has in the main been completed except for EU Co-financed measures which can continue until the end of 2008 under EU Rules.  Therefore, a complete picture of expenditure in the BMW region will not be available until the full year expenditure data for 2008 is reported in the second quarter of 2009.The following table sets out the original forecasts and the expenditure incurred in each operational programme in the region.  As can be seen from the table, total expenditure incurred in the BMW region to the end of 2007 under the NDP/CSF 2000-2006 was over €15.3 billion. However, there has been some over-performance and under-performance of expenditure taking place within and between the programmes. The main difficulties being a large demand led component that did not materialise and a lower than expected private sector involvement rather than a lack of Exchequer resources. The principal reasons are well known at this stage and reflect a slower rate of expenditure as a result of the impact of the slowdown in economic activity in 2000-02 — the early years of the Programmes — and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease which meant that businesses and the agriculture sector were not in a position to put forward sufficient, suitable investment plans in those early years to avail of funding and a lower drawdown of funding for Research and Development projects.It should be noted that national development planning is an ongoing process with investment on regional development continuing under the NDP 2007-13. The BMW region will also receive an EU Structural Funds allocation of €458 million under the programming round for 2007-2013.ESIOPEHRDOPPSOPBMW OPPEACETA OPTOTAL2000Original Forecast704656237421270.92,045Expenditure64149968231001,4392001Original Forecast900658346531280.82,463Expenditure85559712129150.51,8692002Original Forecast1,048652375643280.72,747Expenditure88661413438581.22,0282003Original Forecast1,066580413650290.72,740Expenditure9096131184432712,1112004Original Forecast1,057556425636290.82,704Expenditure1,044594161427390.72,2652005Original Forecast1,088552470636241.22,772Expenditure1,142702157489360.72,5262006Original Forecast1,1366214445782412,804Expenditure1,352737155559260.62,8302007Original Forecast0000000Expenditure43743134171.52372000-2007Original Forecast7,0004,2752,7094,094189618,275Expenditure6,8314,3929572,958158615,303Note: Figures have been rounded.

The State Guarantees Act, 1954 gives the Minister for Finance the power to guarantee the borrowings of bodies which are listed in the Schedule to that act. However, current legal opinion indicates that the mechanism for adding bodies to the Schedule by order may not be in accord with recent court judgements on the need for substantive legislation in such cases.The Minister for Finance also has powers to guarantee the borrowings of State owned bodies, including state owned public limited companies, where such a power is set out in the relevant Acts of the Oireachtas as, e.g. in section 11 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981. In this context, if the Deputy wishes to establish whether such a power exists in respect of a specific State body, I would be happy to provide the information required.State guarantees may also be subject to approval by the EU Commission under the Treaty rules on State aid. In recent years State guarantees have been given only in respect of borrowing by the Housing Finance Agency plc and Córas Iompair Éireann both of which have been approved under EC state aid rules.As at end 2007, the total amount of principle outstanding under State Guarantees stood at €4,498 million of which €4,289 million was in respect of borrowing by the Housing Finance Agency plc. The amounts outstanding under State Guarantees are published annually in the Finance Accounts.

However, we are advised that the crèche could provide 37 full-time places for children, although the number of places could be increased, if some or all of the children were to be cared for on a part-time basis.A facilities management company has been employed by the OPW to manage the day-to-day maintenance, associated utilities, security etc. of the premises but the allocation of space within the premises, is a function which has been retained by OPW.Legal procedures are currently in train for the completion of a licence with a qualified child care operator for the operation of the crèche, and legal procedures are also in train for the transfer of the overall site from Dublin City Council to OPW.

These allocations cover all Departments for the period 2008 to 2012 and are set out on page 91 of the Public Capital Programme 2008.Under the system of delegated sanction it is a matter for the relevant Department or Agency in the first instance to plan for the delivery of infrastructural projects within these targets.  Questions on individual projects and plans should be referred to the relevant Departments.Full details of National Development Plan (NDP) projected expenditure for 2007 and 2008 (both current and capital, and covering both Exchequer and PPP funded projects) were set out in Appendix 3 of the Revised Estimates Volumes for 2007 and 2008. The first Annual Report on NDP Implementation, covering 2007, will shortly be submitted to the Oireachtas.  Information provided by the relevant Departments/Agencies is available on the Public Private Partnership website (www.ppp.gov.ie) in relation to PPP projects projected to cost in excess of €20 million and already in train.  For ease of reference, I will send the Deputy a copy of the relevant pages of each of the documents referred to above.

Several of these measures have already been implemented.  A decision on a Planning Application for complete renewal of Chesterfield Avenue is expected shortly.On a broader front, formulation by the Office of Public Works, of a new long-term Conservation Management Plan for the Phoenix Park is progressing well. To assist OPW in this regard, the process entails first, wide-ranging consultation with the public, interest groups, and relevant State Agencies, and, secondly, engaging with a number of experts from the private sector to assist with drafting of the Plan.OPW expect to be in a position to undertake the next phase of the public consultation shortly when the draft plan, which is well advanced,  is completed. The  feedback from this will then be assimilated and the draft Conservation Management Plan finalised, with the objective of publishing it later this year.

Since 4th May 2008, this infection became a notifiable disease under the Acute Infectious Gastroenteritis category and from that date all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease were published on 22nd May by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in the HSE.  They give national guidance and deal with the isolation of C. difficile ribotype 027 for the first time in Irish hospitals.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	676	I would like to assure the Deputy that tackling Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs), including Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).I assume the recommendations that the Deputy is referring to are the Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease which were published on 22nd May by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in the HSE.  They give national guidance and deal with the isolation of C. difficile ribotype 027 for the first time in Irish hospitals.  They will be a valuable resource in assisting in the prevention, management and control of this infectious disease.  The HSE is considering the Report at present to decide on its implementation.As the Deputy will be aware, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.C. difficile was not, up to now, a notifiable disease and, as a result, it was difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the health care system.  However, it was examined in the Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) in acute hospitals in 2006.  The survey found that thirty-six patients had C. difficile representing 0.5% of patients studied.   In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department instructed the HSE to make C. difficile a notifiable disease and since May 4th all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  The number of cases reported to date is within the range identified in the 2006 Survey.While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	677	One of the key challenges facing the health service is the need to ensure that services are planned and provided in line with the clinical need of the patient.A number of experimental initiatives have been put in place by the Health Service Executive with a view to providing care in community based rather than hospital based settings where clinically appropriate.  The Hospital in the Home Service is one such initiative, along with the introduction of Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, a Rapid Access Service for the Elderly and the GP Out of Hours service.The Hospital in the Home Service was delivered by a private service provider on the basis of a service level agreement with the HSE and was for a period of one year.  This agreement came to an end on the 16th March and was extended by agreement until 11th May 2008.  During the year, the service treated in the region of 2,000 patients at an annual cost of €6.83m.A review of the service was carried out between January and March of this year under an independent Chairperson.  The review made a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation, which has been adopted by the HSE, is that the concept of the "Hospital in the Home" be retained and that the service should be repatriated within existing HSE post-acute care and community services.The HSE is considering the manner in which it can best mainstream the service previously offered by the service provider into the Executive.  In this context the scope and capacity of the Community Intervention Teams in the Greater Dublin Area is being examined by the HSE with a view to absorbing the service.The HSE has emphasised that no patient will be disadvantaged by this decision.

The additional consultants were approved across a range of specialties including emergency medicine, radiology, general medicine, general surgery and geriatric medicine.The initiative is designed to improve the operation of emergency departments by increasing the number of senior decision makers. The initiative should also help to improve GP access to diagnostics and speed up the availability of diagnostic results.The HSE's Service Plan for 2008 includes provision for the progression of applications in line with available development funding.Last month the HSE recommenced the recruitment process for new consultants across a range of specialties. In excess of  120 posts in total have been advertised.  This includes the 60 consultant posts approved in Phase 1 of the 100+ Initiative.My Department has asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to revert to the Deputy on the specific operational issues raised.

I am advised that the Irish Medical Organisation has also balloted its members and that the result will be known in early June. The Deputy will be aware that it has taken almost five years to complete these negotiations and it is therefore vitally important that the new contract is implemented progressively from the 1 September next and that patients quickly see the benefits of the new working arrangements for consultants in tangible ways.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  Details concerning the number of posts available under the revised contract and when appointments will be made are therefore appropriate to the Executive.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	685	Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Cuba in 1999, Ireland has been accredited to Cuba through our Embassy in Mexico City. Ambassador Dermot Brangan most recently travelled to Cuba last month for meetings with a wide range of interlocutors. In 2001, Cuba established a resident Embassy in Dublin, which has been headed by a resident Ambassador since October 2005. The Cuban Ambassador has been very active in seeking to promote links between our two countries based, inter alia, on people-to-people contact and cultural activities.My Department and our Embassy in Mexico City also support the development of such links. In July 2005, the International Joyce exhibition, commissioned by my Department, was opened for display at the National Library in Havana. And of course, an increasing number of Irish people have visited Cuba in recent years. I welcome these developments and I would certainly wish to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Cuba develop further.As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union's 1996 Common Position on Cuba remains the basis of both the European Union's and Ireland's approach to relations with that country. The Common Position was most recently reviewed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June 2007 and will be discussed again at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June. The overriding objective of Ireland and our European Union partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage, but not to enforce by any external coercion, a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.In the past year, Spain has engaged Cuba in a Human Rights Dialogue. Spain has pursued this bilateral dialogue in accordance with the European Union's Common Position on Cuba.In addition to pursuing its dialogue with Cuba's civil society, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities in all areas of mutual interest. In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.  To date, the Cuban authorities have not taken up this offer. However, we remain hopeful that such a dialogue will be established in the future. In this regard, I welcome the fact that a Ministerial-level meeting between the European Union Troika and Cuba was held en marge of the 62nd United Nations General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2007.Finally, the EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Assistance, Louis Michel, visited Havana from 7 to 9 March 2008 following an invitation by the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, Felipe Pérez Roque. Discussions were held on a range of issues, including human rights and the question of dialogue between Cuba and the European Union.

No. 288 of 2007] include the rules for the training of drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods and the obligation on such drivers to hold valid driver training certificates.  The rules are based on the United Nations' European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road ("the ADR Agreement"), which is updated every two years.The Regulations stipulate, by reference to the ADR Agreement, different levels of driver training, depending on whether the goods they are transporting are packaged or are in bulk, and on the ADR Class of substance being transported.  The training covers safety in operational and emergency situations.Apart from ADR Class 1, explosives, which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and ADR Class 7, radioactive substances, which are the responsibility of Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority is responsible as regards driver training.  This training is provided by specialised training providers approved by the Health and Safety Authority, in accordance with the Regulations, and the examinations are administered by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport of Ireland.   Drivers of dangerous goods are obliged to hold a valid certificate to prove that they have passed the relevant examinations.Separately, under the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, employers are obliged to carry out a risk assessment and provide job specific training addressing identified hazards to all employees.   Driver duties must be assessed, and this would include identifying the type and nature of work, hours of work and shift patterns, and assessing the risk posed by the demands this type of work places on individuals.   The employer is obliged to put in place control measures to alleviate stressors in this work activity, e.g. scheduled breaks. If identified, specific training courses may be employed such as defensive driving courses and advanced driving skills courses.The enforcement of those aspects of the Regulations, in relation to which the Health and Safety Authority is a competent Authority, is an operational matter for the Authority.

While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings, or from giving preference to one area over others.The industrial development agencies have a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives in place to promote economic development that will give rise to sustainable employment throughout the country, including County Kildare.The strategies and programmes of the development agencies are very much in line with the National Development Plan and the National Spatial Strategy, which have been specifically designed to overcome any impediments that may exist to economic development and job creation across the country as a whole.Upon taking up office in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I did meet with the Chief Executive Officers of the industrial development agencies who gave me a general briefing on the work of the agencies.  Meetings are held on a regular basis between the C.E.Os of the development agencies and the Minister of the day to discuss the implementation of Government policy.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	690	My Department does not have any role in determining which applications receive assistance from any of the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and does not collect or retain information concerning the number of applications received by each CEB.  Decisions on applications for assistance are made independently by the CEBs on the advice of their Evaluation Committees.  In making recommendations to the Boards the Evaluation Committees are required to have regard to the quality, local relevance, cost effectiveness and viability of proposals as well as issues of deadweight and displacement.  Information on the individual activities of the CEBs are available in their Annual Reports which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas annually.The information concerning the amounts of grants approved, the number of projects approved and the employment places created for the period 2003 to 2007 is attached in tabular format.  The employment data is available on the yearly net increase or decrease in the number of full-time equivalent jobs created in CEB assisted companies.  These figures are collated on an annual basis at year-end and accordingly 2008 figures are not yet available.The specific types of formal CEB assistance available to micro-enterprise is broken down between financial assistance such as grants for feasibility studies, employment grants and capital grants and non-financial assistance ("soft supports") such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education and Women in Business networks. The general levels of available financial assistance are as follows:Capital grants up to a maximum of 50% of the cost of capital and other investment or €75,000, whichever is the lesser; a portion of the grant in excess of 40%( in the BMW Region) or 35% (in the S&E Region) to be in refundable form.Employment grants a grant of up €7,500 per new job, to a maximum of 10 new jobs.Feasibility study grants up to a maximum of 60% (in the BMW Region) or 50% (in the S&E Region), of the cost of a feasibility study and business plan, subject to an overall limit of €6,350 (in the BMW Region) or €5,100 (in the S&E Region).A fundamental review of the role and functions of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the development of micro-enterprises, including the level of financial assistance which they have available to them, was conducted during 2004 on behalf of the Department by Fitzpatricks and Associates, Economic Consultants.  The Review recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed and that there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.  My Department continues to work with the CEBs and the newly established CEB Central Co-ordination Unit in respect of the reorientation of their focus in line with these recommendations.  The forms of assistance, both financial and non-financial, available from the CEBs to their client base continues to be monitored in this context.20032004200520062007CEB ApprovalsGrants ApprovedGrants ApprovedGrants ApprovedGrants ApprovedGrants ApprovedTotals€€€€€€Carlow297,372.00155,268.00300,600.00351,142.00298,853.451,403,235.45Cavan270,075.00189,750.00368,000.00362,945.00439,850.001,630,620.00Clare333,101.00360,830.00318,570.00335,275.00321,610.001,669,386.00Cork City221,047.00284,567.00218,322.00357,444.00345,343.001,426,723.00Cork North—135,000.00———135,000.00Cork South225,596.00330,804.00286,500.00446,000.00593,775.001,882,675.00Cork West120,605.00221,257.00403,402.00239,062.00327,632.001,311,958.00Donegal346,767.00645,120.00593,405.30667,072.00638,475.002,890,839.30Dublin City675,000.00520,500.00707,100.00821,986.001,010,485.363,735,071.36Dublin Fingal423,194.00600,100.00434,000.00601,400.00498,500.002,557,194.00Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown459,065.00700,713.00554,014.00701,529.00814,290.193,229,611.19Galway City & Co.510,056.00505,975.00498,700.00457,107.00521,393.002,493,231.00Kerry532,807.00249,433.00460,281.00508,759.00575,037.002,326,317.00Kildare277,220.00200,174.00319,058.00387,986.00426,100.001,610,538.00Kilkenny285,288.00341,100.00466,473.28412,870.00366,237.921,871,969.20Laois242,072.00243,094.00199,929.00434,126.00283,658.051,402,879.05Leitrim211,589.00179,202.00209,012.00304,275.00298,969.001,203,047.00Limerick City253,609.00193,600.00306,189.00378,125.00227,690.501,359,213.50Limerick County571,900.00299,450.00437,724.00437,756.00297,388.002,044,218.00Longford328,216.00199,500.00235,000.00319,000.00221,183.001,302,899.00Louth242,055.00200,500.00357,740.00319,600.00307,430.001,427,325.00Mayo291,068.00280,898.00437,965.00619,375.00483,250.002,112,556.00Meath182,818.00275,508.00407,664.00317,720.00364,391.531,548,101.53Monaghan251,014.00196,900.00137,300.00317,000.00255,604.001,157,818.00Offaly399,163.00171,990.00420,554.00476,731.00450,299.001,918,737.00Roscommon363,378.00184,975.00361,529.00396,076.00318,973.401,624,931.40Sligo293,825.00267,905.00329,534.00448,537.00418,169.001,757,970.00South Dublin493,329.00587,979.00384,500.00510,000.00650,000.002,625,808.00Tipperary NR244,900.00211,490.00315,051.00295,389.00438,171.001,505,001.00Tipperary SR314,525.00211,550.00261,148.00366,550.00311,550.001,465,323.00Waterford City372,109.00192,949.00265,132.00255,842.00386,140.001,472,172.00Waterford Co.157,475.00324,005.00368,758.00329,062.00359,975.001,539,275.00Westmeath386,152.00228,931.00354,071.00444,653.00506,285.051,920,092.05Wexford401,419.00426,174.00526,043.00466,949.00695,439.452,516,024.45Wicklow794,629.00189,316.00263,773.00284,883.00349,166.001,881,767.00Total11,772,438.0010,506,507.0012,507,041.5814,372,226.0014,801,313.9063,959,526.48CEB projects approved20032004200520062007TotalsCarlow2120242217104Cavan2320362728134Clare3836382932173Cork City1718232620104Cork North020002Cork South131512121466Cork West131824161889Donegal1728262925125Dublin City6147486366285Dublin Fingal3551232524158Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown2646323143178Galway County and City Council6842666163300Kerry5437544249236Kildare231918221698Kilkenny3030322731150Laois2121212534122Leitrim2622242427123Limerick City2520242119109Limerick County2718212415105Longford4424363422160Louth2829412428150Mayo2523233021122Meath2023202227112Monaghan141826132293Offaly3923271934142Roscommon2411242426109Sligo3425243036149South Dublin4427141115111Tipperary NR161517162185Tipperary SR2421212331120Waterford City2822202624120Waterford County1621202122100Westmeath4312342624139Wexford3839322734170Wicklow162123221799TOTAL9918649488949454,642CEB20032004200520062007TotalsCarlow50-246086.532.5205Cavan-571336456.5125.5322Clare275368682.5114.5594Cork City7611-2410231304Cork North-4-412867.579.5Cork South527-25-14.59486.5Cork West-80536022.5762.5Donegal223407-34175.52451,016.5Dublin City323-17198273.533.5811Dublin Fingal44951374125.5351.5DunLaoghaire/Rathdown-24784-4852171.512.5Galway City & County2424813032223675Kerry-2916263159103Kildare-59256242147.5217.5Kilkenny-10863109127.5-81110.5Laois345669663228Leitrim53445428.5-34.5145Limerick City28-394234.5105.5171Limerick County30722015-23.5113.5Longford-1295236.555140.5Louth457822054-95302Mayo16915211046315Meath-128469284.5296.5Monaghan138-1390164.568447.5Offaly868650-3497.5285.5Roscommon6832548559298Sligo26-20-4162.54370.5South Dublin8-117187824.511.5Tipperary NR25351920.525124.5Tipperary SR9665-4047.5122290.5Waterford City120-1326242.5-34.558Waterford County-1945416329.5159.5Westmeath-61163100481287Wexford14772103587.5486.5Wicklow63-6782-18.59.569Totals1,4591,3411,9382,0452,266.59,049.5

The marketing of individual areas, including Kildare, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.The Minister of the day receives invitations on occasion from Enterprise Ireland to partake in trade missions abroad in order to promote Irish exports.  The Minister is also invited to accompany IDA on itineraries abroad to assist in marketing Ireland as a location for new and expansion investments.  These visits are usually focused on specific sectors.Should a company express an interest in investing in Ireland it is ultimately their decision regarding where to visit and/or locate.  However, IDA Ireland will assist all prospective investors with a range of incentives and supports, including finding the most appropriate property solution.  Should a potential investor decide to visit a specific area there may be a role for the local County Manager to assist IDA in its marketing effort by also outlining the supports available from the local authority.

In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland's strategy for Wexford is to promote the county as part of an integrated South East region and is focusing its efforts in the Hub & county town of Wexford.IDA Ireland is also actively encouraging new investment in the services and knowledge-based industries and has achieved notable successes in Wexford, evidenced by the existing quality of the companies already located in the county, such as Equifax and PFPC.IDA is currently developing its 26 hectare Wexford Business and Technology Park as part of a national property development programme to ensure the availability of international standard property solutions for potential investors into the future.  IDA also has a further 4.5 hectares available in Wexford at sites in Gorey and Enniscorthy, as a means of continuing to build on the emerging international services and financial services activity in Wexford.Enterprise Ireland's activity in County Wexford is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies and also through enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and third level institutions.Another incentive available is the Enterprise Platform Programme, a one-year rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business.  The Enterprise Start Programme, which was developed by Enterprise Ireland and FÁS to help potential entrepreneurs to develop their new business ideas into business plans. The programme is aimed at individuals with new business ideas in technology or knowledge intensive sectors that are capable of achieving export sales.The development of community based enterprise centres is a crucial element in the drive to create new regional enterprise. On 19 November 2007, under the first round of this new €21m CEC Competitive Scheme, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Micheál Martin T.D. announced a €6.74m investment in 22 Community Enterprise Centre projects. In 2007 Enterprise Ireland approved grant aid of €300,000 for an extension to Enniscorthy Community Enterprise Centre.The Spirit of Enterprise is a regional initiative that aims to bring all the agencies and bodies that have an interest in enterprise promotion in the South East together. There is a regional steering group in place for "Enterprise Week" and at county level there is an organising committee. The committee for county Wexford are currently putting their programme for this year's event in place. It is hoped that through this organized approach that greater dissemination of the message about the importance of entrepreneurship and the range of supports that are in place for new enterprises.The Wexford County Enterprise Board (CEB), since its inception in 1993 to the end of 2007, has approved over €8.3m in grant assistance to 732 clients. This intervention has made a significant contribution to job creation in Wexford. Throughout 2008 the Wexford CEB will continue to support enterprise development in Wexford through the provision of both direct and indirect assistance and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development at county level.FÁS offers a range of training courses and services to individuals in County Wexford who are seeking upskilling and employment. The Competency Development Programme, aims to raise the competency level of employees to ensure that the national skills match the national human resource requirements for continuous economic growth and enable employees to cope with frequent and on-going changes in work practices. FÁS are currently running two apprentice electrician courses in the Wexford Training Centre with a total of 26 participants, with additional classes planned to run from July to December this year. Adult training courses in basic computer applications, office skills and engineering multi-skills, are also in the pipeline for the near future.I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the agencies under of the aegis of my Department together with the Government's commitment to regional development will continue to bear fruit for the people of Wexford and the South East region as a whole.

The Cork Centre forms part of the Radio Products Division of Freescale's Wireless and Mobile Solutions Group (WMSG).Freescale is a large global company that routinely makes adjustments to resources as a normal course of operations to meet changing business requirements in a very dynamic industry.  Freescale has decided to streamline its cellular design and as part of this decision, is proposing that all programs in its Cork design facility be transferred to other locations and the facility be closed.  The closure of the facility expected in September 2008, will result in 47 employees losing their jobs.Freescale is entering into a consultation process with its employees in Cork this week where details of redundancy and options for employees will be outlined.  A number of employees may be relocated to other global sites and it is understood that Freescale will offer an enhanced redundancy package to impacted employees.IDA Ireland is working closely with local Freescale management in Cork to help secure alternative employment for impacted staff.  FÁS will be in contact with the management of FreeScale this week and will make arrangements to register the employees.  The full range of FÁS services will be made available to the employees.IDA Ireland's Strategy for the South West Region and County Cork is to:Work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure in the region;Progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment;Work with the existing IDA client base and to help them to further develop their presence, andProvide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure.Cork has a long industrial tradition and in recent years has grown into a strong gateway with a strong presence of international companies with significant operations located throughout Cork City and County.  In particular there has been a large concentration in both the pharmaceutical/medical technology sectors and in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.  Recently, there has been a shift towards software, customer support and shared services activities, collectively known as Globally Traded Business.Over the past 10 years, direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork City and County has grown from 14,838 in 1998 to 20,114 in 2007.  The sectors contributing to this growth are ICT, Pharmaceuticals/Medical Technologies and Globally Traded Business.  IDA Ireland has over the last three years approved new projects for the Cork area with a job potential of over 3,100 at full operation.  There are currently 134 IDA supported enterprises in Cork City and County.  Recent announcements of new overseas companies locating in Cork include Blizzard, SolarWinds and Apex.  These projects will significantly add to the value and depth of the overseas industry in Cork.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage the expansion of their operations.  The success of this is demonstrated by the recent expansions of several companies in the county including Citco, Vmware, Eli Lilly, Trend Micro, GlaxoSmithKline, PepsiCo and Sanmina SCI.

Such a request may also, with the consent of the employee, be made by the employee's representative. NERA inspectors may also at their own discretion conduct such an investigation.Where the investigation is at the request of or on behalf of an employee, the Inspector will advise the employee of the outcome of the investigation.The Act also provides that an employee or employer, or the representative of either of them with their respective consent, may, subject to certain conditions, refer a dispute concerning an employee's National Minimum Wage entitlement to a Rights Commissioner. However, a dispute cannot be referred to or dealt with by a Rights Commissioner where the employer is or has already been the subject of an investigation by an inspector or prosecuted for non-payment in respect of the same alleged underpayment.The Rights Commissioner will, as soon as practicable after hearing a dispute,  advise the parties, in writing, of his or her decision. A decision by the Rights Commissioner may include an award of arrears and reasonable expenses of the employee in connection with the dispute and require an employer to remedy, within a specified time or in a specific manner, any breach of the National Minimum Wage Act. An appeal against a decision of a Rights Commissioner may be referred to the Labour Court.An employer who refuses or fails to pay an employee the National Minimum Wage is guilty of an offence and is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,904.61 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment. Conviction on indictment can lead to a fine not exceeding €12,697.38 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.If the offence of which a person was convicted is continued after conviction, the person shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the act or omission constituting the offence continues, and for each such further offence the person shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €253.95 or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €1,269.74.Where, in a prosecution for an offence, it appears to a court that money is due by an employer to an employee, and the employer is convicted of that offence, the court may, if it is satisfied that the employer is liable to pay to his or her employee an amount of money, order, in addition to any penalty which it may impose, that the employer pay the amount to the employee.Proceedings in relation to summary offences under the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 may be prosecuted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Any amount of money due to an employee from his or her employer under or in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 is also recoverable by the employee as a simple contract debt in a court and action for its recovery may be instituted and maintained on behalf of the employee by the employee's trade union, if the employee is a member.The Minister may also, in certain circumstances, institute civil proceedings in the name and on behalf of an employee for the recovery of arrears arising from a breach of the National Minimum Wage Act.The minimum level of pay in respect of certain specific sectors or industries is provided for either in Employment Regulation Orders or Registered Employment Agreements made under the auspices of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts. These include such sectors as construction, catering, electrical contracting, hotels, security, contract cleaning, hairdressing, retail grocery and agriculture.Complaints in relation to non-payment of the minimum rates of pay provided for under Employment Regulation Orders may be made to the National Employment Rights Authority's Inspection Services. An employee, the Minister or a NERA inspector may initiate proceedings in respect of failure to comply with the minimum wage conditions of an Employment Regulation Orders. Such proceedings may include provision for the recovery of associated arrears.The enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may be effected through the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with the Agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the Labour Court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of the Agreement it may by order direct compliance with the Agreement.Failure to comply with an order of the Labour Court is an offence punishable by a fine. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may bring proceedings in relation to such offences.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may also bring proceedings in respect of, among other matters, non-compliance with the terms of a Registered Employment Agreement. NERA Inspectors may also bring civil proceedings on behalf of an employee to recover arrears arising from non-payment of the minimum rate of pay provided for in such agreements.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The Department supports government policy which aims to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland. Our payment strategy is designed to ensure that cost effective arrangements are in place for making payments to social welfare customers by using a range of payment options and to ensure that new payment facilities are made available to customers as they arise.The Department is implementing a three year strategy to change paper based payment instruments to electronic payments at post offices, banks and other financial institutions on a phased basis. Currently some 74% of customers receive their payment electronically direct to their post office or financial institution.A range of measures are underway to inform customers of the change in payment methods and to address any concerns they may have regarding the use of the social services card to collect their payment at post offices.Each person is being informed by personal letter of the change in their payment arrangement. A social services card, along with a covering letter explaining how to use the card, is also being issued to them. Posters are being displayed in all post offices, citizen's information centres and throughout the Department's local office network.For those customers who cannot collect their payment in person, the Department has arrangements in place to allow a nominated person collect their payment using a Social Services Card.I am confident that the planned range of measures to inform customers of the change to electronic payment will ensure a smooth transition for them.

The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week in June 2006.Budget 2007 provided for new arrangements whereby people can receive a maximum payment equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance while receiving certain other social welfare payments.The back to work allowance scheme enables social welfare customers to return to the workforce in either paid employment or self-employment and retain a proportion of their social welfare payment over a number of years.  One of the qualifying conditions for the back to work allowance is that the person must be engaged in full-time employment of at least 20 hours per week.  For this reason the back to work allowance is not payable with half-rate carer's allowance.Carer's allowance recipients who have ceased caring duties may be eligible to apply for the back to work allowance.I have no plans to change the position in relation to the back to work allowance scheme.  However, I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure that commitments in relation to income support are delivered.

He was awarded Disability Allowance from 11 July 2007 at a personal rate of €43.30 per week as he was assessed with means of €144.92 per week from an Incapacity Benefit Claim from the United Kingdom (UK).His claim was reviewed in February 2008 and he was awarded an increase in his personal rate to €60.80 per week from 19 September 2007 and  €72.80 per week from 2 January 2008.His claim was further reviewed in May 2008.  He was assessed with means of €119.31 from his UK Retirement Pension and has been awarded an increase in his personal rate to €80.30 per week from 28 may 2008.Where persons are paid in foreign currency, the means are assessed by reference to the value in Euro currency. If the payment is in a currency of a member state of the EU, it is dealt with in accordance with EU law. Social security schemes in the European Community and the European Economic Areas are co-ordinated by Council Regulations (EEC) No. 1408/71 and 574/72.Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 contains detailed rules which co-ordinate rights granted under the different National legislation while Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 contains detailed rules for implementing Regulations No. 1408/71.Article 107.1.b of Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 states that the rate for conversion into a national currency of amounts denominated in another national currency shall be the rate calculated by the Commission and based on the monthly average, during the "reference period" of rates of exchange of currencies published by the European Central Bank. There are four reference periods each year on which conversion rates are calculated, these are:January for rates of conversion applicable from 01 April followingApril for rate of conversion applicable from 01 July followingJuly for rates of conversion applicable from 01 October followingOctober for rates of conversion applicable from 01 Jan. followingDisability Allowance is a means tested scheme. The mechanism used in assessing the means in this case, which were derived from a British Pension, is as outlined above.The person concerned may request a review of his claim at any stage by submitting up to date payslips for his UK Retirement Pension, however, he may gain or lose, depending on the circumstances.

Six companies, including the agency referred to by the Deputy, were contracted following a public tender process to provide services on a regional basis for the period June 2004 to end May 2007.  These contracts were extended, initially, to the end of 2007, and then, to the end of May 2008, in order to complete a consultation process with Projects on the future of the Programme.  My Department cannot extend these publicly procured contracts on an indefinite basis and tenders for support services will be advertised publicly in the very near future as part of the development of future support services for the Programme.In the interim, projects have been afforded some flexibility by providing them with the opportunity to procure services that best meet their own training and development need.

This includes almost 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997.SNAs are sanctioned by special education needs organisers to schools specifically to assist in the care of pupils and students with disabilities in an educational context, in line with my Department's circulars.The Deputy will be aware that SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles. SNAs provide care support to pupils with special educational needs who have been assessed as having such needs while teachers deliver education to the pupils.  I have no plans, at present, to formally extend the SNA role to be that of a para-educator.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department has recently commenced a value for money and policy review of the special needs assistant scheme. It is expected that the review will be completed during 2009.

As this is a recent development it is not intended to reduce the school's allocation for this school year.All primary schools have recently been asked to complete an application form for the allocation of Learning Support/Resource Teaching posts for the 2008/2009 school year. This school has been asked to omit these hours from the school's application.  The school has been informed that if it did not have sufficient hours within the cluster to retain the 2nd post, that my Department will review the schools case at that stage.A full review of the schools allocation for the 2008/2009 school year will be carried out on receipt of the school's completed application for the Learning Support/ Resource Teacher posts (LS/RT1 form).

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The level of student intake to the Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of and demand for primary teachers.In recent years the approved level of intake to the Bachelor of Education (Primary Teaching) has been 1,000 annually. All colleges providing Bachelor of Education courses are State funded and tuition fees are not levied on students.In addition, some of the State funded Colleges of Education run an 18 month Graduate Diploma in Education course. This is a full-time course which enables third level graduates to train as primary teachers.  The Deputy will be aware that for the intake to the 2008 post graduate diploma in education my Department approved an additional 210 places to bring the total allocation to 490 places.The on-line Graduate Diploma in Primary Education, provided by Hibernia College and accredited by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) is a part time course and allows third level graduates to continue working while studying for their teaching qualification.  The Graduate Diploma conferred at the end of this course, is recognised by my Department for the purposes of primary teaching.I understand that the cost to students of the post graduate course in the Colleges of Education and Hibernia College are similar.  Participants on these courses may avail of tax relief under section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.The intake into the Colleges of Education will continue to be kept under review by my Department to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 314, inclusive, together.There is currently no requirement for primary schools to submit copies of itemised bills to my Department.  Section 18 of the Education Act, 1998 and Section 19 of "The Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure" handbook sets out the responsibilities of boards of management for maintaining school accounts.I am aware of the cost pressures on schools, including those arising from water charges, and it is for this reason that it is a priority for Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. Specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions of the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of schools and primary schools in particular.Primary schools are now getting over €178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs — an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of €105 and €15 more per child than they got last year. Post-primary schools have also seen improvements in funding and through a similar €15 increase this year now receive €331 per pupil. As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to doubling the capitation grant for primary schools over the lifetime of the Programme for Government.In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as fixing easily identifiable leaks. Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund such measures. The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some €27m issued to primary schools at the end of last year for that purpose.The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced. By virtue of good water conservation schools can be in a much stronger position to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets. Guidance was also recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme. Furthermore those schools with very high water consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing measures to help them reduce water usage.My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for schools.

The school in question has not been selected for designation as a developing area school.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage to construction phase will be considered in an ongoing basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of these projects at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	715	It is the policy of my Department to ensure that payments due to companies in respect of services, including those referred to by the Deputy, are made as expeditiously as possible.  The Deputy will appreciate that queries may arise in specific cases that need to be resolved before payments can issue.  These may arise in cases in which invoice amounts differ from the amount approved by my Department or are not forwarded promptly to my Department by schools.  If approval to rent accommodation is given to a school, the contract is between the supplier and the school.  Accordingly the school is invoiced by the supplier and in turn the school is funded the cost by my Department.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to issue payments due at the earliest possible date.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	717	My Department received an application on behalf of the project/organisation in question to be considered for funding in 2008 under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme.  In assessing applications for funding, consideration is given to Department supported interventions already in place in the areas concerned so as to avoid duplication of effort and resource. My Department currently supports the educational element of eight Teenage Parenting Support Projects under the Health Services Executive's Teenage Parenting Support Initiative in Galway, Limerick, Louth, Coolock, Donegal, Carlow, Cork and Dublin and it would be inappropriate to support a second initiative in an area which provides a similar service to the same target group.Funding has been committed in 2008 to the 8 Teenage Parenting Support projects as a specific gender element of the School Completion Programme under DEIS in preventing early school leaving among teenage mothers.  Links have been established between local School Completion projects in these areas, assisted by the SCP National Co-ordination Team and the Teenage Parenting Support Initiative Coordinators.  The aim of these projects is to enable young women who are pregnant and young mothers to stay in second level education and to progress on to third level education or training.  The Project does this by providing individual support, information and grinds where necessary.  Young people participating in Teen Parenting Support Programmes are targeted in-school, out-of-school and in higher or further education, giving them the opportunity to reach their full potential through continued participation in education and training.  This will improve their life opportunities and reduce the likelihood of the young family experiencing poverty and social exclusion and being long-term dependants on State support.  The process of determining my Department's financial allocations to the Youth Work Sector for 2008 is still under way.  I expect that this process will be completed shortly and all Administering Agencies, in this instance Youth Work Ireland will then be notified of the outcome as appropriate.

With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008.  Accordingly, there is no Summer Works Scheme for 2008.  However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.

These applications raise significant issues regarding Government policy towards higher education, in particular the existing roles of the Universities and Institutes of Technology which have distinctive missions from each other, provide different levels and types of academic programmes, fulfil different roles in the community and have separate academic and governance structures.  The Government wants to build on our strengths and to provide an environment where all our higher education institutions can develop in a way that best serves the country as a whole and the regions where they are based.  These issues will be central to consideration of the appropriate next steps in relation to all applications on hand, including the one from Waterford Institute of Technology.

However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  I will give consideration to such a meeting when I have fully examined issues relating to funding and other aspects of the School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	722	The student services charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services.  The charge, which is €825 in the current academic year, does not represent the total allocation towards student services from institutions' budgets.  As the Institutions are autonomous, they determine the internal disbursal of funding, including funding of student services.  Students who are eligible for means tested student support have the charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the VECs, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant to which they are entitled.  The Higher Education Authority issued a Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services to the publicly funded Higher Education institutions in 1998.  Particular reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  The HEA has periodically written to all institutions to remind them of their function in relation to the student services charge and requesting confirmation that correct procedures are in place, in accordance with the framework of good practice.  I understand from the HEA that it recently wrote again to all institutions in relation to the charge reminding them of the framework.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 233 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website, www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007-08 school year is a Principal and nine mainstream class teachers.  According to data submitted by the Board of Management of the school the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2007 was 229 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department’s website and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008-09 school year will be a Principal and eight mainstream class teachers.  Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) on my Department's website.  The school referred to by the Deputy lodged an appeal with the Primary Staffing Appeal Board.  The appeal was heard at the Appeal Board meeting on 20 May 2008 and was unsuccessful.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 22 May 2008.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

Members of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) are not "employees" or "workers" in the generally accepted meaning of those terms.  The Defence Acts 1954 to 2007 prescribe that the Defence Forces shall consist of a Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and a Reserve Defence Force.  Members of the Permanent Defence Force are engaged in the service of the State on a full-time basis and are in receipt of pay and allowances accordingly.  The RDF is a part-time, voluntary organisation whose primary activity is training.  Members are free to determine their own level of participation in Reserve activities and may resign from the Reserve at any time.  Their service is provided entirely on a voluntary basis with no compulsion to attend.  Members of the Reserve undergo both paid and unpaid training.  In addition, there is provision for a gratuity to be paid to those members who meet certain attendance criteria.

Typically, this would cover injuries sustained on official duty while participating in annual camp, field days, overnights, exercises, parades and courses of instruction.  Compensation is payable under the scheme where it is established that a member of the RDF has been disabled as the result of injuries sustained in the course of his or her duties.  However, no compensation is payable where injury or death is caused by the member's own serious negligence or misconduct, or where alternative compensation is otherwise received for the same injury.  The scheme does not extend to training injuries sustained in their own time outside periods of military activities.  I am informed by the military authorities that a Reserve Defence Force Physical Training Policy is being developed.  This policy will address the range of issues and challenges associated with raising the standard of physical fitness in the RDF.  A Physical Training Pilot Programme for RDF units has been introduced for 2008 and an RDF Physical Training Leaders Course is planned for July 2008 to support this pilot programme.  The military authorities have informed me that members of the RDF may avail of PDF facilities subject to the same Health and Safety restrictions that apply to members of the PDF.   There are no plans to pay for gym subscriptions for members of the RDF.

As part of this enforcement policy, members of An Garda Síochána carry out planned and unplanned checkpoints, including those carried out under Operation Anvil and those for the purpose of Mandatory Alcohol Testing.In the Dublin Metropolitan Region, as part of Operation Anvil, almost 94,000 checkpoints, consisting of uniformed and plain-clothes / armed and unarmed personnel, have been conducted since the Operation commenced in May 2005.Mandatory alcohol testing (MAT), which was introduced by the Road Traffic Act 2006, is increasing the compliance culture among road users.  By detecting incidents of drink driving, it is reducing road traffic fatalities and deterring incidents of alcohol-impaired driving by systematically selecting drivers and assessing their level of alcohol related impairment.  MAT checkpoints operate in conjunction with general enforcement of drink driving legislation.In the recent past, An Garda Síochána have undertaken targeted campaigns directed at use of alcohol and drugs by drivers (December 2007), non-wearing of seat belts (February 2008) and compliance by heavy goods vehicles (March 2008).  They will undertake further such campaigns and other initiatives, including specific operations at holiday periods, in the light of what is considered necessary.

The position in relation to granting long-term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five-year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years, may also apply for long-term residency.  This particular long-term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long-term residency.While applications for long-term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long-term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in November 2007 and an acknowledgement has been issued to him.  I understand that applications received in September 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

Members of the local Community Policing Unit allocated to this area liaise with the local community providing crime prevention and security advice.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of the ongoing problems of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in the area concerned. There were 64 incidents of criminal damage to motor vehicles recorded in the area referred to in 2008 to date and seven arrests have been made. Garda investigations into these incidents are ongoing and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.Policing strategies have been put in place under the Divisional and District Policing Plans for the reduction of criminal damage and public order incidents. These strategies include specific initiatives targeting such criminal behaviour utilising the Community Policing Unit for high visibility and intensive patrolling.Additional Garda patrols, including patrols by District patrol car, District Detective and Drug Units and the Mountain Bike Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel, have been directed to pay particular attention to this area, with a view to ensuring a visible Garda presence.Local Garda management liaises closely with the local authority in ensuring the enforcement of relevant legislation in the locality, including the Dublin City Council (Prohibition of Consumption of Intoxicating Liquor on the Street and in Public Places) By-Laws, 2000.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property and drug-related crime, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. Specific initiatives and special operations are put in place when analysis of criminal behaviour and crime trends indicate that such measures are necessary. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

The 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains the Commissioner's proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  This includes the establishment of a new Kildare Division with Naas as the Divisional Headquarters. The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.I am advised by the Garda authorities that project boards have been established in each division, including one in Kildare, to develop an implementation plan to create and rollout the new divisions. The relevant Project Boards are managing all tasks associated with the rollout including the identification of any accommodation requirements at individual stations. With regard to Kildare, the research is well advanced and will identify any structural realignment required within the Division.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 344 together.I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.The membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual's membership of such gangs.  It is therefore not possible, without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and resources, to attribute specific figures to the membership or activity of such gangs.An Garda Síochána utilises intelligence-led operations to target organised crime groups on an ongoing basis.  All available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units to target particular groups.  A large proportion of organised criminal activity is associated with the illicit drugs trade.Organised Crime is being targeted on a number of fronts, involving uniform and plain-clothes Gardaí overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of criminal activities, and profiles of the personnel of such groups are continually updated.  Their members, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted through intelligence-led operations, primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.  A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently, with firearms being recovered and drugs seized resulting in a number of people from these organised groups being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.Measures have been put in place to deal with serious crime including Operation Anvil which commenced in May 2005 in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and was extended countrywide in 2006. The primary focus of Operation Anvil is the disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  In this regard Operation Anvil consists of intelligence-led targeted operations on the one hand and an increased overt visible Garda presence on the other.  The Garda Commissioner has publicly re-affirmed his absolute commitment to the objectives of Operation Anvil, which is but one tool used by members of An Garda Síochána to combat crime.An allocation of €20 million has been ring-fenced from the Garda Budget 2008 to ensure that ongoing operations of Anvil, which are augmented by other operations and initiatives both locally and nationally, continue to be undertaken by all units and sections of An Garda Síochána.Multi-agency approaches have been, and continue to be used where all of the National Units from National Support Services i.e. the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau are used to combat serious crime.  These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section who assist with intelligence briefings and timely information.The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target funds accumulated by criminals, in order to seize such assets and to deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity.  A dedicated unit within the Garda National Drugs Unit has been established to liaise with the Criminal Assets Bureau to particularly target those criminals and criminal groupings believed to be deriving profits and assets from drug-related criminal activity.This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent. Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.An Garda Síochána will continue with intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.

Prior to the enactment of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 as amended, extradition between Ireland and England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland was governed by Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 as amended.Under Part III of the 1965 Act, outgoing requests were forwarded by the Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department did not have a role in this procedure.  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that there were 23 outgoing Part III requests to the United Kingdom in 2003; out of the 23 requests, 15 persons have been extradited and 8 cases are pending.In relation to European Arrest Warrants (EAWs) the information provided in the "surrendered" and "refused" columns relates to the year of the decision and not the year of transmission of the EAW.

The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution allows for bail to be refused to a person charged with a serious offence, where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to this Amendment and also tightened up the bail regime generally.  One of the provisions of this Act is that an offence committed while on bail is to be treated as an aggravating factor when sentence is being imposed by the Courts.  Since 1984, a sentence imposed for an offence committed while on bail is to run consecutive to a sentence for a previous offence.New powers were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2007 including a requirement that applicants for bail may have to provide a statement of their means, their previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail.  Part 3 of this Act also provides that a Garda Superintendent may give an opinion that bail should be refused on the grounds that the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence if granted bail.  The prosecution authorities were also given the right to appeal against decisions to grant bail or, where it is granted, the conditions attaching to it.I am keeping all aspects of the operation of our bail laws under review.

A number of other projects have also been identified as being potentially suitable for PPP.  Overall, the seventeen projects are expected to yield some 1,500 social housing units, 2,000 affordable units, and 4,000 private units over the coming years.  A further project involves the procurement of 1,000 properties on long-term leases in the Dublin region for the Rental Accommodation Scheme.The following table gives a breakdown of the projects and their current status in terms of the procurement process.ProjectSocial unitsAffordable unitsPrivate UnitsOther facilitiesContract stageBallinode, Co.

It is expected that similar information in respect of 2007 will be published in July.Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993. These Regulations are currently being reviewed with a view to updating them as part of an Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of rental accommodation.  I expect to be publishing revised regulations in July.In addition, my Department is providing significantly increased funds from the proceeds of tenancy registration fees to support local authorities in their inspection functions relating to the private rented sector.  Over €7m has been provided to local authorities for this purpose since 2004, and I expect to provide further increased resources in respect of 2008, linked to actual inspection performance.

The Irish Masters of Foot Beagles applied to my Department in December, 2007 for a licence to hunt hares with a pack of beagles for the period 1 March to 31 March 2008.My Department has had concerns for a number of years that the hunting of hares in the month of March could have an adverse effect on the breeding season for the species.  Accordingly, in granting a licence in respect of March 2007, my Department advised the Association that for conservation reasons, licences to permit the hunting of hares with beagles beyond the general open season for the species may not, in future years, be granted, as this would impinge on the breeding season of the hares.  It was also pointed out that in planning their calendar for future years the Association should work on the assumption that all beagling events would need to be scheduled within the standard open season for the hunting of hares, which runs to the end of February.  It would appear the Association did not take account of my Department's position regarding holding such events outside the open season for hares in submitting their new application.A decision to refuse a licence to the Association for March this year was conveyed to the Association by letter of 21 February, 2008.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	753	As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I have overall responsibility for the legislative framework governing development contribution schemes.Under sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted by the elected members of the authority.In addition to the legislative framework my Department has also issued updated policy guidance on development contributions, in the form of circular letter 5/07 which specifically addresses the issue of "double charging".  All local authorities have been advised that any development contribution already levied and paid should be deducted from the subsequent charge so as to reflect that this development had already made a contribution.  A copy of the circular letter is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.It should also be noted that the fact that a developer has made an application for retention permission under section 34(12) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is not a defence to a prosecution for unauthorised development and a development carried out without planning permission, or in breach of planning conditions, remains unauthorised unless and until retention permission is granted.  Section 162(3) of the Act provides that no enforcement action under Part VIII of the Act shall be stayed or withdrawn by reason of an application for retention of unauthorised development.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	754	Planning and development control is governed by the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and the associated Regulations.Unless otherwise exempt, advertising in streets and public places is subject to the submission of a planning application in accordance with the provisions of Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Under the legislation, the decision as to whether or not to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority.  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.Section 4(2) of the 2000 Act provides that I, as Minister, may, by reason of size, nature or limited effect upon its surroundings, by Regulation, provide exemptions for a particular class of development provided that development is not contrary to the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.Part 2 of the Second Schedule to the Planning and Development Regulations (as amended) provides that advertisements, such as those exhibited at the entrance to any business or trade premises, are exempt from the need to apply for planning permission, subject to specified conditions and limitations.  Such exempted development signage is subject to a licence fee payable to the planning authority.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	756	The Greener Homes Scheme provides support to homeowners to invest in a range of domestic renewable energy heating technologies including solar panels, biomass boilers and stoves and heat pumps.The Greener Homes Scheme is being kept under regular review, and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing technologies and market developments, including the consideration of additional technologies such as wood log gasifiers.The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices.  Continuing the scheme is helping secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.  We will continue to review and amend the terms of the scheme to take in new technologies to improve installation standards and to reduce the grant provisions where technologies have become commercially viable.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-05-28 00:00:00	Prelude	758	Transport is one of the fastest growing sectors in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  It is widely acknowledged that transport is one of the most difficult areas in which to affect a reduction in CO2 emissions.  Biofuels offer one potential means to counter rising emissions levels in the transport sector.  The recent EU proposals setting the biofuel obligation targets for 5.75% in 2010 and 10% by 2020 have included the provision that any new fuels have at least a 35% emissions reduction and have to show that they come from sustainable sources which do not destroy natural habitats.  Biofuel production and use will enhance security of supply and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to direct CO2 benefits, biofuels offer opportunities for waste recycling as biofuel production can use this waste oil as a feedstock.  The development of a supply line of alternative fuel supplies which would still be available should there be a disruption to essential oil supplies is essential so that we can continue to provide basic services in such circumstances.Recent events have shown us that biofuels are not without their complexities.  The diversion of food crops into biofuel production has been one factor in the recent rise in world fuel prices.  There has also been concern that new biofuel production has lead to the conversion of natural forest systems into crop production.It is for this reason that we will ensure that our expanding use of biofuels must take place within the context of the EU sustainability criteria regime, currently under negotiation.The European targets will not be pursued in a manner which threatens the long-term food security of the developing world.By establishing the longer-term targets early, and announcing our intention to move to a biofuels obligation, we aim to create a level of long-term certainty for potential investors, particularly in second-generation biofuels.  These new technologies offer the potential to generate fuels from a number of feedstocks which would not be competing with fuel supplies.  A public consultation on Ireland's biofuels obligation will be launched shortly and we will be encouraging all stakeholders to input into this process.
