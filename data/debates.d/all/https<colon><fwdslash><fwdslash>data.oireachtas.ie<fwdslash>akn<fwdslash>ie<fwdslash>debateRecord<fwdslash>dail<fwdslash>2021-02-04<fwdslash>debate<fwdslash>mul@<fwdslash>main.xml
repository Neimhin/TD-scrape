          <p eId="para_1">Before we start, it is very difficult when Deputies approach as we are just starting the prayer and starting the session. I remind Members that there is a pandemic and a distance to be kept. That is the first thing. Second, when the Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle is approached as we start the session, it is extremely difficult to concentrate on what is in hand. I will start the session and, if Deputies wish to put their names down to speak on Questions on Promised Legislation, I will take their names as best I can.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2">I thank the House for allowing us time today to discuss the very important issue of mental health during and beyond Covid-19. I welcome the opportunity to restate my own and the Government’s commitment to the continued development and enhancement of mental health services and supports, from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist services.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> The pandemic has been very challenging, and some people are finding it more difficult than others. Financial and employment worries have caused anxiety and the disease itself has caused significant stress. This has been exacerbated, in many cases, by isolation and bereavement. While the Government’s overall focus is on reducing Covid numbers and ensuring the safe and effective roll-out of the vaccine, our citizens’ mental health needs, particularly for those already vulnerable to or with existing mental health difficulties, remain a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> At the outset, both the Department of Health and HSE mental health services put in place, in the safest environment possible for staff and service users, a range of proactive responses to provide for any rise in service need. Our approach to Covid-19 risk mitigation and infection control in mental health services has been systematic and structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> Residential services were quickly identified as the highest risk areas for staff and service users. The Department tasked the Mental Health Commission with developing a risk control and monitoring framework for residential mental health facilities to identify and address infection risks. The commission collected Covid data and reported weekly to the Department and the HSE on the suitability of premises, preparedness, training and equipment levels. From this process, many facilities were reconfigured to single rooms to reduce the risk of cross-infection and into possible Covid and non-Covid areas. In addition, staff training, personal protective equipment, PPE, provision and testing were implemented to recommended levels. As a result, HSE residential mental health services have continued throughout the pandemic. There has been reduced capacity in some settings to ensure staff and service user safety, and there have been some outbreaks, but the protocols and procedures in place have reduced the impact of these as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> In this current episode, case numbers in mental health facilities have started to reduce, in line with national figures. Although suspected and confirmed staff and resident cases are still too high, HSE mental health services have worked tirelessly with public health to mitigate the spread of the virus. A tripartite oversight group, comprising representatives from the Department, HSE mental health services and the Mental Health Commission, was established to monitor outbreak control. It continues to monitor and identify issues and risks, find potential solutions and follow up as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> With respect to vaccine roll-out, the HSE has undertaken to prioritise vaccination of those over 65 years in residential settings, including mental health facilities. The majority of the 46 units with residents over 65 years have now received the first dose of the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> At this point, I would like to remember the 28 people who have died due to Covid while resident in a mental health centre. I believe that, without the work on outbreak control, the situation could have been much worse in our residential services, and I commend the dedication of staff, the HSE, the commission, the Department and families of residents who all worked to keep infection rates down and our people as safe as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The Department also introduced two pieces of emergency legislation to protect staff and people in hospital for mental health treatment. The first allowed mental health tribunals, which review involuntary detentions, to be held remotely and with one person if staff pressure led to unavailability. Luckily, these measures have not been required so far. The second provided for patients to be transferred temporarily from the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum to the new Portrane facility to allow for a Covid isolation facility in Dundrum during the second quarter of 2020. Those involved have since moved on to other accommodation in line with their care and treatment plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Community mental health teams continue to provide services following rapid reconfiguration and with adaptations in place to protect service users and staff. Significant supports are in place and telehealth services are fully established, with online psychosocial supports now embedded in service provision. Seven-day telehealth services include <i>yourmentalhealth.ie,</i> the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline 50808 and NGO partners’ online supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> It must be noted that availability of staff has been a significant issue throughout the pandemic. Mirroring national services, most cases of Covid-19 have been among staff and this has added pressure to our mental health services. </p>
          <p eId="para_12"> While we do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and any subsequent demand on services, it is acknowledged that there have been increased presentations in certain areas, especially in first episode psychosis and eating disorders. I am particularly concerned about the rise in eating disorders among girls and young women.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> I have met numerous times with the HSE regarding the mental health national clinical programmes and launched models of care on mental health and intellectual disability and ADHD in recent weeks. The programmes and models of care will facilitate significant service improvements and will ensure consistent delivery of high-quality mental health services that can be replicated nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I am pleased to say that the 2021 budget allocation will enable continued development of the programmes, including the national clinical programmes for early intervention in psychosis and eating disorders. Funding to enhance eating disorder services will be allocated this year for the recruitment of staff to enhance and establish specialist teams in addition to capital works. I am fully committed to ensuring that this money is spent in full and translates into real improvements in service provision for people with eating disorders.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The HSE psychosocial framework, published in January this year, acknowledges the pandemic’s impact on mental health in all areas of society. It aims to mitigate longer term effects and sustainably support the mental health and psychosocial well-being of both the public and healthcare workers through targeted actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> We need to maintain psychosocial supports to protect the mental health and well-being of all our citizens. This year, 2020, saw the Government provide €1.1 million for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign and a further €1.1 million for a psychosocial campaign. This funding sought to address potential demand from the public, front-line health professionals and people with new or existing mild to moderate mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Online counselling supports have been developed and include those provided through NGO partners such as MyMind, Turn2Me and Jigsaw. As an example, MyMind delivered nearly 10,000 free online appointments in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> While the numbers of people accessing <i>yourmentalhealth.ie</i> and NGO partners’ websites seeking information and supports have increased in some instances, there is still some unused capacity in this area. The Department and the HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Currently, data show no evidence of a significant increase in self-harm presentations to emergency departments. It is too early to speculate on suicide figures, which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, reports each June following coroners' verdicts. However, early international evidence indicates no increase in suicide, with a decrease in self harm-suicide attempts earlier in the pandemic. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously as we await more up-to-date analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Implementation of Sharing the Vision is proceeding and the national implementation and monitoring committee, which I established late last year, is meeting monthly. The committee will drive reconfiguration of mental health services, monitor progress against outcomes and begin delivering the commitments in Sharing the Vision. The policy is closely aligned with Sláintecare’s vision of the right care in the right place at the right time. It aims to create easier access to multidisciplinary, user-centred supports in primary care, focusing on early intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Of the additional €50 million secured as part of budget 2021, €23 million is allocated to commencing implementation of many of Sharing the Vision’s short-term recommendations. Fifteen million euro will assist with Covid-19 challenges. There will be more step-down beds and extra resources for community mental health teams as well as reconfiguration of facilities, in line with Mental Health Commission recommendations. There will also be a focus on enhancing digital mental health supports and increasing additional capacity in private sector approved centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> In addition to this significant investment, the national forensic mental health service will be relocated this year from Dundrum to Portrane. This follows the passing of legislation which I brought through the Oireachtas before Christmas. In that regard, I would like to thank all the Deputies for their support.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The review of the 2001 Mental Health Act, which has involved many stakeholders over quite a few years, is concluding and the heads of the new Bill will be ready to publish very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I acknowledge the tremendous efforts and sacrifices our citizens have made to follow public health advice and mitigate the spread of Covid-19. I encourage everyone to link with the Government's well-being campaigns, including Keep Well, which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, will speak on now, to promote physical and mental well-being in the safest possible ways.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Frankie Feighan)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">The pandemic has posed particular challenges for all of our citizens in terms of their mental health and well-being. As part of our response to these challenges, we have provided guidance and support for people to manage both their physical and mental well-being through public health information campaigns such as our In This Together campaign and through information networks, including key organisations working with vulnerable people.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Following on from the In This Together campaign, in November of last year we launched the Keep Well campaign, which is aimed at supporting our citizens through this difficult winter. Significant funds are being invested into this initiative, with €7 million to support the delivery of a range of actions and support services. The campaign encourages us all to do something that is good for us each day or week, like going for a walk, connecting safely with friends or family, engaging in a hobby or reaching out for the supports that we may need. By doing so, we will create balance, routine and resilience.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The campaign is focused on five main themes, the first of which is keeping active<b>
						</b>and being outdoors, even during the winter. Physical activity can be very helpful in improving mood and reducing anxiety, in addition to keeping us all fit and healthy. Sport Ireland is leading a series of initiatives that will support us to keep active and to exercise within our own local areas throughout the winter. In addition, sporting organisations and clubs have been invited to develop ways to support local communities within the public health regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Second, staying connected<b>
						</b>with people, addressing isolation, supporting volunteerism and initiatives that support person-to-person connection is important to our well-being. Isolation of people of all ages is a significant risk during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly during periods of tight restrictions on movement and social interaction. The Community Call programme was introduced in the spring to provide local helplines through local authorities for practical supports, information sharing and befriending. As part of the Keep Well campaign, this has been expanded to be proactive, with outreach to potentially isolated persons as the main aim. We are also working with partner organisations, including An Garda Síochána, NGOs and Volunteer Ireland. There is a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting those most at risk of isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Third, switching off and being creative or learning something new, getting back to nature and finding ways to relax can also be really beneficial for general well-being. We also look at the local authorities and libraries, with advice from Creative Ireland, and working with partners at national and local level, we are providing a range of initiatives to support individual and community creativity in the arts, crafting, culture and heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"><b>
						</b>The fourth theme is eating well.<b>
						</b>By nourishing our bodies and minds, we can develop a better connection between the food we eat and how we feel and positively impact our physical and mental well-being. Bord Bia is providing information and resources to support healthy eating this winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The fifth is minding your mood. Under this theme, people can access information on where to go if they need support. This is also linked with the local community helpline to ensure that people can access the help they need. That includes a series of Minding Your Wellbeing online videos, produced by the HSE, which provides an opportunity for people to learn more about key elements of mental well-being such as mindfulness, gratitude, self-care and resilience. Additionally, the Children and Young People's Services Committees in every county across the country are developing and delivering youth-specific campaigns to support young people’s physical and mental health and well-being at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I want to touch briefly on what is being done for homeless people, including those with a dual diagnosis. A further €11 million has been provided for Covid-19 measures in the HSE winter plan and Covid-19 pandemic plan introduced for people who are homeless. This funding will ensure the Covid-19 protective and responsive measures for people who are homeless are continued for all of 2021.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarkWard" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Mark Ward<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">I will use approximately four minutes initially, allow three minutes for the Minister of State to reply and an Teachta Donnelly will come in after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Under this Government we have gone from a mental health crisis to a mental health emergency. There are 2,500 children and young people waiting for child and adolescent mental health services. More than 8,500 children are waiting for a primary care psychology service. Behind each of those figures is a child with a family who is being left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> When will the Government provide the early interventions that are key to a child's development and stop failing our children? Since 2017, under Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Governments, 242 children have been admitted into adult psychiatric services, with almost 30 of those children admitted in the first ten months of last year. When will this Government stop that draconian practice and stop failing our children yet again?</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I ask for clarity from the Government as to when the HSE service plan will be released. Many organisations in the charities sector have got in touch with me. They are waiting to find out if there will be sufficient levels of funding this year to be able to provide essential mental health services in our communities. NGOs and the communities they serve need urgent clarity on that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The Government and the HSE have entered into a surge capacity deal with private hospitals. The deal between the HSE and private hospitals will allow the health services to use up to 30% of private hospital capacity. Why did the Government fail to deliver the same deal for mental health provision during Covid-19? I have written to the Minister of State and asked her to consider this solution to help with the mental health emergency people are experiencing right now. This would take pressure off public hospitals, which are dealing with the Covid-19 emergency, and it would provide essential care for people suffering mental health problems. People suffering with mental health problems are still arriving at accident and emergency departments because they have no alternative service. The accident and emergency department is not the right environment for anybody experiencing a mental health episode.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I acknowledge the Minister of State's response to my correspondence in which she stated that she would investigate the use of surge capacity for mental health purposes. What stage is that investigation at? When will the decision be made? People need help right now and they need access to emergency mental health care on a 24-7 basis in order to get the care they need when and where they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There has been mention of people suffering from eating disorders but such people would benefit from this surge capacity right now. There are currently only three beds in the State reserved for adults with eating disorders. The Government has failed in its promise to deliver specialist eating disorder teams in each of the nine community healthcare organisation areas. I welcome the Minister of State's comments on new funding coming down the line next year but people need help right now. Could surge capacity be enabled for people suffering from eating disorders?</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> Funding for mental health as a percentage of the overall health budget has fallen from 16% in the 1980s to 6% in 2019. I got a response to a parliamentary question this morning that indicates the spending was 5.2% of the overall budget last year and it will fall again this year. During a national emergency, it is an absolute scandal that the percentage allocated to mental health spending has fallen. Sláintecare recommends 10% of the health budget should go to mental health services and international best practice recommends up to 16%.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The Government announced in its budget last year an additional €4 billion for health spending, which is very welcome, but mental health services received just 1% of this additional spending. People are sick of the platitudes when it comes to mental health. The "we are all in this together" brigade is not washing with people any more. When will the Government put its money where its mouth is and bring mental health spending up to international standards? We are a First World country with a Third World mental health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Who in the HSE has budgetary control of the funding for mental health? The programme for Government indicated that the reappointment of a HSE director for mental health would be examined but why has this appointment not happened? I also welcome the news about the monitoring committee for the Sharing the Vision policy. Has an implementation committee been set up to implement the 100 recommendations in Sharing the Vision? The news I have heard is that it has not been set up. Mental health services seem to be the very definition of a Cinderella service and without mental health, there is no physical health.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_43">I thank the Deputy for his questions and he has asked about quite a lot. I will try to cover as many matters as I can and we can get back to him in writing for the questions we miss.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I acknowledged the letter he sent about surge capacity in the private hospitals. The HSE has engaged with private mental health hospitals over the period of the pandemic to provide for additional capacity. The additional capacity includes the purchase of acute beds, as well as longer-term care beds that free up capacity in the statutory sector. The HSE has set up a project to provide for four cohorts of users in acute units. The HSE has met six different providers in the past couple of weeks and the plans are ongoing. We always use capacity in the private sector to supplement the beds we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> The Deputy had questions on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the primary care waiting list. The Deputy knows I secured an extra €23 million for CAMHS in the budget and there will be 29 more whole-time equivalent staff members as a result. I want to tackle the CAMHS waiting list. There has been a significant reduction in the Cork and Kerry area in the past six months, and that should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> On the primary care waiting list initiative, I have had several meetings with representatives of the HSE primary care policy unit and we are giving consideration to options for developing an intervention to reduce the number of children on it. I am very concerned about this list. I met the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last Thursday to discuss funding and work is ongoing to progress the waiting list initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The Deputy asked about children and teenagers under 18 in mental health facilities for older people. The Deputy is well aware that figures were well reduced last year but I have said on record many times that one child in such services is one too many. I am working hard on that. We will get back to the Deputy on the rest of his questions if that is okay.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_49">In her statement, the Minister of State indicated the vision for care is the right care in the right place and at the right time. I refer her to a case that developed in my constituency last week. I was contacted by a mother who was upset and distraught about her son, who had a mental health breakdown. The emergency services and gardaí were called before an armed response unit was eventually called to try to deal with the case. The person was brought to Connolly Hospital, where he was told he would be admitted. Unfortunately, the unit there was locked down because of Covid-19. He was told he would get a service somewhere else and although he waited all day, that did not materialise. He was in the accident and emergency department for three solid days before staff eventually told him it was not an appropriate place for him, and that was absolutely correct. Unfortunately, there was not a single bed available for him in the entire State. The man was told to go home and his mother asked what would happen if another episode took place, as he was still in a distressed state. She was told to call the gardaí, which is completely unacceptable in this day and age. It is also at odds with the Minister of State's speech, which spoke about the right care at the right time and in the right place.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> I said I would come here to speak on behalf of that man and his mother, as well as the countless others whose experiences I hear of on a daily basis. Even last night I was out for a walk and spoke to a person who manages a centre who said the same thing about its service users. I am pleading that the Government activates that surge capacity, if it is there, for a mental health service. I got a call last night informing me the St. John of God service was also in lockdown. People who were able to be discharged were discharged but it was taking no new patients. We need surge capacity for the people who are really in desperate positions. Their families may be in desperate positions as well and they do not know where to go. We do not know where to tell them to go either.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I thank the Deputy for his question. As he knows I cannot comment on an individual case but if he wants to forward to me the details, we are quite happy to have the unit take a look at this. The premise of Sláintecare is the right care at the right time in the right place. That is what we all aspire to deliver. There are currently many challenges and some of the units had to close because of significant Covid-19 outbreaks. As I stated earlier, I am thankful we have only lost 28 people in mental health facilities over the past year but, unfortunately, many staff are out on Covid-related breaks. This has an impact on whether units can remain open. If the Deputy wishes to refer that case to me, I absolutely encourage him to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">I will raise several matters in the short space of time but I have one specific question for which I will leave time for a reply. Covid-19 has exposed many gaps in our mental health services. We always knew there were significant gaps but they have been exposed even more. I have spoken to many people but never seen such levels of worry and depression across so many different cohorts in our country. It is affecting all of us but particularly certain cohorts and I will speak about some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The levels of social isolation, loneliness, anxiety and work pressure - or pressure from a lack of work - are really coming home to roost. I met a young man yesterday who goes for two 10 km runs each day as it is the main activity keeping him going. I am deeply worried about the time younger people are spending online into the early hours of the morning. If they are of schoolgoing age, they may not be able to deal with schoolwork.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">There are some significant issues that will cause us problems for many years. There are some good things that have come out of Covid, including video therapies. They should be used more often and should be expanded into the future. However, in respect of our young people and those working from home, I have serious worries and concerns about the legacy of what is happening. Working from home is of huge benefit to all of us and to our country, but there is an always-on culture. By God, in this House we could all do with learning from it. The always-on culture needs to be addressed, because social media is taking over our lives. I know it is not in the Minister of State's area, but we also need the right to switch off. We have produced legislation on this issue. The right to switch off for people who are working from home must be prioritised when we get on top of this pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> On the issue of elderly people, my mother turned 80 during this pandemic. At the beginning of last year she was about to go on her 15th consecutive trip to work in the orphanages in Belarus. There is a marked difference between her life standards at the beginning of last year and the beginning of this year and in what she can do, as somebody who is the most active person in the community that I can think of. There are hundreds of thousands of people like her. The impact that is having on the mental health and well-being of elderly people is incredibly bad and sad. They are the group of people who have paid their taxes and have done everything. I really feel that there must be intervention mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I want to raise an issue concerning those who are bereaved. Unfortunately, I lost my mother-in-law very suddenly in the last couple of weeks. This issue was brought to attention by my colleague, Deputy Sherlock. I have now experienced it, along with my wife and her family. It concerns the amount of bureaucracy in respect of having to contact so many different State organisations in the case of bereavement. We should forget about politics. I ask the Minister of State to lead the charge on this issue. It is Deputy Sherlock's idea. There should be a one-stop-shop whereby if somebody passes away, family or next of kin can register the passing as part of a central process and it can be filtered out across all State agencies and potentially utilities also. I would be very happy if the Minister of State would commit to that today. It is an excellent idea and it would help people who are dealing with bereavement. During the pandemic, it is much worse. I have experienced it myself. It is so hard to grieve. It has such a lasting effect on people's mental health in respect of the loss and the continuous process of grieving, which goes on much longer and in a much more difficult way, because of Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> There are two final issues I would like to raise. My colleague, Eoin Barry, from Laois, who works in the area, has raised the issue of eating disorders. He has seen a significant increase in eating disorders during the pandemic. Obviously, the period from a psychiatry diagnosis and the length of service requirement afterwards is quite long. I ask the Minister of State what has been done on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Finally, I would like to raise a local issue. There was a recent case concerning a middle-aged lady with some psychiatric and addiction issues. The family situation was not good and she kept coming back to the house, being taken away by the police, put in an ambulance and sent to University Hospital Limerick. Over the course of a few days, this happened repeatedly because she was not being sectioned. I know that it is difficult to section people. Where there are serious addiction issues, this cat and mouse game cannot go on, whereby a person is taken away by gardaí, the person cannot or should not be put in a cell, he or she is sent off to an acute setting in a Covid situation and then the person is sent home. I will pass the details onto the Minister of State. It is happening all over the country. It is ridiculous.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">This is an important debate. I welcome the Minister of State and the speech she made. We all have concerns in this House about Covid-19 and the impact is it having on people's mental health, in particular, in respect of the passing of people. I agree with Deputy Kelly on the point he made about family losses. Unfortunately, I lost my brother-in-law, Joseph Quinlan, yesterday to Covid. He was a great man for watching Tipperary play hurling and a very good husband. I know that other people here have also lost family members. I know the tragedy and the loss that is to everyone. If there is one thing that is clear from all of this tragic loss of life, it is the commitment and the supports given by medical staff, namely, doctors, nurses, nursing home staff and healthcare assistants. It is phenomenal and fantastic. It is deeply appreciated by all the people I have spoken to who have lost loved ones. They are aware of the impact that Covid must have on the capacity of staff to deal at 100% with the care and the love that they offer to their patients. We must offer any necessary additional supports to healthcare staff, whether they are ambulance staff or healthcare assistants and so on. It is a huge burden on people, given their work commitment, professionalism and dedication.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The other point I wish to make concerns those who have passed in this tragic Covid pandemic. We must make a significant contribution to recognising the sacrifices they have made through a day of national commemoration or remembrance. It is hugely important to show that these families are not alone and the community does care. We must show how much we care in terms of our State and society respecting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I know time is short, but I have one question for the Minister of State. There will be increased anxiety among those aged over 70 now in relation to the AstraZeneca vaccine that they are not going to get. I have had communications already this morning from people over 70 who are worried and concerned. They were concerned anyway. I ask the Minister of State what reassurance she can offer them to ensure that they will get the vaccines that have been identified for them, namely, the Pfizer vaccine and so on, and that they will get them as quickly and effectively as possible. They are already deeply stressed and worried about their situation, particularly given that as they get older, their systems do not respond as well in terms of immunity. I ask the Minister of State to address the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryButler" eId="spk_12" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
          <from>Deputy Mary Butler<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_63">First, I offer my condolences to the Deputy and his family on the death of his brother-in-law, at what is a very difficult time. As Deputy Kelly stated earlier, it is very difficult when only ten people can attend a funeral. Considering all the hoops that must be jumped through in normal times, it is most difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> On the question the Deputy raised, there is increased anxiety in respect of vaccines. Yesterday we heard that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not being recommended for the cohort of people aged over 70. The high-level task force is meeting as we speak to look at the issue. My understanding is that the commencement of the administration of the vaccine to those aged over 85 in mid-February will go ahead. From speaking to many constituents, I know that GPs and their staff have been very active in putting together lists. However, things will definitely have to be configured. We will have to wait for details from the HSE, the task force and the vaccine roll-out teams. It does make things more difficult, because we all know that the Pfizer vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees. As Dr. Colm Reid said, it is a fussy vaccine and it is not as straightforward as the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>

          <from>Deputy Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I thank the Ministers of State for their presentations. It is an important area, because of the huge challenges posed by Covid. There is a huge problem in respect of the financial strain placed on everyone, especially those running small businesses and those who have lost their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">People who have lost their jobs are worried about support for their immediate family. It is hugely stressful for young people as well. The Covid pandemic has highlighted a number of key areas for attention, one of which is mental health. It is important that we have an overall review of services. The HSE website states that there has been a 490% increase in access requests to the website over a very short period of time. That increase highlights the extent of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I want to raise three issues with the Minister of State. The first was already raised by a colleague, namely, the need for a dedicated director for mental health reporting directly to the CEO of the HSE. Is that recommendation being looked at and is consideration being given to moving forward with an appointment?</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The second issue concerns the recommendation in A Vision for Change that a national mental health directorate be established. We need some clarification on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> Finally, a member of my immediate family was involved in a mental health facility where nine out of 27 people died in a very short period of time due to Covid. Part of the reason was that there were six residents per room. It was impossible to control the spread of Covid in that setting. An overall review was conducted into community hospitals and HSE nursing homes and there is now a detailed plan set out for refurbishment and upgrading those facilities. Can there be an overall review of all mental health facilities in the country with a view to setting out a clear plan for how and when they will be refurbished and brought up to the standard that is required? That is extremely important and the review should be started now. During a debate yesterday, we heard that more than €709 million was not spent by the Government. Now is the time to prioritise projects such as what I am proposing. The funding is there. Let us get on with planning and delivering it. Will the Minister of State indicate whether a review is in progress in respect of all mental health facilities and, if so, whether it will be presented to the House, through the health committee, in the not too distant future?</p>

          <p eId="para_70">I thank the Deputy for his questions. He is right that the programme for Government includes a commitment to examine the reappointment of a national director for mental health in the HSE. I will be engaging with the HSE on that in the next couple of weeks. I am very supportive of it. We spoke about the new Sharing the Vision policy. The national implementation and monitoring committee is in place and one of the key issues we will be looking at very shortly is a review of bed capacity throughout the whole country to see what the situation is.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> As the Deputy knows, the Mental Health Commission has oversight in regard to our mental health facilities. I met with the HSE yesterday to discuss our budget proposals, where we will be spending the money this year and making sure it is spent in parallel and in tandem with ongoing Covid efforts. There was €6 million allocated for the upgrading and refurbishment of a number of mental health facilities that were identified by the Mental Health Commission. I take on board the points the Deputy made in regard to mental health facilities throughout the country. I am delighted that the national implementation and monitoring committee is in place under the chairmanship of Mr. John Saunders. We have much work to do and a lot of issues to look at. The steering committees and sub-committees that will be put in place will hold the Department, the HSE, the Minister for Health and me to account. The issues the Deputy has raised are all issues that are to the forefront of my mind at this time. We will be looking at all of them. I thank the Deputy for his constructive approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">In the three and a half minutes available to me, I want to raise a number of issues with the Minister of State and give her time to respond. I will put my questions as distinctly as I can and I hope to get a response. Everybody is affected by what is happening at the moment and it is causing real challenges and difficulties for every section of society. Some are more impacted by it than others. Representatives of the Psychological Society of Ireland have told me that loneliness, isolation, anxiety, stress and the economic impacts of the pandemic are causing another hidden epidemic in mental health. We would all accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I want to focus on a couple of cohorts of people who need to be acknowledged when we talk about mental health and Covid. One of those groups is our front-line healthcare workers, who have gone through a hugely difficult and traumatic time. At this point in time, thousands of them are out sick. Some 7,000 healthcare workers contracted Covid-19 in the month of January alone. It is horrific. Sinn Féin has brought forward a Bill to protect those workers and make Covid-19 a notifiable occupational illness. Is that something the Government will support? We need to recognise the impacts of what is now being called long Covid, including its impact on people both physically and mentally. Is that an issue to which the Government is giving consideration?</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I have a very specific question regarding the vaccine roll-out and the news yesterday that the AstraZeneca vaccine will not be used for the over-70s. That is causing a lot of confusion and will slow down the roll-out of vaccinations for people in that age group. People want to know if they will be vaccinated and there is particular concern about those most at risk. People aged over 70 are among those most at risk. Is there a revised vaccination timetable? How can the Minister of State address the concerns of those aged over 70 who are listening to the news that the vaccine they were told would be the best for them and would allow them to get vaccinated more quickly will not now be used? What impact will that have on their mental health?</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I thank the Deputy for his questions. I agree with him wholeheartedly that loneliness, isolation and anxiety are a problem. People are really concerned at the moment and we have never seen such high levels of issues from the low impact of mental health challenges. The HSE's psychosocial framework is particularly focused on healthcare staff. That does not just include staff in the HSE sector; supports and counselling are available across all the sectors, including for those working in nursing homes. The Deputy referred to the number of healthcare staff who are off work on Covid leave. There are another 2,000 of them in nursing homes and 300 mental health staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The Deputy asked whether there will be a revised vaccination timetable. I am sure there will be but I do not know about it yet. The high-level task force is meeting today. All of this news broke yesterday and the only information I have is that the roll-out for over-85s, which was to commence mid-February, is still planned to go ahead. Obviously, it is going to be logistically way more difficult now because the AstraZeneca vaccine can be stored at room temperature whereas the BioNTech vaccine has to be stored at -70 °C. It will be more challenging but I am sure we will have a lot more detail in the next 48 hours.</p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_77">The pandemic is taking its toll on everyone's mental health. It is especially felt by people living alone, young people and people who have not been able to see their family members since last March. The key to addressing increased anxiety and isolation is an effective Covid elimination strategy for the island of Ireland, such as that proposed by the We Can be Zero campaign. We need immediate measures, a massive investment in public health resources, distribution of the vaccine, mandatory hotel-based quarantining for people landing on the island and significantly greater co-operation with Northern Ireland. This strategy would get us back to normal more quickly, give people hope and, therefore, help to address mental concerns. In addition, quicker decisions on issues like the leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations and better consultation with the people involved would help to ease stress and anxiety around those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the continuing underinvestment in our mental health services. There is an over-reliance on GPs and overstretched NGOs, a lack of multidisciplinary teams in settings where they are required the most and a continued practice of keeping people with psychiatric conditions in congregated settings. The recent report by the Mental Health Commission on mental health services for older people highlighted the inadequacy of services and the need for urgent improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I wish to raise three specific issues. Time is limited for the Minister of State to reply but I would appreciate written answers to questions she does not have time to address. First, staff in primary care mental health services, which were already overstretched before the pandemic, have been redeployed to other services. Resources have been taken away from the preventative and early intervention areas. Before Christmas, the Irish College of General Practitioners informed the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health that many of its members had stopped referring patients to primary care mental health services because of extensive waiting lists driven up even further by staff redeployments. As a result, the only option for many GPs is simply to prescribe medication, which is in no one's interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Demand for these services will only increase and people's conditions will become more complex and more expensive to treat. How does the Minister of State intend to address this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> A major concern I share with many is the inappropriate accommodation of people with disabilities in congregated settings. There are over 1,500 people with disabilities under 65 in nursing homes. Some psychiatric patients reside in institutions and there are many living in intellectual disability services. Therefore, despite the best efforts of all involved, Covid-19 spreads quickly in congregated settings. I understand that the Minister of State inherited this situation but she still has to respond to it now, and urgently. I wonder what steps have been taken to protect the people in question, including through the distribution of the vaccine to those under 70 in the congregated settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> The Minister of State mentioned eating disorders. We are aware that Covid-19 exacerbates existing mental health issues. It is very worrying, therefore, that no funding was allocated under the national eating disorder treatment plan for 2020 and that none of the €1.6 million allocated in 2019 was spent. Eating disorders, which disproportionately present among young women, are among the psychiatric conditions most associated with mortality. While the decisions made were HSE decisions, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could look into the matter personally and urgently and get back to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I thank the Deputy for raising these really significant issues. I will work backwards. On eating disorders, I have been really concerned that over the past three years, very little of the money designated has been spent. I had a meeting with HSE officials yesterday on this matter and on staffing issues in respect of eating disorders. Speaking off the cuff, I believe €4.7 million will be available to me this year. I guarantee the Deputy that all that money will be spent. I am very concerned about eating disorders. I have met the HSE clinical programme leaders and representatives of Bodywhys and I am very concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> On the roll-out of vaccines, I will give an update. The Mental Health Commission has reported that as of 28 January, last Thursday, with regard to 46 mental health facilities with residents aged 65 and over, staff in 31 and residents in 36 had received the vaccine. That was the position last week and the roll-out is continuing this week. I should have more up-to-date figures by the end of next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">We are in the middle of a virus pandemic and I am afraid there is a mental health pandemic waiting at the other side of it. Day after day, I am contacted by people in genuine trouble. This week, from 1 February to 7 February, is Children's Mental Health Week. Mental health issues have come to the fore for children and adults alike over the past year. The pandemic has taken a great toll on everyone's emotional well-being. Among children, including young children at home, and leaving certificate students, it has led to a lot of anxiety and fear. Doctors who have not seen children presenting before with mental health issues are seeing them more and more. They are worried about what comes next for these children. I have heard of cases of doctors from the children's hospital having referred patients to a local service only for it not to have followed up. In these times of increased anxiety and mental health issues among young people, what are we doing to resource services of the kind required in counties such as Carlow, where there are no child and adult mental health services to speak of?</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> While I am aware that the Minister of State is committed, we are behind on resources. Recently, a damning report by the Mental Health Commission found significant shortcomings in the HSE-led mental health rehabilitation services in Carlow. People with severe and enduring mental illness are some of the most vulnerable in our community. Rehabilitation provides them with an opportunity to recover and retain quality of life. The report made it clear that an opportunity was lost. We must not lose these opportunities. People dealing with mental health issues are the most vulnerable. They matter and we need to make sure they feel that.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I recently proposed that Carlow become a talking town, a place where anyone can access the help he or she needs at any time without stigma, judgment or obstacles. Can we consider rolling this out nationwide? It is so important. We need to treat mental health like physical health such that going to someone to talk is regarded as the same as going to the gym for a training session. There is no stigma attached to one so there should be no stigma attached to the other. There are supports available but we need to tie everything together and accord to mental health the priority it deserves. I know the Minister of State will do this so I ask her today whether we can establish a system whereby somebody in need of mental health support can just walk into his or her local shop displaying a logo and find the resources needed. This is so important. Information is the key in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I was going to ask about the vaccine and I am glad the Minister of State is giving the information. There is fear over access to the vaccine, particularly among the over-70s regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. I am aware that the Minister of State will have a plan in place so people can get the relevant information. It is crucial that they get it. Once they do, it will help. I thank the Minister of State.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I stand here before the Minister of State following a very useful and informative meeting she had in my constituency with representatives from the GAA, the HSE, Pieta House and SOSAD, and, of course, people affected by the loss of a loved one through suicide. I stand here before the Minister of State to reiterate the points I made at that meeting on the critical needs that arise. There has been a disproportionate increase in the number of young people taking their own lives or attempting to do so in my constituency. I firmly believe the resources that are required do not exist in my constituency. At the meeting, I had three specific asks. One was that the likes of Jigsaw should come to the constituency of Cavan–Monaghan. I am aware that the Minister of State is very much to the fore in supporting that idea but we need to see the HSE coming on board and making a commitment to the area because the service would provide early intervention. I am absolutely convinced the service is needed for young people in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Could the Minister of State commit today to the provision of suicide crisis assessment nurses, SCANs, for Cavan–Monaghan? I am aware from speaking to those working at the coalface, including HSE staff, general practitioners, nurses and others who are presented with the problems of people coming in to them, that SCANs would be instrumental in providing early intervention for young people when they find themselves in dark places.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I ask that primary care psychologist supports be put in place for young people across Cavan–Monaghan. I cannot reiterate enough the needs that arise. I have noted the dark places in which I have seen young people and the number of lives that have been lost. People as young as 16 have taken their own lives in my constituency. I do not need to tell the Minister of State the trauma and trail of destruction this leaves behind for family members and communities. People rally together but in these times it has been particularly difficult to support families in the way required. That is why Jigsaw is needed for Cavan–Monaghan. SCANs and primary care psychologist support are needed. The extra hours would be much appreciated.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">I thank the Minister of State for facilitating today's important debate on mental health. I recently received a copy of the HSE Psychosocial Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic. It is certainly a well-thought-out document. It identifies the needs of various segments of society and the proposed action points. It also highlights specific relationships that we can all develop to keep us well and to stay well. It provides an overview of the seriousness of the mental health impact that the pandemic has had on Irish society. The document highlights children and adolescents as comprising a priority group that requires particular consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> In my constituency, two organisations — Mindspace Mayo and Mayo Mental Health Association — provide significant support to people in a relatively wide range of age groups. Mindspace Mayo provides support to those between 15 and 25 and it has hubs in Castlebar and outreach services in Ballina and Erris. However, I am particularly concerned about the supports for people under 15 because there seems to be no organisation in Mayo catering for them specifically. They are experiencing extreme disruption in their daily lives. Normal supports, such as school and friends, are not available during the current restrictions. Jigsaw provides services to youths from 12 years of age but it is based in Galway and Roscommon. I would be grateful, therefore, if a dedicated service for youths between 12 and 15 could be established in Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">We have funded this year the additional staff required to develop the HSE psychosocial framework. The primary care list, which we all know is extremely long, is, as one Deputy said earlier, something I inherited but have been working on intensively. Currently, there are 12,000 under-18s on that list and 6,000 of them have been waiting over 12 months, which is not acceptable to me. I met with the HSE recently and with the primary care team. We are putting in place a 12-month approach to reduce the waiting list. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last week on the funding. I am hopeful that in the next three or four weeks, I will be able to bring forward a proposal that will significantly reduce that waiting list. People are quite right that GPs are putting children onto waiting lists. Some are going onto the CAMHS waiting list and some are going onto the primary care waiting list. When there is a child who needs these supports, people and parents cannot wait. As a parent, I understand that so I am working hard to devise a targeted approach to the waiting list, especially for those waiting over 12 months.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">Just a statement. I thank the Minister of State for her opening speech. I will tip on two issues. I am glad the Minister of State noted in her speech that the availability of staff is and has been an ongoing issue. She stated in her opening statement:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_99">While we do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and any subsequent demand on services, it is acknowledged that there have been increased presentations in certain areas, especially in first episode psychosis and eating disorders.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">I will quote from a column in <i>The Irish Times</i> in January as a means of pointing out how serious an issue this is. It relates to the challenge the Minister of State and her Department will face after Covid:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_101"> There's a 'tsunami of mental health need' coming when Covid-19 recedes. Ireland's mental health system is not prepared for a crisis - [Why?] Because it was in one before we ever heard of coronavirus.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">It continues by quoting Dr. Karen O'Connor, who is a psychiatrist and the national clinical lead for early intervention in psychosis:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_103">I don’t want to overstate it, but it’s based on the numbers that we’re getting out of our early intervention and psychosocial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">What she means by that is illustrated by a quote from a patient who took part in a survey mentioned in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>. I want to highlight this quote because it shows how service users are feeling at present. I think we will be in an even bigger crisis after we have come out of the Covid situation. According to this patient, as quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_105">I was convinced I was starting to have a psychotic episode and I did everything they tell you ...  [I contacted the HSE funded text service] 50808 who told me to contact the Caredoc or 999 ... I called 999 who told me to come into the hospital where my usual psychiatrist was on call. She proceeded to tell me I need to learn coping mechanisms ... and that they couldn’t do anything because I’m not suicidal and sent me home. Since then I’ve had nurses calling and doing the checklist shit with me every day or so, but they don't seem to have any plan to stop me feeling this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I could go through the figures of 10,000 and 20,000, but instead I will explain what I am really worried about. When I was brought up, my parents used to tell me not to worry about what would happen tomorrow but to plan how I would deal with it. Over recent months, I have been speaking to laypeople and people in various services who are genuinely terrified that when Covid is over, there will be knock-on effects on mortgage relief, marriage break-ups, family break-ups, damaged children and other effects across the board. We need to have a plan. We can work on all side of the House on this. I appeal to the Minister of State and her Department to start getting ready now for what will happen in 12 or 18 months' time, when this will be a serious tsunami. I noted a recent survey in the US which found that there has been a 42% increase in mental health issues and anxiety among those surveyed. We are no different from anybody else. We are a small country. We have been hit harder. It is time to prepare for the tsunami that is coming. Let us hope we will not be here in 12 months' time saying, "We hate to say we told you so, but we told you so." We do not want that. We want to work together to get a better mental health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">It is questions and answers. I have two specific questions. One relates to correspondence I have received in the last couple of weeks about the frustration of psychiatric nurses concerning the roll-out of the vaccine, particularly for those in acute mental health services. There is no timeline and there is complete frustration for psychiatric nurses in that setting. Will the Minister of State give reassurance or a timeline for psychiatric nurses in the mental health services getting the vaccine?</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> The second question, which other Deputies have touched on, relates to the effects of the pandemic on children. We all have mechanisms or coping exercises to deal with this pandemic and we are all different. Regardless of one's identity, we all have a sense of anxiety in relation to what has happened and what will come. This has a particularly detrimental effect on children because of the lack of school, everyday routines and so forth. What new resources will the Minister of State put into CAMHS in the short and medium term?</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I thank the Deputy for his two questions. On the vaccine, I met with the executive mental health clinical directors on Tuesday afternoon and we discussed at length the situation relating to the vaccine. Public health nurses and those working for mental health services will come under cohort 2. Some 70,000 of those staff have been vaccinated and the roll-out will continue in the next couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> On CAMHS, which is close to my heart, I met yesterday with the HSE in relation to the €23 million I secured in the budget. There will be 29 extra child and adolescent mental health staff put in place. The waiting list is currently at around 2,500 and I am anxious that it be reduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I want to put on the record my serious concern about the impact of the leaving certificate crisis on the mental health of the nation's 17- and 18-year-olds. The leaving cert is stressful in normal times, which is one of the reasons I am in favour of the abolition of the exam. We are told that 50% of teens normally feel nervous when they think about exams and 25% feel physically unwell. However, with Covid, things move into a higher gear altogether. Some students have experienced Covid directly. Students have had family members with the disease. Students have relatives who have died. Students live with family members who have underlying conditions and can be terrified of bringing the disease home. Students have lost 15 weeks of classroom teaching time already. There are some students out there who cannot sleep. There are others who are not eating properly, as well as some who are crying, who cannot get out of bed and who have gone on medication to get them through the exams. Not all students show these symptoms, perhaps not a majority, but all are feeling the strain.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> No doubt the Minister of State will tell me the Government will make a decision next Tuesday and that this should relieve much of the stress. However, I say the Government's decision must relieve the stress and not add to it. I am fearful that the Government is close to making a decision which does add to the stress. A late summer leaving cert means that exam stress goes on for an extra four to six weeks and that the students who need to work for the summer to make money to go to college cannot do so. A hybrid leaving cert risks being the worst of both worlds. Students can end up with the stress of a written exam and the stress of handing in papers that go towards calculated grades. That creates two hurdles and potentially twice as much pressure. The best solution by far is to cancel the exams, give every student a cert and invest in third level to the point where open access can be provided next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Will the Government support the commissioning of a National Educational Psychological Service survey to assess the mental health of the nation's 61,000 leaving certificate students?</p>

          <p eId="para_116">The report of the expert group set up to review the Mental Health Act 2001 was published in 2015. It contains 165 recommendations, including provisions intended to strengthen protections for people who are detained without consent at approved centres. In June 2016, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy McEntee, stated that the draft legislation would be completed by the end of that year. In July 2019, a draft heads of Bill was sent to the Mental Health Commission for its consideration, with a six-month turnaround. In the past few months, responses to parliamentary questions from some of my Dáil colleagues indicated that the Department was preparing a final draft of the heads of the Bill on a part-by-part basis, with a view to finalising the draft Bill by the end of 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> By any metric, that is a very unsatisfactory timeline for the development of legislation that is so badly needed. Given that the delays date back more than five years, we cannot lay this at the door of Covid-19. The Minister of State said we will receive the Bill soon. Numerous dates have been given for publication of the draft legislation and none of them has been met. These delays are highly problematic given the lengthy duration to date of the review of the Act and the seriousness of the gaps in human rights protections for adults and children receiving inpatient mental health treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> In 2018, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill was successfully put before the House, but the Act has never been commenced. As the mental health community waits for the fully revised mental health legislation to be produced, and we have waited for more than five years, will the Department and the Minister of State consider commencing at least some limited aspects of the 2018 Act? For example, there is currently no definition in our mental health services of what constitutes a voluntary patient. This has created a grey area whereby a person's right to reviews and tribunals is not clearly set out in law, leaving vulnerable people even more so in a system that is still underfunded and lacking in supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Could we have a timeline for the development of the fully revised Mental Health Act? Can we get a certain date for the completion of the revision of the 2001 Act, even if that date is slightly further away than we would like? Will the Department and the Minister of State consider commencing some limited sections of the 2018 Act in the meantime?</p>

          <p eId="para_120">There is no doubt that the pandemic has been difficult for everyone's mental resilience and mental fitness, but two groups find it even more difficult than most. When one's toolbox is full, one will find it easier to respond to a global pandemic, whereas when one has challenges and when there are complexities in one's life, it is inevitable that one will suffer more. The two groups I have in mind are dealt with in my area by the Finglas Counselling Service and the Finglas addiction support team. I imagine that the Finglas Counselling Service is the same as many community-based counselling services throughout the country. It provides an excellent service and responds to the service failure by the HSE to provide much-needed counselling, often at an entry level to issues that can be resolved easily within counselling before more profound mental health difficulties can develop. What can we do to support such community-based counselling services?</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> The other group I wish to raise is supported by the Finglas addiction support team. The Minister of State will be aware that I have spoken many times about the issue of dual diagnosis. Dr. Amir Niazi, the clinical lead in this area, stated to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last year that he looked forward to bringing forward a report that would deal with the four recommendations in the Finglas addiction support team's report, namely, re-establishing a clinical governance programme, amending the Mental Health Act to provide that there is no such thing as a wrong door for people with either an addiction or a mental health problem, and providing education for professionals in both services in order that the two issues could be linked.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">Covid has visited significant pressures on mental health services. For all of us, isolation and restrictions have been a considerable challenge, but for those battling their way through life, it has been nothing short of a nightmare. In August, I first spoke in the House about the following young constituent. His family desperately wanted to get him out of seclusion, but at the time, St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar was not in a position to manage that process. Months passed and this man spent 110 days in isolation, more than half the time he has spent in the care of mental health services since he was admitted in July. His family have fought desperately for help, and at a family conference with his medical team in November, it was agreed that two care centres would be approached in the hope they could provide the intensive rehabilitative care that this young man realises is necessary if he is to return to the community. He himself craved the move and wrote to the Minister of State to ask that the process be sped up. On behalf of the family, I acknowledge her support and that of her staff for the family and for their fears and concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> Christmas for this young man and his family was a nightmare. On one side of a window in St. Loman's Hospital, his mother desperately hoped she would never see another Christmas like it. As the days turned into weeks and months, the young man grew ever more frustrated and, unfortunately, last Friday he lashed out at a fellow patient and was returned to isolation. Needless to say, his family are crestfallen, fearing that the prospect of a possible recovery has been all but quashed. The promise of that intensive rehab lies in the balance, as is the promise of a life and of a future. Thankfully, he was released from isolation last night but he is heavily sedated and medicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> This is just one young man caught on the mental health treadmill, a seemingly never-ending cycle of uncertainty and bleakness that, unfortunately, has been fuelled by Covid. For this young man and his family, I plead with the HSE to get him the care he so desperately needs. I ask it not to leave him to languish within the walls of the system and not to turn out the lights on this young life, and to deliver him the intensive rehabilitative care he so desperately needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I will try to answer as many of the questions as possible. The national clinical programme for dual diagnosis is proceeding and the new clinical lead is in place. I have funded new posts for dual diagnosis in 2021, which I know everybody will welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> On the issues relating to the Mental Health Act 2001, this is extremely complex legislation and a great deal of work is being undertaken. I have discussed it with the Attorney General and we will move on it soon. It is not feasible to bring forward certain sections before others. In any event, we are almost at the point of being able to publish the heads of the Bill and I hope it will get the support of the House in due course.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I addressed that question earlier, although the Deputy might not have been in the Chamber. I will meet representatives of the HSE in the coming weeks. My primary focus when I came into the job was to get the national implementation and monitoring committee in place for Sharing the Vision. Given that we were dealing with the Covid pandemic, I wanted to ensure that services could be retained insofar as was possible. Between 85% and 90% of all services are ongoing and it is important to put that on record. I will meet representatives of the HSE soon. As I said earlier, I am supportive of that role being created in the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">On a separate front, yet another crisis is descending into a state of emergency. A complete lack of concern has been shown by the Government since the start of the pandemic towards those held at direct provision sites. Does the mental health of these men, women and children even register in the thought process of the Government? What provision and supports has the Government put in place for those at direct provision sites who are struggling with their mental health?</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I thank the Deputy for that very important question. The HSE has worked closely with different NGOs to provide counselling supports. MyMind, for example, has provided 10,000 instances of counselling supports in 15 different languages for people living in Ireland and this supports people who live in direct provision.</p>

With the suspension of sport under different levels of Covid-19 restrictions, the support sport gives to the mental health of so many has vanished overnight. What was a mental health crisis pre-Covid is now a mental health emergency. What provisions are being put in place for the many across the sporting community who have watched as the most basic of mental health supports have vanished? What supports have the Minister of State and his Department sought to put in place for participants through organisations such as Sport Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_132">We have put €7 million in support of the delivery of a range of actions and we have worked with all the stakeholders. Effectively, we are asking people to keep active and go outdoors. Even during the winter, physical activity can be very helpful. Indeed, as I was listening to the radio in Limerick when coming to Dublin today, it was great to hear that local GAA clubs have opened up their grounds so people can walk around. We are working with all the various stakeholders and organisations because isolation is a significant risk for people of all ages during the Covid-19 pandemic. I pay tribute to all the sporting organisations, and this Government is committed to working with them to try to address these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I will ask questions but the answers may be given in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Today, I want to start by wishing a very special young boy named Gavin from County Wexford a happy 18th birthday. I hope that he, his dad, two brothers and sister have a lovely celebration, not just because it is his 18 birthday but because he almost did not make it as he has mental health problems. I congratulate his dad and family, who have assisted Gavin in every way possible for the last number of years. I must mention the staff in the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Arden House in Wexford, who have been Gavin's saving grace.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I want to inform the Minister of State, however, that as Gavin turns 18 today, he moves from the CAMHS to the adult mental health service. It is daunting and it is unclear for him and his family what that involves. I will be there to help, however. I hope the Minister of State will also assist in that transition to ensure he gets the help he requires to see his 80th birthday, because it was not there for him as a minor in the way it should have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The staff in CAMHS in Arden House, Wexford have been fantastic but they are under pressure. They are understaffed with no child psychologist and no dietitian. According to a Mental Health Reform document received yesterday by every Deputy in this House, the country has 2,000 children on mental health waiting lists. Many of them are in County Wexford. I have asked continually, every time I stand on the floor of this House, for this to be resolved. We need to provide a full staffing team for CAMHS in County Wexford with added availability for an out-of-hours service. It is a matter of life or death.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Worryingly, as I said, yesterday I received an update from Mental Health Reform and what it contains is frightening. The report says the HSE has seen an increase of 490%; that is more than 800,000 people contacting the mental health website. That is one in six people in this country, and yet only 6% of our health budget goes towards mental health services. There is no vaccine for mental health. There are, however, many voluntary organisations, which are critical to the care and management of mental health sufferers, that are now devoid of funding because of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> Will the Minister of State update us on the staffing of CAMHS at Arden House? What is the Government's proposal to assist the many voluntary organisations with funding? Will the Minister of State be able to tell me when public health nurses in the mental health sector will be vaccinated? That can be provided in writing. I thank the Minister of State.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I do not have a question but I have some comments. One year ago, we had no idea that our world was about to be turned upside down. If we had seen Covid-19 coming, I like to think we would have been prepared. Sadly, a crisis seldom gives fair warning. Another crisis is looming and making its presence felt more and more each day, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The people of this country, young and old, have moved towards a mental health crisis. That crisis has arrived and it is obvious that we are not prepared for it. This lockdown has hit people much harder. Every age group is finding it harder to cope. There has been an immense slump in the mood throughout the country. We see alarming numbers of daily deaths, new cases, new mutations of the Covid-19 virus, confusion and dismay surrounding the vaccine roll-out, and long, dark and dismal winter evenings. These issues, in addition to the upheaval that restrictions bring to their lives plus the idea that there is no certain end in sight, have proven too much for many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> It is not just that people have lost their fight, that optimism has deserted them or that they are simply worn down by the life we are now forced to live. It is more than that. People are suffering from what is referred to by psychologists as reactive or situational depression. It is very real. Its most common triggers are bereavement, isolation, health worries, financial concerns, loss of independence or control, and restrictions or limitations that impact normal routines.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> We hear the mental health statistics regularly. There has been a 30% increase in prescribed medications and helplines are overwhelmed with desperate callers. We seldom hear the human stories behind these cries for help during this pandemic, such as the woman who has lain in a hospital bed for two months without any visitors, the man who has been inside his home alone since Christmas with only a knock on the door to tell him his shopping has arrived, the family who cannot afford a computer for their child to access schoolwork, the teenager who spends all day, every day, online with no human contact, the family that has lost three members to Covid-19, the woman who is afraid to go shopping in case she touches someone who could infect her, and the elderly lady who cries every day as she is so afraid of becoming ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> There are endless stories and endless suffering. People will continue to suffer long after the pandemic is over. Many will not bounce back to normal life just because this virus is suppressed. Taking off our masks will not be enough to make people smile again. It will take time and it will take help. We know this now; we can see it coming. We must prepare for what is yet to come. There is no excuse for us to be taken by surprise this time. We must invest in our mental health services, particularly our community services. Now is the time to build the human resource capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community. We owe this to people everywhere. We need to address their suffering. They need intervention, help and support. We urgently require a focused approach and a co-ordinated plan that is properly resourced and funded so those who reach out for help can be assisted to overcome the burden of mental health pressure.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I thank the Ministers of State for the opportunity to speak. As always, my worry is not the commitment of the Ministers of State to their job. I know personally that they are focused on the issue of mental health. The difficulty is that consecutive governments, certainly in my political career, have paid lip service to the issue of mental health when it came to resourcing. We had A Vision for Change that we all rallied around and in its entire lifetime we managed to implement approximately 40% of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">It is one of those popular subjects that all Deputies, county councillors, Senators and whoever else like to be associated with and say a few words on but once the debate is over that is the end of it. Within the HSE and the Department of Health, the first budget to be raided to facilitate some other aspect is always the mental health budget. I feel for the Minister of State in that respect because she has to fight hard to get whatever she manages to get.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> I have lived experience of mental health complaints, as many of us will have but in recent months since Covid-19 has been around, the word "tsunami" has been mentioned and I have used it myself. Whether we are suppressing the figures - I am not accusing the Minister of State of doing that - or whether the news cycle is just so focused on Covid-19, we are not even touching the iceberg. I will tell one story that is accurate and that can be got from the archives of Ocean FM. The person in charge of Sligo town cemetery was giving an analogy on 8 September in which he was discussing, at that stage, deaths from Covid-19 that he had to cater for in the cemetery compared with other matters. I know we are in a much different place today but up to that point he had buried one person due to Covid-19 and ten people due to suicide since the previous March. I am sure Sligo is not unique in those sorts of figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I am not trying in any way to reduce or dilute the gravity of the Covid-19 situation or of all of the fatalities and the people who we have lost but people's mental health has come second. In the National Rehabilitation Hospital, admissions through incidences of attempted suicide were 17% compared with 1% during the same period in the previous year. In speaking to young people, including 16 year olds through to students in college, the words I am hearing are "despair", "frustration", "depression" and "anger". They have a sense of having lost their rights of passage on so many things, whether it was a summer job, a J1 visa to the United States, the driving test or so many others. I mention elderly people and Age Action is reporting that up to 40% of those presenting to the mental health services for the first time are elderly people. We feel it ourselves and we are the lucky ones who are able to go to the Dáil every week and to our offices and we are busy on our phones trying to help constituents. What about the 16 year old who has not been out since many months ago or the 82 year old who cannot go and visit friends or family?</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The Minister of State will know I have been critical of our approach to the entire Covid-19 process in terms of the lack of a strategy. We need a strategy on mental health from now on as we emerge from this process. Hopefully we will get vaccines right because there is a tsunami. It is already out there but nobody is talking about it. I know the Minister of State is aware of it but I suspect, like all of her predecessors in my political career, she is getting the runaround and the lip service to say that it is an important issue and it will be dealt with. The Minister of State should fight harder and make sure there is an appropriate strategy in place for the tsunami and emergency we are already in.</p>

          <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to hear statements on the important issue of mental health. Covid-19 has posed fundamental challenges for people's mental health, as many individuals have experienced heightened stress, anxiety, fear or panic. We have come through a dark and dreary winter and we must be proactive to help people through these difficult times. The Covid-19 pandemic and its restrictions have been challenging for people in our society. People are social by nature and restrictions that reduced human contact have been particularly difficult. People miss their communities, friends and extended families dearly. Talking about our mental health and monitoring the mood of the public is essential. It is OK not to feel OK during this period. This time is difficult, but we will get through this.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> As part of the response to these challenges, the Government has provided guidance and support for people to manage both their physical and mental well-being and to stay connected. Significant funds have been allocated to the Keep Well campaign, with €7 million being provided to support the delivery of a range of actions and support services, which will be rolled out over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Isolation of people of all ages is a significant risk during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly during periods of tight restrictions on movement and social interactions. The Community Call programme was introduced in mid-2020 to provide local helplines through local authorities for practical supports, information sharing and befriending. This has been exceptionally successful in my view from speaking to people who have interacted with these platforms. Working with partner organisations, including An Garda Síochána, NGOs and Volunteer Ireland, there is a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting those most at risk of isolation. I want to make the message clear; those feeling isolated are not alone in this and people are here to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> I would also like to highlight again the use of social bubbles. People in certain categories can form a support bubble with one other household. Those who can form a support bubble include those alone with children under the age of 18, those living alone, those sharing parenting or custody arrangements, those living with an adult to whom they provide care and those who live alone and have a carer or carers who support them. These times are difficult for everyone; there is no doubt about that. We need to try to do our best and get through this. I encourage people to look out for those who are isolated in our communities, to stay connected with those in their community and not to be too hard on themselves, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> We have to accept the fact that recent months have been extraordinarily difficult for everybody. Nobody has had an easy ride during this pandemic. It has been quite a challenge and as the youngest Member of Dáil Éireann, I have to say that a lot of young people are suffering out there. We are quite conscious of that and unfortunately, it will be some time yet before we will be back to some degree of normality. I insist that the Government would continue to monitor the national mood for people who have never experienced any mental health difficulties and who are now feeling isolated and lonely. From interaction with people in my age group who were supposed to be going out into the world and starting their lives as young professionals after finishing up college education, many of those are reporting to me that they are feeling lonely and isolated. We have to show considerable focus in that particular area.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I wish the Minister of State well in her Department. I know she is doing a lot of significant and good work and I thank her.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">I thank the Minister of State for being here to reply to the debate. The area of mental health services has traditionally been neglected. That has been acknowledged over the last 20 years, particularly since the decongregation of the mental institutions. That was a good thing in itself but alternatives had to be put in place and were not put in place. They need to be put in place now as a matter of serious urgency. In particular, there is a need for access for children, adolescents and adults to emergency treatment and they must be able to access it easily and readily. It is not there at present and countless situations have developed whereby their families have had to try to provide facilities themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> The question of eating disorders among young girls has been mentioned already. It is a pressing situation which needs a response that will reach out to them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> I refer to those who have addictions. There is no place for them to go and they will not be taken into a residential facility if they have an addiction and vice versa. There is an issue that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and I hope that the Minister of State will be able to deal with that. I thank the Acting Chairman for facilitating me.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I commend the Minister of State for all of her work so far. She is doing great work and it is greatly appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Mental health is an issue that I and my rural colleagues raised in our Private Members' motion in December, when we noted that Covid-19 was having a huge impact on people. We know that mental health is a serious issue in this State, without ever looking at any pandemic and the effects that is having. We have always grappled with getting to grips with mental health. We also know that a significant amount of work needs to be done to address the mental health fallout for students at primary and second level. I know there is a lot of uncertainty among leaving certificate students and I worry for them. I have mentioned this to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, in a briefing we had and I hope that some certainty will be given to those students as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Last week, I submitted a parliamentary question asking the Minister for Education if the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, is sufficiently resourced and what plans were in place to recruit staff to NEPS to deal with the increase in psychological distress being caused to students as a result of Covid-19-related restrictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I welcome the fact that in her reply, the Minister of State confirmed that NEPS is providing student services aimed at managing stress, anxiety and panic attacks and that the number of sanctioned NEPS psychologists currently stands at 221, which includes an additional 17 psychological posts to support the well-being of school communities, but there is much more needed here. We have a tsunami coming at us and it affects people of all ages. We need to be prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> While progress in this area is welcome, it is alarming that the share of health funding being allocated to mental health in recent years has ranged from 5.7% to 6.3%. While, in 2019, it was 6.3%, it will fall dramatically to 5.2% in 2021. I ask for that to be looked at because there is an expected significant rise in demand for supports and services in the wake of this pandemic.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">Like Deputy Nolan, I wish the Minister of State well in her work in this vital and important area. I will ask the Minister of State a number of questions. Deputy Butler will not have time to reply but she might write to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The first is about the current stage of the Crisis House in Clonmel, a commencement date for that house and where it is at, and also about the Jigsaw roll-out in Tipperary. Is the headquarters of the latter in Thurles procured and is it being fitted out and ready to start? When will we have a start date? How many outreach hubs will we have in towns such as Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town in the south of the county and, indeed, Killenaule and Ballingarry and up into Nenagh and the rural area up in Roscrea as well? It was never more badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Members are talking about a tsunami coming down the line. We are in the tsunami. It is here. We are immersed in it, from the cradle to the grave but really among young people of school age, particularly secondary school, those doing the leaving certificate this year who were in fifth year last year and students going back to college or trying to go back or trying to start next year. There are huge issues. There is huge angst. They cannot do what they normally do. Young people need to live their lives and they cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The older people are locked away cocooning and the relentless news and figures from RTÉ is frightening. Deputy MacSharry's figures were telling. That is happening everywhere. We have far more people dying by their own hands, sadly, in suicide, than have died that I know of with the virus. Where anybody dies with the virus or gets seriously ill - I had a constituent on to me this morning - it is a horrible situation. The family cannot grieve properly and they cannot have a proper funeral or send-off, or be with their loved ones. It is awful, but we must look at the knock-on consequences with people with mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I salute Ms Trudi Lalor, a Laois girl now living in Tipperary. A renowned singer, Ms Lalor has a new scheme for country music, Reaching Out, where she is getting loved artists connected with patrons of theirs who really like them. It has been a great success. I thank Tipp FM as well for supporting it. It is a case of anything we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> I support Community Suicide Awareness Workers, C-SAW, in Clonmel, and Mr. Joe Leahy and Ms May Walsh there, and others, and the volunteers and the work they do. I was disappointed last week to read about the high salaries of the chief executives in charitable companies. That is not where we want to be. We all go out and support those walks etc. such as Darkness into Light, but when I see this, it is not necessary. Greed is everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> What we want now is help and support for our people as a nation. We need to have more funding put into mental health. Our spending is only at 5% and 6% where other European countries are at 12%. Yesterday a €400 million budget that we did not spend last year was allowed be held onto this year. It is shocking to see the neglect in mental health and people cannot spend the money that is needed.</p>

We have the Mental Health Reform submission, which I am sure the Minister of State is aware of and which was already referred to, we have the Ombudsman commission's report in relation to it and we have, quite extraordinarily, many articles in the national and daily newspapers telling us the situation in relation to mental health. The article that left an impression on me was by a therapist who has been working for a number of years, who said, "We must confront painful truth: we are facing into a mental health crisis." and, "I have never known my work [and myself to be] so ineffective." I will not name her. She was in the national newspapers. That was also carried in an article by Mr. Patrick Freyne.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Let me go to what matters. We have any amount of documents. In 1984, in a different life, I was very familiar with it. I foolishly was hopeful, when the Planning for the Future report was published and I worked as a psychologist, that we were moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, it was never implemented. That was followed by A Vision for Change. That was very badly partly implemented. We did not need another document. Then we had an update of literature and then, finally, we got Sharing the Vision. What we have really got is a constant change of language and no implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The Ombudsman's report is frightening in relation to mental health. The Ombudsman points out that we have the fourth highest suicide rate for teenagers in the EU-OECD region, 2,300 children waiting for an appointment to CAMHS, and all of the other figures that have been mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I have one minute left. I do not wish to quote figures. They are at pandemic levels but what is awfully important here is the independent monitoring commission. The Minister of State has made progress and I have taken the trouble of reading the minutes. First, I congratulate the Minister of State on pushing to set up that independent body. I do not wish to be negative but I have to say I worry about its independence. I worry about the gender breakdown. I worry that the health executive is very much represented on it. How will it function as an independent monitoring commission? Also, the chair of the Mental Health Commission, which has done tremendous work for mental health when it visits, is on it. There are serious questions here about independence and about the ability of that body to monitor implementation of the third document we have got, Sharing the Vision. I wish I could go on but I will not.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">I addressed the Minister of State at the time the second lockdown was being announced stating that we needed to have comprehensive data on self-harm presentations and on suicide in Ireland before there was ever another lockdown considered. We do not, as it happens, have either. That is an insult to Dáil but it is also an insult to the victims of mental health problems of whom there are many. Do we know yet how many suicides there were last year in Ireland? We do not have that figure. I will not go on about it because I have spoken about it previously. Nothing has happened or, at least, nothing visibly has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I appreciate that the Minister of State is working hard behind the scenes to advance the issue that she is responsible for - I want to make that clear - but all of us are working and living in an incredibly oppressive society at present. The feeling is entirely oppressive and it is largely driven by elements in the media. I questioned whether there was sufficient coverage of mental health and I was attacked by some public health doctors for doing that and told that, of course, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is trained to take account of mental health data. I asked how can it take account of it if it is not there and a media outlet, instead of probing whether the data were there or not, ran, in what I would consider to be an attempt to discredit my probing of it, a line stating that the chief medical officer, CMO, stated that NPHET regularly takes account of mental health. However, if you look at the minutes of NPHET, no account was taken of mental health up to the time of that second lockdown. One sub-committee mentioned it but there was no mention otherwise. The HSE national clinical programme for awareness and management of patients presenting with self-harm came out and stated that I was wrong to say that there was not data and that it had data from every emergency department. When one looks for the data, one finds out that they have data from some emergency departments but no data from any of the children's hospitals. We know children are suffering and we know that there are emergency departments so that is a lie on behalf of a Government agency to discredit somebody who is probing stuff. That is not good. That is oppressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> We have another arm of the Government practically going out to Dublin Airport to burn witches live on air. I am talking about RTÉ. It is a disgrace. It is oppressive. It is driving anxiety in the State what RTÉ is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> There are massive problems with free media in Ireland. <i>The Irish Times</i> had its hands out looking for money from the Government. God knows, it is entitled to it. It has been doing the Government's bidding for a year. Where is the free media to come from if the primary income source for media - I am not talking about all media - is the Department of Health and the Government? Of course, they are doing the Government's bidding. Of course, they are driving a narrative.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">On what is World Cancer Day, I extend my solidarity to Ms Lynsey Bennett and express my deep anger at what we saw yesterday - another woman and family failed by the State, another woman who was forced to go to the courts despite assurances that such would never happen again. It is a scandal. The Tánaiste gave a commitment to these women in 2018 and it is time that it was delivered upon. My thoughts are with Ms Bennett and her family today.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> D'fhógair an Rialtas inné nach mbeidh an vacsaín AstraZeneca á húsáid orthu sin atá thar 70 bliain d'aois. Cruthaíonn an bhacainn seo dúshlán mór don Rialtas ó thaobh an phlean chun vacasíní a chur ar fáil don phobal. Tá an cuma ar an scéal anois nach bhfuil plean mar is ceart ag an Rialtas maidir le vacsaín a thabhairt dóibh atá thar 70 bliain d'aois. Níl amlíne ar bith ann agus níl a fhios ag dóibh siúd sa phobal atá thar 70 bliain cén uair a bheidh siad ag fáil na vacsaíne nó cén dóigh. Beidh siad ag brath ar dhochtúirí teaghlaigh ach ní bheidh cumas stórála ag cuid mhór dochtúirí teaghlaigh leis an vacsaín a chur i bhfeidhm gan AstraZeneca. An bhfuil ról ag na cógaiseoirí ina leith sin? Tá soiléiriú agus freagraí de dhíth ar an phobal.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Yesterday, it was announced that the Government had taken the decision that the AstraZeneca vaccine would not be used to vaccinate those over 70 years of age. This vaccine was repeatedly described as a game changer and we all hoped that it would be, but yesterday's development presents major challenges for the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines throughout the State, not least because this vaccine is far easier to store and the need to roll out other vaccines to over-70s will present major logistical challenges for GPs, who are expected to roll out the vaccination programme in the community. The Taoiseach acknowledged as much yesterday when he stated that it would mean a change in the operation of the plan and would be a significant logistical challenge. However, the Tánaiste stated that it should not delay the roll-out. I find it difficult to believe how it cannot delay the roll-out in respect of over-70s. Timelines and targets were already thrown out the window with the reduced number of AstraZeneca vaccines coming to the State, and now there seems to be no sense of a plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> What is proposed in respect of the roll-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine? Who will get it? When will they get it? What is the situation facing over-70s? When will they be vaccinated? What is the new ambition in that regard? We do not know how long it will take to vaccinate over-70s without the AstraZeneca vaccine. There is no sense of a new strategy or timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> People are asking questions. For example, can GPs still be to the fore in administering vaccines that are deemed suitable for over-70s, given the major logistical challenges posed by how those vaccines are stored? Many GPs do not have suitable storage systems. Where will the vaccines be administered? Questions remain for pharmacies. When will pharmacists and their staff be vaccinated, when will they be part of the roll-out and what part will they play?</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> These are genuine questions that people like my mum, who falls into this category, want answered. They are alarmed at the news and want to be assured that the Government has a plan and what it will mean. They saw the advertisements placed in national media saying that GPs would be in contact with them over the next number of days, but now they are questioning what the plan is. Since the news emerged yesterday, there has been no clarity about how the situation will be managed. When will we see the revised targets and when will we have clarity? Will the Tánaiste answer some of the questions on capacity and the logistics involved in rolling the programme out through GPs? What will be the role of pharmacies? When will over-70s be vaccinated as a result of the Government's decision yesterday?</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_61" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_194">It is important to say that the nation's vaccination programme is well under way. More than 200,000 vaccines have been given. Compared with our peer European countries, we are among the top countries in the EU in terms of getting the vaccines out to people once we have received them. By last Sunday, we had received 207,000 doses, 200,000 of which had been given. The only constraints at the moment are factors that are not in our control - first, supply from the companies and, second, approvals by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> We have faced setbacks in the past week. We now know that AstraZeneca will provide us with 200,000 fewer doses in February and March than we had anticipated and our public health and scientific advisers have recommended that over-70s be given an mRNA vaccine - the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine - rather than the AstraZeneca vaccine. I should say that all three vaccines are safe and effective, particularly in terms of reducing hospitalisations and deaths, and they have been licensed for all age groups. However, because of the lack of detail and the relatively small number of older people involved in the AstraZeneca study, the recommendation for now - this will probably change - is to give the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to over-70s where possible. This means that the same number of vaccines will be given over the next couple of weeks as had been intended, but there will need to be some changes as to which groups are vaccinated and in what order. It means that we will still be able to start the vaccination programme for the over-85s in the middle of this month as planned, but they will get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine rather than the AstraZeneca vaccine. For over-70s, the roll-out may be slower, but it will be faster for healthcare workers and other groups. In total, however, the same number of people will be vaccinated.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> GPs can give the mRNA vaccines - the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine - but there are logistical challenges to that. They have to be kept at a very low temperature and can then be kept for up to five days at a moderate temperature of between 2°C and 8°C. It is possible for GPs to be the lead players, as it were, in the vaccination programme in respect of over-85s, but it might not be possible to administer vaccines in all surgeries. It may require vaccination centres and particular practices with the necessary infrastructure, but it can be done. GPs are willing to take part, want to be a part of it and believe they can do it. We believe they can do it, too.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> As will be the case elsewhere for the next couple of months, we will have to adapt our plans as the situation develops, supplies come in, the science changes and recommendations change, and we will do that. At least 1.2 million doses will still be delivered and given to people by the end of March, but there will need to be changes to the schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> My understanding is that pharmacists are part of group 2. They are considered to be healthcare workers who are patient facing. They will be vaccinated starting this month, most likely with the AstraZeneca vaccine for reasons the Deputy will understand.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Tánaiste for his answers. I ask him in his supplementary reply to address the other point I made to him, which was that in May 2018, when he was Taoiseach, he gave a commitment that no woman would be forced to go to court to seek compensation due to the failures associated with the CervicalCheck scandal. We know that promise has been broken time and time again and it needs to come to an end. No woman should be forced to go to court to seek justice and still not even have an apology from the State or the HSE. I ask the Tánaiste to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The Tánaiste said the vaccine roll-out will be slower for those aged over 70. Will he give an indication of what the timeframe is and when those aged over 70, which is the group that is most at risk, will be vaccinated? The original date was the end of March. What is the new date? Does the Tánaiste have any information on the number of GP surgeries that have the ability to vaccinate using the other two vaccines that have to be stored at lower temperatures of up to -20°C, as he has acknowledged? Will the pharmacists now be involved in the rolling out of the vaccination programme? How will they be able to take part in it?</p>

          <p eId="para_203">I thank the Deputy. I am advised that the vaccination of those aged over 85 will begin in the middle of February as planned but because we will have to use the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, of which there is less supply, as opposed to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the roll-out will be slower. I cannot give the Deputy exact timeframes and dates on it at this stage. It will allow us to speed up the vaccine programme for healthcare workers and high-risk people who are under 70. A lot of the details of this have to be worked out. This new development only happened in recent days with regard to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those aged over 70. We will have that detail and share it with people as soon as we have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> In relation to Lynsey Bennett, my thoughts are with her today also, and with her daughters Zoe and Haley. I do not want to comment too much on an individual case because I do not know the details of the case. I imagine the Deputy does not know either. It is the objective of the State and the Government to settle all cases by mediation where possible. I understand this case was settled by mediation and did not have to go to trial but perhaps it could have been settled earlier. Only the legal teams know that. At the time I made the commitment, as I have explained before, I believed and hoped it would be possible to settle all cases by mediation or negotiation but, unfortunately, that has not proved possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle need not worry. I will give the Tánaiste another go on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The Tánaiste's use of language was a bit unfortunate. This is not a confrontational issue and I think he misspoke when he used the word "trial". They certainly are not trials. My heart dropped, as, I think, did that of everybody in the nation who watched the video of Lynsey outside the court. It was another woman failed by the State over the misreading of her slides. She is 32 years of age. She is fighting for her daughters Zoe and Haley. I have a number of questions and I have put solutions to the Government. Why is she being dragged through the High Court fighting when she should be spending time with Zoe and Haley? Negligence was found here. Why is the Government and, dare I say it, the previous Government continuing to treat women like this? Why, three years after the Tánaiste stated on the "Six One News", which I remember watching live, that women would not have to go through courts are there an estimated 200 more cases lined up?</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> It is two months since poor Patricia Carrick, may she rest in peace, passed away. I remember the Taoiseach offered yet another apology. Her family had to go into the courts after she passed away to instruct on her payment and get €2.75 million. The landmark Morrissey judgment was appealed by the State. It should never have been appealed and I, and possibly one or two others in the House, opposed but no other party did so. The State lost. That judgment changed the criteria whereby the HSE is liable. I have to ask a question based on the inertia from the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Government. Is the State Claims Agency literally waiting for women to die because it will be cheaper for the State because of the law, which the Chief Justice has said needs to be amended, whereby the next of kin pursuing cases will not get the same amount of award?</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The Tánaiste asked for solutions in his previous contribution. Last September, I sent the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, a civil liabilities (amendment) Bill to deal with this issue and I said I would work with him. There has not been an iota. The Taoiseach rang me about this and explained it all but not an iota. Not alone this but the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, could not even engage properly to fulfil the requests of the 221+ group on the CervicalCheck tribunal, which is now out also for an overwhelming majority of women. This is proven by the fact there are almost 200 cases lining up in the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Will the Tánaiste and the Government direct the State Claims Agency to act in a humane and quick way for all of the women where negligence is not being disputed so that Lynsey and all those who follow her will be treated in a better way and allowed to spend their precious time with their families?</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I thank the Deputy very much for raising this issue again. I agree with him that it is not something we should be sparring about. It is too sensitive for that. My thoughts are with Lynsey Bennett today and particularly with her daughters Zoe and Haley. I hope her treatment goes as well as possible and that she gets as much time as is possible with her daughters. I do not know the details of this case because, as the Deputy knows, once things go to law they are handled by legal people rather than politicians. I understand from media reports that the case was settled. I am sorry it was not settled sooner. I do not know whether it could have been settled sooner but it is a good thing that it was settled. The term "trial" is a legal term. It applies to any court hearing but I accept that may not be the way people hear it so I am happy to rephrase and use the term "hearing" rather than "trial" because perhaps it is more sensitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Like I have said, I am not familiar with the details of the case and, therefore, I do not want to comment on it. When something goes to law, by law it is handled by the State Claims Agency. That law was passed by the Oireachtas. The answer to the Deputy's question on whether the State Claims Agency can be directed to deal with cases in a humane and quick way where negligence is not disputed is "Yes". I have done this at meetings with the head of the State Claims Agency. I am sure we can emphasise and reiterate this point again. Where negligence is not disputed, these cases should be settled quickly, sensitively and in a humane way. I absolutely agree with the Deputy in this regard. Where a problem will arise is where facts are disputed. That will happen in some cases where the doctors and scientists will say they did not misread the smear, and they are also entitled to have their side of the story heard. We do not want that to happen in courts. This is why we established the CervicalCheck tribunal. This has now been established and it will allow cases to be fast-tracked. It will allow them to be heard in a more sensitive way and, hopefully, it will produce quicker and better outcomes for the women concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> The Civil Liability Act is under review by the Government and the options are being considered. It is a complicated legal area, as I understand it, and there are issues about retrospectivity. It is something that is being examined by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">The Tánaiste needs to direct the State Claims Agency to deal with these issues quickly and more sensitively, particularly where negligence has been found. It was found in this case, it has been found in a number of other cases and it will be found in a number of future cases. We will judge the Tánaiste's words over the coming weeks and months. I have drafted a civil liability Bill but I have had no engagement from the Government. Why is this? The tribunal is a waste of time because the 221+ group will not support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">That is not the answer. If it was the answer, there would not be 200 cases lining up in the High Court as I stand here.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Finally, and more to the point, many women watching that yesterday, and watching Vicky Phelan in the United States at this moment in time, are getting worried. They want to have their smears done but they cannot get appointments. My colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, had to ring around to five GPs to get an appointment. The Well Woman clinics are not taking appointments at the moment. Will the Government, through the HSE, ensure a lessening of this worry and stress and that, on the CervicalCheck website, a list of GPs and clinics that are taking appointments will be put up so the women of Ireland can have some solace that they will be able to get appointments? If they are delayed, we all know the consequences.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I thank the Deputy. As he knows, the Oireachtas some time ago decided that the management of medical negligence cases should be delegated to the State Claims Agency. That is the law. I think it might even have been brought in by Deputy Brendan Howlin as Minister, giving that power to the State Claims Agency to manage medical negligence cases on behalf of the State, so these are not dealt with by politicians or Ministers, and Ministers have no input into how these cases are managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I am not sure if the Government even has the authority to make a direction to the State Claims Agency. We have asked it, we have advised it and we have told it - I have done it in meetings with the head of the State Claims Agency - that where negligence is not disputed, these cases should be settled quickly, sensitively and in a kind and decent manner. We will restate that message to it and I can give the Deputy that assurance. I know the Taoiseach feels the same about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> In regard to women getting their smear tests, I think we all agree. Today is World Cancer Day. We know that cervical screening works and we know it has reduced mortality - the number of women who die from that disease - by nearly 7% year-on-year. It is a very successful programme, notwithstanding the problems that have been encountered. I will certainly take up the issue as to whether we can do that on the website and give women information about which GPs will provide the service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_226">Nursing homes have been the ground zero of the Covid crisis. A total of 1,543 people have died in nursing homes since the start of the crisis and 369 people have died in nursing homes with Covid just in the last month; and my deepest sympathy goes to each and every one of those families. I am not aware of so many people dying so quickly in any other institutions in the history of this State. In the month of January, Covid has been out of control in nursing homes, to devastating effect, with 193 outbreaks in one month.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> We in Aontú have been calling for a public investigation into what has happened in the nursing homes since the start of last year. We did this so the State would learn from the mistakes made and make sure it prevented them in the future. The investigation did not happen and the mistakes were repeated. In the last couple of days, I have reached out to many nursing homes around the country, and I have to say the reports coming back from those nursing homes have been devastatingly uniform. The delay in the vaccine has led to hundreds of deaths - that is what I am being told from the nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Take Greenpark nursing home in Tuam, for example. It survived thus far without any infections only to witness 35 of the 49 residents test positive in the week they were due to receive the vaccine. One fifth of those residents have now died. In Blackrock Abbey near Dundalk, 14 people have died, one man dying just a week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. Nazareth House lost 11 people to Covid in two weeks, and I am told the cemetery for those men who died in Nazareth House is akin to a war grave at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> These deaths happened just before the vaccine was to be administered. It took two weeks from when the vaccines arrived in Ireland until they were first administered in a nursing home. That is a scandal. Why did it happen? Why were just 10% of the initial 77,000 vaccines that were administered by mid-January administered in a nursing home? It is a scandal. Who is responsible for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> It is heartbreaking to see the devastation that has happened in nursing homes the length and breadth of this country. Those nursing homes are still in crisis. What is doubly heart-breaking is that many of those deaths could have been prevented. They could have been prevented with timely action with regard to these vaccines. Yet, from the Minister for Health, every single interviewer struggles to get a specific date on which vaccines will be rolled out. Why is the Minister for Health allergic to specific dates with regard to delivery of vaccines, especially to nursing homes?</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_78" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_231">I thank the Deputy. More than 3,000 people in this State and nearly 5,000 people on this island have lost their lives as a consequence of, or at least with, Covid-19, and our condolences go to all of those families, and all who are still grieving in Ireland, North and South. Sadly, it is the case across the developed world that a very high proportion of people who have died from Covid, or died with Covid, were residents of nursing homes. Ireland is not unique in that regard. Even in countries where they have had a very low number of deaths, like Norway and New Zealand, for example, the majority have occurred among residents of nursing homes, care homes or rest homes, as they use the term, and it does not always mean a failing on behalf of the nursing homes or the people who work there, or the health services or the State. The truth is that people who live in nursing homes tend to be very elderly and tend to have underlying conditions and, therefore, are at higher risk of getting very sick and dying if they get coronavirus.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Once coronavirus is prevalent in the community, it is very hard to keep it out of a nursing home, in the same way that it is not possible to keep flu out of a nursing home in any given winter. For exactly this reason, because nursing home residents are at such high risk of getting sick and dying from this virus, they were the group that was prioritised for vaccination. The decision was made to prioritise two groups, nursing home residents and staff, because nursing home residents are at the highest risk of dying from the virus, and our healthcare staff, because they are at a very high risk of contracting the virus and getting sick from it, and we need them to stay well so they can staff our hospitals and nursing homes. Those two groups were prioritised ahead of anyone else. Lots of other countries gave vaccines to politicians, Government members, senior officials - you name it - ahead of nursing homes and health care staff. We took a decision in this country to prioritise our healthcare staff and nursing home residents and staff, and I believe that was the right decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> I think it is a little simplistic and not entirely correct to say that had the vaccines started a week or two earlier in nursing homes, lives would have been saved. The Deputy cannot say that definitively. He should bear in mind it is only two or three weeks after people get the first dose that they get protection, and only two or three weeks after the second dose that they get full protection, so I do not think the Deputy can necessarily draw the conclusions that he draws.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> In terms of responsibility, the decision on prioritisation was made by the National Immunisation Advisory Council, with the support of NPHET. The practical roll-out of the vaccine was carried out by the HSE and, I think, in fairness to the HSE, it has done a really good job; once it has got the vaccines, it has got them out to people. It is a shame we did not get the vaccines a month or two months earlier but we did not, and those things were not under our control.</p>

        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_235">If the Tánaiste wants to contradict the medical professionals I have spoken to in some of these nursing homes with regard to the timing of delivery of vaccines into those nursing homes, he can, but timing is key, and every single nursing home that is experiencing the wave at the moment will tell him that timing has been absolutely shocking. Things could not have been worse with regard to the timing that has happened. The roll-out of the vaccine in the first number of weeks in this State was scandalously slow.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The other issue that comes up with nursing homes is the fact they are struggling with regard to staff. Nursing home after nursing home will tell the Tánaiste that if any of their staff gets Covid, they are wiped out and they struggle to get replacements. I have asked the Tánaiste about Be On Call for Ireland and he has given me loads of excuses why it has not been used. I got a reply to a parliamentary question this week which states there are 680 people on the Be On Call for Ireland database who are job-ready and ready to go. How can a human resource so critically needed be available and not be used by the State in a sector that is experiencing so much death and destruction?</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I thank the Deputy. The sad fact is it could have been worse - it could have been much worse. Many countries around the world have not even started their vaccination programmes yet, and most EU countries are well behind us. We are in the top three or four European countries now in terms of the speed of the roll-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Yes, there are countries ahead of us, the United Kingdom, the United States and Israel, for example, but those countries are not part of the European Union. The vaccine was approved earlier in those places than it was here. That is not something that was under our control as a Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_239"> The majority of nursing home staff and residents have received a first dose of the vaccine. Some have received the second dose. In some cases it was not possible to give the vaccine because either the residents had coronavirus at the time or were sick or ineligible for another reason. Now the HSE is sweeping back to about 100 nursing homes to ensure they vaccinate anyone who was missed or could not have been vaccinated earlier. </p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_240">Around the country, community employment, CE, workers do valuable work, especially in small towns and villages in rural Ireland. The work they do for Tidy Towns and making Ireland look better is commendable. Prior to 3 July 2017, those over 55 years were entitled to six years on that scheme. It was changed on 3 July so that thereafter a person would get three years, and if he or she took a year out, he or she could apply again. That was accepted. It was updated again in September 2019. On page 30 of the community employment procedures manual, the gospel of the Department which is given to every CE supervisor, it states that participants who started before 3 July 2017 are eligible to remain on the scheme for the six years. That was accepted by all. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the Department has decided not to accept its own rules. We now face situations where people who are eligible under the guidelines, the gospel that is given to the CE scheme supervisors, to stay on schemes for six years must take a year out and reapply. Will the Tánaiste approach the Department or contact the Minister and resolve this issue? The Department cannot have its bible of rules and regulations that everyone adheres to and six months or a year later try to move the goalposts. There are some 19,500 people on the scheme around the country and, unfortunately, about 1,500 to 2,000 vacancies. People adhered to all the regulations as did the supervisors who took them on. If the Department does not change its attitude, I believe it will be wide open to legal challenge. It would be common sense for the Tánaiste to speak to the Minister on this and to tell the Department to adhere to its own guidelines. I ask him to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I will do that. I will contact with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, today or tomorrow to raise this. I agree that if the Department writes a set of guidelines it should follow them. I will definitely look into that and see what the situation is. I very much agree with the Deputy that community employment schemes, rural and urban alike, do really valuable work that needs to be done, whether it is Tidy Towns, meals-on-wheels, community centres or sports clubs. It also provides valuable work experience for people to help them get on a pathway to work, education or training. At the same time, it is important that we have churn and turnover, and that we do not have people staying on CE schemes for years and years or even for life because we need those opportunities to be made available to others and we need people to move on, using their experience of the CE scheme, to mainstream employment or other training and education opportunities. We do appreciate that for some, and there may be people who have difficulty holding down a job in the regular job market, that this can be a valuable alternative too. That is understood.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. I agree with him wholeheartedly. Under the community employment procedures manual, it is called a saver clause. On page 30, it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_243">Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage. If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">What is written in the manual is pretty much black and white. However for some reason, there are people in the Department trying to move the goalposts. As the Tánaiste rightly pointed out, it has been of huge help to people's mental health for them to be out there, helping their community, doing work in it, and perhaps for some, getting to say hello to people, helping work against rural isolation. I thank the Tánaiste for his reply and ask again that he get on to the Minister immediately to resolve this.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I return to an issue I raised 11 months ago. In May, four small pubs launched a High Court action against one of the biggest players in the insurance industry, FBD Insurance. The judgment is to be handed down tomorrow. The case was taken over FBD's refusal to pay out on business interruption as a result of Covid-19 and thousands of businesses hold similar policies with FBD and, indeed, other insurers. Last month the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in Britain won a similar case in the Supreme Court taken on behalf of policyholders. Our Central Bank took no such action. Whatever tomorrow's ruling may be, and that will be independent of everything else, we risk seeing a tidal wave of litigation which would be costly and slow for thousands of businesses. There is an alternative. Will the Tánaiste support me in calling for the Central Bank to put in place an examination similar to the tracker mortgage examination where there is an audit of policies, clear expectations set for insurers and intrusive supervision by the Central Bank with strict enforcement and heavy sanctions for insurers that fail to live up to these expectations? It is time for the Central Bank to defend the interests of these businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I will certainly give it consideration. If the Deputy wishes to write to me or to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on the details, we will give it some thought. As the Deputy said, the pubs versus FBD Insurance decision is expected tomorrow. These are significant test cases. It will be interesting to see what decision the courts make. It will have a significant impact potentially on lots of other businesses which had interruption insurance. The question arises whether or not pandemics are covered. I look forward to reading the judgment, reflecting on it and seeing what are its implications.</p>

Did that happen? We all know now there will be issues in the roll-out of the vaccine for those over 70 years. I am decoding what the Tánaiste said earlier but essentially we will not have the same amount of vaccine, given yesterday's decision on AstraZeneca. Was the decision made and can the Tánaiste tell the House the date for when all front-line Covid-facing healthcare workers will be fully vaccinated?</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> I am dealing with a situation in my home hospital of Nenagh where many of the staff have not been vaccinated. There has been a Covid outbreak there.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">They are so scared because of the scale of Covid-19 in the hospital. When will all of our doctors, nurses and other Covid facing front-line workers be vaccinated? Surely the Tánaiste has a date.</p>

          <p eId="para_255"> To clarify, the number of doses we will receive has not gone down. It is still 1.2 million between the start of the year and the end of March. We will still be able to start vaccinating the over 85s from the middle of February. </p>

Those recordings were never fully transcribed and they have since been destroyed. That is despite assurances from the Minister in October that survivors would be able to access their own stories and also a clause in the 2004 Commissions of Investigation Act that the commission is required to retain all evidence it receives. It has been reported that the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, has contacted the commission regarding the destruction of these files. However, the commission is due to be dissolved on 28 February, which is only a few weeks away. It is very important that we do not fail these survivors again. Will the Government immediately extend the term of the commission to enable a full investigation of the destruction of these files and the recovery of any information possible?</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I thank the Deputy. I only heard about that the other day and was quite surprised to hear it, quite frankly. It is something I know the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is now aware of and it will be a decision for him as to whether it makes sense to further extend the term of the commission. It is important to say once again that the mother and baby homes commission is independent of Government. It was established by the Oireachtas. It is not controlled by the Government or a creature of Government. Commissions, by their very nature, just like tribunals, are independent bodies. Perhaps one of the flaws in the process is an independent body like a commission can spend five years hearing evidence, examining evidence and making its report but then is not there to explain it. One is then left, as a Government Minister, trying to explain a report that one had no role in actually drawing up. I do not blame the members of the commission for that in any way but if we are going to do another inquiry on a similar issue, we need to look at a better way to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I raise with the Tánaiste the future of the Dean Maxwell nursing home in Roscrea. I do so in the context of the current review of the national development plan. Community groups in Roscrea have combined to make an application for funding to build a new Dean Maxwell care home and community hub. This is an essential infrastructural development, which would deliver a comprehensive range of services for those in need of elderly care in Roscrea and district.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> For more than 50 years, north Tipperary had three centres of elderly care - Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea. When the last health plan was formulated the HSE, with political encouragement, downgraded Roscrea. I raised this matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health a few months ago. The Minister for Health, at my request, organised a meeting with senior executives in the HSE. At this meeting, the HSE outlined its true intentions. It is the policy and intention of the HSE to move long-stay beds out of the Dean Maxwell unit to Nenagh. The Dean Maxwell unit would then become a short-stay unit with no meaningful future. Through this policy the Dean Maxwell unit is effectively consigned to closure by stealth. This would have disastrous consequences in terms of the delivery of elderly care for the citizens in Roscrea. We cannot allow the services in Roscrea be sacrificed. This unforgivable injustice must be addressed. I ask the Tánaiste for the timescale involved in the process for appraisal, evaluation and assessment of applications under the plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this important issue. Senator Ahearn and Deputy Cahill have been in touch with my office about it also. The Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit needs to be upgraded and modernised to meet Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards. I have been informed that it has been asked to make a submission to the review of the national development plan and that it has done exactly that. That review is under way. I do not have an exact timeline but we would expect to have the review completed within a couple of months. I want to acknowledge the importance of having such a unit in Roscrea. I will certainly make the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, aware that it was raised by the Deputy again today.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">We all expected teething problems on 1 January with regard to Brexit. Irish Road Haulage Association hauliers and many private haulage companies and car importers have been on to me and many other politicians about this issue. There are anomalies in the 300 page document and nobody in Revenue, who are doing their best, can give people an answer as to why they must pay the import duty at the point of entry. When they bring in cars they pay the VRT when they sell them and register them. That should be done now with this also.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Drivers of trucks are being held up, sometimes for 24 and 48 hours. That is totally unfair to them. They are innocent here. If there are cars for four or five garages on the one load one driver might not have money in the account to pay whatever is the sum. They will have to pay it later on because it is registered and documented. We need to have this document simplified. We need to have the Minister for Finance, the head of Revenue and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance deal with this to give clarity and stop the chaos at the ports.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">I thank the Deputy. I will certainly check that out. Every day there is a new problem when it comes to Brexit. There are many teething problems, as the Deputy says, but it is important to admit that they are not all teething problems. Britain has left the Single Market and the customs union. Frictionless trade with Britain is over. Checks, charges, controls and paperwork are now the new reality when it comes to trade with Britain. That was their decision. We regret it but we have to deal with it. While we will try to minimise disruption for business it will not be possible to eliminate it entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Wilker Auto Conversions, in Offaly, has announced that staff will be laid off there for about three weeks in respect of supply issues as a result of Brexit. Enterprise Ireland and my Department are reaching out to the company today to see if we can help out in any way but I understand that a three-week temporary lay-off is the worst case scenario and the employees will be re-hired after three weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">At the moment, it is not possible for somebody to do a driver theory test. A mass of people are looking to get their licences. One cannot get a Safe Pass. Is there any way of trying to allow them do something online? I was talking to a guy yesterday who has been driving a car for 25 years. He has to have the trailer licence for which one has to do a theory test. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, might be fond of bikes but cars, lorries, tractors and so on are needed in this country. Could some commonsense measure not be brought in by the Department of Transport, and I understand we are in a pandemic, to allow people make applications online straightaway? Three or four months is too long to wait and too many people who have the prospect of work cannot go to work because of the situation in which they are caught.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">I thank the Deputy. Again, I will check that out with the Road Safety Authority, RSA. I do not see why it could not be done online but I can see an obvious difficulty. How would one know that the person who is doing the test online in their own home is actually the person who is supposed to be doing the test? There would be a difficulty with that. I will definitely make contact with the RSA and see if we can do something because I appreciate the problem is a real one.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">The programme for Government commits to a technological university for the south east. I am sure the Tánaiste will agree with me that this is a hugely important project for everybody in the south east. Two issues have arisen over the past number of weeks which need clarification. The first is that there is a lack of certainty in respect of where the headquarters of that new university will be located. There is a lot of speculation, which I do not believe is helpful. We need clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">There is a lack of clarity in the process in terms of the criteria that will determine where the headquarters will be. It should be where the critical mass of students is. That makes perfect sense. There are also issues with the required capital funding to increase the footprint of both campuses in Waterford and Carlow. I know Waterford Institute of Technology has made an application to the national development plan for a revised application of €200 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Will the Tánaiste confirm that this will be accepted? What is the level of capital funding that will be delivered? How will a decision be made on the headquarters?</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I am a really strong supporter of a technological university for the south east. We were not able to make it happen in the previous Government but I am determined it will happen in the early part of this Government, if not in the next couple of months. It is a very important project for the south east, both in terms of enabling students to stay in or come to the region and, from an IDA Ireland perspective, getting more investment in the south east, which is required. It is also helpful for spin-off companies and can help drive the creation of jobs, and higher quality jobs in particular, in the south east, which is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I understand the decision on where a headquarters would be located is for the technological university board, and I assume it will make that decision. As a Government, we are very strongly supportive of expanding the footprint of the technological university in Waterford city and are examining the old Waterford Crystal site in particular as a potential site that could be purchased and used to expand the technological university once established.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">The Government and its Minister with responsibility for housing in particular have indicated they want to end the housing crisis but there are vacant houses lying idle right across the State. A solution I have suggested for years, and which I put to the Minister last year, concerns these vacant properties. Currently, the Government puts out two calls per year for local authorities to refurbish vacant properties. There is a cap on the process and it is hampered by red tape and bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> I call for a straightforward fast-track approach that would give local authorities the ability to get these vacant houses returned to the housing stock. They are a magnet for antisocial behaviour and dumping, destroying the communities they are in. Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister and his departmental officials whey they are stopping local authorities getting vacant properties back to the housing stock? It is breaking the hearts of people on housing waiting lists to look at this.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">As the Deputy knows, there are different types of vacant housing. There are the types in the ownership of local authorities, and those that are not and are privately owned. Funding is available to local authorities to restore and renovate voids in their ownership in order to make them available for people on the housing list. That process has sped up a lot in the past couple of years and the councils have done a good job on that. With privately owned vacant houses, local authorities have compulsory purchase order powers. Some local authorities, including the Louth council, have done a really good job with those powers but others could do much better.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I thank the national immunisation advisory committee for its really important advice on vaccinations. Data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, last week demonstrate that successfully reaching people aged over 65 would stop 93% of deaths that have occurred from Covid-19, whereas reaching those with underlying conditions would stop 87% of people having to enter intensive care units.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Successful vaccination is really important but we cannot count any chickens before they hatch. Could we devote the sort of attention that is being devoted to reopening education safely to reopening some of the other areas that are affected by level 5 and level 4 restrictions? I am thinking about mental health services, childcare, safe pods for isolated people, worship and outdoor activity. With warmer weather, could we find ways to improve ventilation and use antigen testing to make such venues or activities safer? There is potential that could be explored.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">Under level 5 restrictions, we are allowed to reopen educational facilities. That will happen on a phased basis, starting with special schools quite soon, along with childcare and construction. Much work is being done to enable the safe reopening of those sectors. We are loath to speak too much about opening other sectors because we do not want to give rise to anticipatory behaviour. We know when people anticipate the easing of restrictions, they tend to drop their guard, and we do not want that to happen on this occasion. There is no guarantee we will be able to ease restrictions on 5 March but we hope to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> We are expecting updated guidance on ventilation, which is really important, and it is increasingly acknowledged that good ventilation is one of the tools we can use to prevent the spread of this virus. That is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> Antigen testing is more complicated and the view from the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Health Emergency Team is that antigen testing, including mass antigen testing, misses too many positive cases. In one test, it missed five from six positive cases. They have indicated it is only particularly useful in symptomatic cases and outbreaks but not as a mass screening tool for travel, schools, events or anything like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">This Government made commitments to survivors of the mother and baby homes but the audio testimonies they gave have suddenly been deleted. I can tell the Tánaiste how this has affected one of the survivors; it is only one story and every Member in the House would have heard similar stories from other survivors. When the lady in question read her so-called testimony in the written report, she realised that apart from the first two lines, the words on the paper were not those that came from her mouth. She was so appalled she cannot bring herself to read the rest of the report. She has said this has set her back - the opposite of what this process was supposed to do - but she was thankful the interview was recorded. At the weekend she was stunned to learn the recordings had been deleted. She is adamant she was never informed that this would happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The Tánaiste cannot blame people for questioning motives in this case. This lady is demanding to know why, when survivors have pointed out irregularities in the transcripts, the only real proof of the misrepresentation was suddenly deleted. Who approved the deletion of the tapes? This lady and all the survivors deserve answers.</p>

          <p eId="para_297"> The commission of investigation did the job it was asked to in terms of gathering evidence and making findings. One element very much missing from that process was the opportunity for survivors to tell their story in a public forum.

Documents I have seen suggest that gardaí reported on this the day before the examination took place. The child was also the subject of a specialist Garda interview that does not appear to have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The programme for Government outlines supports and therapeutic services for vulnerable children but today this child has no services or support. Tusla has closed the case, despite numerous referrals from various agencies, including Barnardo's. I have highlighted this case to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth so will the Government work with him to examine the systematic failures that took place and also to find other children who may not have been best served by similar failures?</p>

Some have already received two doses, and all will by the end of March 2021. We will now be able to prioritise the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for healthcare workers such as GPs and nurses. I think home helps are in a different category. They may well be in category 6, but I will have to double check. I did hear that Bantry Hospital had very successfully provided the vaccine to its staff. It is not all bad in west Cork. I am glad to see that Bantry Hospital was able to vaccinate its staff in the last few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The issue of cystic fibrosis has been raised on a number of occasions. We will take it up with the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.

We have raised with NIAC the issue of whether people who are aged under 70 or 65 and have chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, or are transplant patients, for example, should be prioritised and put into a different group.

Whilst no payments have been made to any families, children or parents, the State has paid €700,000 in defence costs. It is defending the indefensible.

Not being able to see their best friends, remote learning and uncertainty around exams are all causing heightened anxiety. Some 20 children have been put on the mental health waiting list in the south of Wexford over the last eight months. Another 49 children are waiting on support from child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in the north of the county.

          <p eId="para_310">The budget for the HSE this year provides for it to take on an extra 16,000 staff. Never, in any one year before, has the HSE had the authority or budget to recruit so many additional staff. I hope that includes the hiring of some of the staff in Wexford mentioned by the Deputy. I will ensure that the HSE is aware that he raised the issue today.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> On the issue of assessments of need, the Government acknowledges that these assessments are happening far too slowly. There is provision for additional staffing. There will have to be better organisation procedures as well. We know from bitter experience that additional staff and resources does not always mean shorter waiting lists and better outcomes. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working very hard on that particular issue. I absolutely agree that the money would be much better spent providing services than on legal fees. However, that is the difficulty once things go legal. </p>

          <p eId="para_312">Traditionally, Ireland has rejected racism in all shapes and forms, and rightly so. However, in recent times there appears to have been a sneaking back into the system and a tacit acceptance of racism. I ask the Tánaiste whether it might be expedient now to introduce legislation to address this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">The Government is open to proposals for new legislation in this area. We are already in the process of updating the legislation on incitement to hatred.

          <p eId="para_314">The parents of children at the Drogheda Educate Together Secondary School on Mill Road in east Meath have recently been informed that the school is to move to a site at St. Oliver's Community College on the far side of Drogheda. There was no consultation whatsoever with the teachers, board of management or the parents. Parents are rightly asking how the Department can say that a temporary school can be built on the St. Oliver's site by this coming September, yet the additional seven classrooms needed on the current site cannot be provided. They are rightly asking why the school should have to move. The site was specifically identified to cater for the increase in population in the east Meath and south Louth area. It is a totally illogical decision. It is the equivalent of moving a secondary school from north County Dublin to south County Dublin. That is how impractical it is. Will the Tánaiste investigate the Department's reasons for the decision and the illogical nature of it and when this decision will be reversed?</p>

Its five classrooms are less than half the size of standard primary school classrooms and are housed in dilapidated, pre-fabricated buildings. Walls are paper-thin, to the extent that they cannot support wall-mounted hand sanitiser. The floors have rotted, been replaced and are rotting again. Technical assessments on the need for a new school building were eventually conducted by the Department, but nothing more. I ask the Tánaiste to contact his Government colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and to ask them to engage directly with the staff and parents at Stepping Stones on this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the opportunity to make a statement and take questions relating to the early learning and childcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Before I begin, it is appropriate to recognise that tomorrow is the anniversary of the huge march that took place on 5 February 2020, when a coalition of groups across the early learning and childcare sector took to the streets, seeking better pay, conditions and supports for the sector. Around 30,000 people joined them on that march. I know that tomorrow, last year’s march will be remembered through online actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> All our lives have changed so much in the scope and context of the last year. I am very conscious that, across the duration of the entire pandemic, the early learning and childcare sector has shown real leadership, with the return to services in June of last year and the fact that this January the sector remained open for vulnerable children and the children of essential workers. Early learning and childcare professionals and providers have kept services open at a time of real anxiety across all of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">As Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and as a member of Government, I offer my thanks to everybody in the sector for all they have done and all that they continue to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The initial closures of early learning and childcare services from March to June last year created major challenges for children and their families and led to significant pressures on a range of essential services, including our health system. That is why ensuring these services can continue to operate during the current restrictions has been a priority for me and for Government.<b>
						</b>On the announcement of the closure of services on 12 March, my Department immediately moved to guarantee continued State funding for the sector for the initial closure period. The subsequent introduction of the temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme by my Department was crucial in ensuring the sustainability of the sector during the closure period by ensuring the workforce could be retained and that parents could retain places for their children, without charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> The €75 million reopening funding package negotiated in June supported more than 1,500 providers that normally operate during the summer months to reopen their doors. In preparation for the full reopening of the sector from 1 September, I secured a sector-wide exemption, the only one of its kind, to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS. With enhanced EWSS rates in place since October 2020, the scheme is estimated to cover, on average, 80% of payroll costs or 50% of full operating costs of these services, allowing them to operate sustainably even with much reduced occupancy levels. The estimated cost of this investment the State is putting into the early childcare sector is more than €7 million per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Owing to increased cases of Covid-19 in the community and to reduce levels of movement, the Government took the decision in early January to delay the resumption of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and restrict access to other early learning and childcare services to the children of essential workers and to vulnerable children. During January, my Department continued to provide funding under its schemes as long as early learning and childcare services remained open or had been directed or approved to close. The extension of these restrictions beyond 31 January demanded a different approach to funding that would ensure the significant public money which is being invested is structured in a fair and balanced way to help achieve a range of objectives. Those objectives include ensuring early learning and childcare remains open for parents who work in an essential service and for children who are vulnerable, enabling providers to reimburse parents if they do not take up services, supporting providers to retain their staff, and supporting providers' sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> To provide Deputies with more detail, over the period from 1 February to 5 March this year, services that are open will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under all other Department schemes. They can also receive the additional 30% of the value of ECCE programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that include waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible. In the case of services that are closed, where the closure is approved by my Department, they will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes. This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible. We have also put in place a newly designed Covid-19 operating support payment to give additional support to some providers that have a significant reliance on parental fee income, allowing them to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable. During all of this period, the enhanced EWSS rates are available and remain central to my Department's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Our response is informed by evidence. In designing these funding arrangements, officials in my Department relied on the best available evidence to inform their work, including real-time data on reported occupancy levels among services. Our response is informed by stakeholders. Contributions from all parts of the sector, including extensive consultation with the Covid-19 expert advisory group, which I have met on seven occasions since 30 December, were instrumental. Our response is child and family centred. As well as addressing the needs of providers and their staff, we have sought to meet the needs of children and families at this time. The condition attached to funding to waive fees for parents not using the service offers certainty and will bring some relief to parents. The condition to engage with children remotely, where possible, means children can remain connected to their caregivers and retain some sense of normality. Our response is informed by public health guidance. In developing the necessary supports for the sector, my Department continued to work closely with the HSE regarding the latest public health advice. Just last week, at the request of the Department, the HSE hosted a webinar for the sector that was attended by more than 3,000 participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Our response is paying dividends. More than 1,800 early learning and childcare services are currently open and providing childcare to the children of essential workers and to vulnerable children. The city and county childcare committees are providing a matching service to help essential workers who need a childcare place to find one locally, particularly where their needs are new and temporary due to the closure of schools at this time. Those parents can avail of the national childcare scheme, NCS, subsidies. Undoubtedly, work remains to be done. My officials are now making preparations for arrangements from 5 March. As part of those preparations, they are engaging with the Department of Education. There is also continued engagement with the HSE, with further engagement with the Covid-19 expert advisory group planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> I would like to update Deputies on the programme for Government commitment to support the establishment of a joint labour committee, JLC, for the sector and the drawing up of an employment regulation order. In December 2020, working in partnership with SIPTU and Childhood Services Ireland-IBEC, I began a short process in which interested parties were invited to discuss how best to address issues of pay and conditions in the sector and how a JLC might support this. I appointed Dr. Kevin Duffy, a former chairman of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of the process. I am very grateful to him for the expertise he has shown in chairing and leading forward this important process. The series of meetings concluded earlier this week and Dr. Duffy will shortly submit to me a report outlining the issues and possible solutions raised in the process and making a recommendation on next steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I recognise that there are many further steps to be taken but I understand that there is broad agreement on the potential benefits of regulating wages in the sector and on the possible benefits of establishing a JLC as a way forward. I welcome the commitment that all parties have shown in engaging in the process so far. I am very hopeful that progress will continue over the months ahead. On the eve of a national day of action by the sector over pay and conditions, I hope this positive development and the wider work my Department has done on Covid-19, future funding and workforce development signals the Government's commitment and intention to play its part in resolving the crucial issue of pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> I would like to conclude by acknowledging the ongoing efforts of everyone involved in early learning and childcare to maintain high-quality services for children and their families in the most difficult of circumstances. The Covid-19 crisis has created huge challenges for us all. I again pay tribute to this cohort of essential workers for all that they have achieved in the past year and for continuing to put children and their families at the heart of their work.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneRabbitte" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Anne Rabbitte)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_331">I would like to be associated with the Minister's remarks in paying tribute to childcare providers and their staff. While rapid Government responses to the Covid-19 pandemic continue to be required, long-term and long-lasting development and reform are ever more important. A development and reform agenda has been under way in the Department for some time and Deputies will be aware of the progress made. New regulations in 2016 introduced a minimum qualification requirement for the early learning and care workforce for the first time. A contractual requirement for a higher level of qualification is in place for the ECCE programme. The higher capitation payment under that programme has incentivised graduate employment, which is now at 25% of the workforce. When I first became a Deputy four years ago, that figure was at 4%. The learner fund has provided financial support to thousands of practitioners to upskill. New criteria and guidelines have been produced to support the development of education programmes in early learning and care at levels 5 to 8 of the national framework of qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> There has been a 141% increase in State investment in the sector since 2015. In recent years the number of children benefiting from the ECCE programme and other State subsidies has doubled. Barriers to participation for children with disability have been removed with the introduction and roll-out of the award-winning access and inclusion model. Despite this progress, many challenges remain. The high turnover in the workforce is of particular concern as research suggests that children are affected by the continuity of their experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The average wage in the sector is just €12.55 per hour. Forty-four percent of the staff work part-time and 40% are on seasonal contracts, making employment in the sector an unattractive option for many. Despite unprecedented levels of investment, Ireland still trails behind international investment norms, and costs to parents still remain among the highest in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> First 5, Ireland's first ever whole-of-government strategy to support babies, young children and their families, commits to significantly developing and reforming the early learning and childcare system. Three major targets have been set to be delivered over the lifetime of the strategy: there will be a graduate-led early learning and care workforce, with at least 50% of the staff working directly with children holding an appropriate degree qualification; all regulated school-age childcare staff and childminders will hold a minimum qualification; and the level of State investment in early learning and care and school-aged childcare will at least double from the 2019 baseline of €574 million. To ensure we meet these ambitious workforce targets, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department are developing a workforce development plan that will raise the profile of carers in early learning care and the care of school-aged children; establish a career framework and leadership development opportunities; set out mechanisms by which representatives of employers and staff can work together to agree salary scales and employment conditions with the backing of the Labour Court; and work towards building a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> To ensure that the additional State investment pledged in First 5 delivers the best outcome for the children and their families, an expert group is developing a new funding model that will continue to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for parents; ensure a range of additional supports can be provided to children from disadvantaged groups; compensate providers so they can deliver early learning and childcare on a sustainable and high-quality basis; attract and retain a well-qualified workforce; and create more supportive working conditions where the workforce feels valued and where there is time for preparation, reflection, teamwork and parental engagement. Work on both projects - the workforce development plan and the funding model - commenced in 2019 and has continued throughout the pandemic. Already, significant progress has been made and extensive engagement has taken place. These coming months will be crucial for both projects in generating proposals and recommendations that the Minister can bring to the Government.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenFunchion" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_336">I have a short statement and about four questions. I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"><b>
						</b>I will start by making a special mention of our early years and childcare professionals, who often feel forgotten and overlooked. They often feel undervalued and ignored. They have been back at work for several weeks now. They have reopened their sector for essential workers and vulnerable children as the third wave of this horrible pandemic rages through the country. Ironically, tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of 30,000 childcare professionals, crèche owners, various practitioners and parents marching though Dublin to demand better terms and conditions. The service they have provided to essential workers and vulnerable children has been so important and a lifeline for so many families. They have really stepped up to the challenges posed by Covid-19, and many services have taken in older children, of school age, to try to help facilitate front-line workers. </p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Early years and childcare professionals were absolutely essential in alleviating the stress many parents felt during the last wave we went through. Their skills, their professionalism and the contribution they make to the education of young children are invaluable. I sincerely thank them for their commitment but they want more than just thanks and admiration; they want and deserve better pay and conditions and they want their work to be valued through action by the Government. They want their voices to be heard. </p>
          <p eId="para_339"> We continue to have a broken childcare system that has been underfunded. The unfortunate reality, which I hear daily, is that people feel the Government does not value early years and childcare professionals. I am aware and appreciate that there has been much focus on protecting people's lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The impact of this terrible disease on our health, freedom, liberty, home-grown businesses, children and mental health, including our children’s mental health cannot be overstated. When we look at the list, we see it is endless. The disease has had an impact on every aspect of our lives. It has, however, presented us with a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely overhaul the current childcare system. The reality is there can be no recovery without a properly funded childcare sector that works for everybody, a strategy that does not simply patch up what we have but that thinks big and is brave.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I am conscious of time so I will move on to my questions. Ironically, my first one covers much of what I have said about wages and terms and conditions for early years educators and childcare professionals. Now that we have the wage subsidy scheme in place, can the Government commit to continuing it after the pandemic? Obviously, the payments would need to be increased and we would need to see a proper wage scale in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> I have three more questions but I am conscious of the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I thank the Deputy for her questions and her recognition of the sector. As she knows, the employee wage subsidy scheme is an all-of-economy support. We were successful in having it applied to the entire childcare sector and in having an exemption from the turnover requirements. It has been essential in supporting the sustainability of services. It is due to end at the end of March, at which time the Government will be reviewing the additional supports that need to be put in place for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I am very conscious of the low wages in the sector. The Government has committed to prioritising addressing that. As I outlined today, we have made the first steps towards that in the pre-JLC process, which I am very pleased to see has taken place successfully. I am to get a report from Dr. Kevin Duffy in the coming days. I look forward to updating the House on the measures I will take to make progress on that.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_344">I thank the Minister. I should have said I recognise that he mentioned the JLC process, with which I am familiar from previous work with SIPTU. I hope it will be beneficial but I believe the Government can actually make the intervention regarding wage scales without having a JLC process. I welcome it as a step in what is definitely the right direction, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> My second question is on emergency funding for the sector. Will it be continued? Will there be increased investment in the sector once we are out of this pandemic?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_143" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">
          <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_346">We have put a very substantial amount of money into the sector to keep it sustainable, keep services open and match the considerable determination of providers and childcare professionals in this regard, both in the context of the continuation of the existing payment schemes and the additional money invested through the employment wage subsidy scheme We are examining what will happen in respect of the measures from 5 March onwards. Obviously, the longer-term funding of the sector is also a key issue. The Deputy is aware of the expert group on funding. It has produced a number of papers already. I hope to have substantial information from it halfway through this year to inform my advocation of additional funding in budget 2022.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I have one more question, on the vaccine. There has been some confusion over whether it is category 6 or category 11. Category 6 refers to "key workers", not childcare workers or early years professionals. I wonder whether the Minister could clarify whether they are in category 6. Are they still in category 11? If the Minister does not know, he may revert to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I acknowledge there is some confusion about that. I regret it if there was any confusion in the ether. Responsibility for the programme rests with the Department of Health and the HSE. Currently, early learning childcare staff and school-age childcare staff are in vaccination category 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I have advocated with the HSE and the Department of Health that that prioritisation continues to be re-examined. I know Deputy Cullinane got a response that indicated a higher priority. I have asked the HSE to contact him and I think it may have done so this morning with a correction on that point. It is important to say that I and my Department continue to engage with the Department of Health on the prioritisation of childcare professionals within the vaccination programme and as evidence changes we will continue to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_350">I raise an issue that my colleague, Deputy Ward, raised with me. It is in relation to the €700,000 the State has spent defending court cases taken in the last two years by parents of children whose assessment of need did not comply with the timeframe within the Disability Act. How can the Government defend spending that amount of taxpayers' money on court cases when it is supposed to ensure that assessments of need for children who have or are suspected to have a disability or learning need be carried out in a timely fashion? It is defending the indefensible, it has to stop and the €700,000 or whatever sum might be available to defend court cases should be spent on the children who need the assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has invested a lot of additional money in getting assessments of need carried out in a more timely fashion and that is welcome. However, it has been pointed out to me time and again that an assessment of need is fine and well but if a therapist is not available to follow up with the treatment identified in the assessment, it is difficult. Parents tell me that children spend years waiting for assessment. Then, when the assessment is done and the needs identified, they spend more years waiting for treatment. I hope something can be done in relation to that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> On children in preschool, some of them missed out on three months last year and four weeks so far this year. Those two years are very important because they prepare them for primary school. Parents worry that it might take ages to settle a child back into preschool when they do get back and to prepare them for primary school. Are there any plans to assist in preparing the children for primary school to make up for the time they have missed in the two preschool years?</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> On the childcare sector generally, the problems relating to pay and conditions continue to exist. Many childcare workers have level 7 or 8 degrees, yet they barely earn the minimum wage or slightly over it. There is, as the Minister of State pointed out, a large turnover here and parents are paying extremely high fees so there needs to be a higher level of investment by the State in childcare on a par with our European counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I am also contacted regularly by workers within the childcare sector wondering if they will be prioritised for the vaccine. They are working with little people who do not understand social distancing. While children are not generally badly affected by Covid, they are carriers of it, so some workers are quite nervous and feel like they are forgotten about.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">My first question relates to the roll-out of the vaccine. There are queries coming into my office from parents of children who have very specific highly dependent needs and where carers are coming into the home or particular settings. They are asking me if any consideration is being given to vaccinating children within the "disability sector" - that might be an unfortunate use of that phrase but I mean where there is a high level of disability and dependency - so that we are vaccinating the child being cared for. Is there any discussion taking place around that cohort at Government level?</p>

          <p eId="para_357">Both I, in my Department, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is still with the Department of Health, continue to advocate for all children in the context of the vaccine programme, but particularly for those who are most vulnerable. If there are particular constituents or others with conditions that the Deputy wishes to highlight, he might correspond with us and we will endeavour to engage with the HSE and the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I thank the Minister. I appreciate his response and I certainly will do that. We have sight of the survey that took place in relation to the early years sector, which I am sure the Ministers have also had sight of. Some 2,000 professionals took part in the survey. It found that 22% of early years educators earn more than the living wage of €12.30 per hour and 90% of all professionals struggle to make ends meet with difficulty or great difficulty. There is an online strike this Friday. The Ministers will be aware of that. We acknowledge that and give it our support, from a Labour Party perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I note the positive commentary in relation to the interaction with Dr. Duffy. I note the Minister's statement that he expects to receive a report within a matter of days. What will determine an outcome that will lead to a recommendation of an improvement in pay and conditions for workers? I doubt the report will, for instance, recommend the<i> status quo</i> remain. One could anticipate with some degree of common sense that there will be an advocacy of an improvement in pay and conditions. If there is such an outcome, how soon thereafter do the Government, the Ministers and the Department anticipate that they will act on those recommendations?</p>

          <p eId="para_360">Like the Deputy, I recognise the online day of action taking place tomorrow marking last year's march and I also recognise the crucial issue of pay and resolving this in the sector. In every session of questions and answers, we have engaged on this matter and we are seeing progression, in that last time we were talking about a JLC preprocess. Now that is done and I am expecting the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The Department is not the employer of childcare professionals. They are employed by private service providers. We are putting in place the infrastructure to bring those representing the employers and those representing the trade union childcare professionals together and we are providing as supportive an environment as we can and wider supports throughout the economy to enable that process. A sustainability fund was introduced by my predecessor, also with a view to sustaining that process. I see the crucial importance of increasing wages across the sector and there will be no lack of speed on my part or that of my Department to take the recommendations we get from Dr. Duffy and work towards implementing them.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">It will be about money flowing into the sector if the Government decides to improve the pay and conditions. The question arises as to the balance of the onus: is the onus on the employer or on the Government through funding via the schemes into improving pay and conditions?

          <p eId="para_364">I thank the Minister and Minister of State and I compliment them on how nimbly they have responded over the period of their responsibility in relation to the pandemic. A number of questions I wanted to ask have been addressed, so I will not go back over them. There might be one or two questions but the bulk of my contribution will be by way of statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The area of childcare has been problematic in Ireland for many years in terms of funding. A previous Minister for Finance sought to deal with the exorbitant cost of childcare in the early 2000s, which approached - as it does now - the cost of a second mortgage, by putting more cash in the pockets of parents through a significant increases in children's allowances. That subdued the discussion for a long period while the economy was roaring. Once those measures were introduced, there was very little reference in subsequent election campaigns from parents to the cost of childcare because it had been covered by the significant increases in children's allowances, much of which has been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> According to a well-worn phrase, it is only when the tide recedes that we see who is not wearing swimming trunks. We heard during a debate earlier today a number of references to a tsunami in respect of children's mental health. It is a word used to describe what we are going through in a range of sectors and Departments and the challenges that face Ministers, but it is only when the tsunami recedes that we will see how childcare has been exposed. We need to have a serious conversation about that and to learn from it. The State has stepped up to the mark - that cannot be understated - and I compliment the Ministers on acting so swiftly in the six or seven months they have been in office. Nevertheless, the figures being invested by the State, despite the State owning nothing in the sector, amount to another example of the State keeping education, health and childcare at arm's length. It has been forced, as a result of the pandemic, and rightly so, to honour the unwritten contract between citizens and the State that guarantees that childcare will be delivered. It is well past time.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Looking at the figures, the EWSS rates have been in place since October 2020. The EWSS is estimated to cover 80% of the payroll costs or 50% of the full operating costs of these services and to cost the State €7 million per week. That amounts in a full year to €364 million. Imagine the State childcare sector that could be provided for €350 million annually. I have advocated for this since 2013 and 2014, in my time as a councillor. There was a massive rapid school-building programme in this country. We ought to have taken advantage of that time to co-locate childcare facilities on primary school sites and make them one-stop shops.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> As the Minister pointed out, the EWSS covers 80% of payroll and 50% of the full operating costs. In suburbia and the cities, one of the highest costs for childcare providers is the capital cost, whether in the form of the mortgage or the repayments. If the State stepped in, with a real partnership providing the infrastructure but employing a blended service of public and private sector workers to operate and manage that, suddenly an awful lot more money could be in place to support those front-line childcare workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> One issue the receding tide has exposed is that the economy simply cannot function without childcare and we have to put a value on that. Perhaps it is something that, in the interim period, the Minister could begin work on and perhaps he could do something radical. The State has shown that in a time of crisis, it will produce whatever funding is needed to support this essential service, so why does the State not get directly involved in providing this service, whether in the workplace for civil and public servants or by co-locating on school sites and other infrastructural sites such as community centres? We could grasp this nettle and something really positive could emerge from it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Flaherty<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_370">A review is under way into the access and inclusion model, AIM, but we are unlikely to see an outcome from it for another two years. In the interest of vulnerable special educational needs, SEN, children in particular, it has to be fast-tracked. I am aware of an early age manager from County Longford who has been in touch with the Minister and the Department. She is desperately seeking funding and support for two children with special needs who, unfortunately, are not yet of ECCE age. It is clear we need a strong suite of supports for SEN children in the early years sector, which means interim support for SEN children who to date do not qualify for additional supports, such as the two children identified in County Longford. In respect of the case brought to the Minister's attention, I know how hard the team at the facility work and the additional strides in training that staff and the owner have undergone to provide the necessary supports for these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> If we are serious about promoting an inclusive service that caters for all children, the operators, parents and staff need to know that the supports will be there to help children who need additional assistance. Of the two young children brought to the Minister's attention by my constituent, one has Angelman syndrome but, unfortunately, as they are outside the ECCE age group, they have no AIM worker, yet the facility is required to provide full-time one-to-one care and supervision. The second child is due to join the facility in March. He too will be outside the ECCE age and, similarly, will need a dedicated primary carer to help ensure he reaches his optimal development.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> We have seen over recent weeks how hard parents of SEN children have to fight for the most basic educational rights. I am heartened by the early efforts that both the Minister and the Minister of State have made, but the clearest signal we can send to parents and children, if we are serious about SEN education, is to address it from the bottom up. We need to set out a marker for ourselves and how we move forward with the early years education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I could sum up my contribution but I do not think I could accurately communicate the magnitude of the problem or of the issues facing many early education providers. If the House will indulge me, I will endeavour to give voice to the young crèche and preschool owner from County Longford who stated her case so eloquently and passionately in her email to the Minister. She wrote that these children come from working-class backgrounds and that she is appalled and ashamed that people like her need to beg and plead on behalf of the children and their families for the Government to listen to them and to put appropriate supports in place for the children and many others in the country who are in a similar position.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">I am aware of that case. As the Deputy noted, the AIM funding does not apply to those children, although it is a very beneficial and useful scheme. There is a gap in the provision at the moment, but we recognise it and the Minister of State and I, at the higher level, will be conscious of addressing it. When the Minister of State's disability brief moves to my Department, we will have the ability to examine the issue in a more joined-up manner. On the specific case, I will ask the Minister of State to engage and see what can be done on the health side.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> To respond to Deputy Lahart, I take on board everything he said and thank him for his comments directed at me and the Minister of State. We have to recognise the nimbleness of childcare professionals and providers. The expert funding model will give us significant guidance as to how we can best use the increased State investment to get the best outcomes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_376">I want to raise a very important issue from my constituency of Donegal, namely, the plight of the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation, which is based in Donegal town and serves south County Donegal, and iCARE, based on the Inishowen Peninsula. Both organisations have provided a tremendous service to children and young people with disabilities and their families for about 20 years. For 18 years, they did not have any fixed financial support from the State. There was a campaign in Donegal to change that, and two years ago they were allocated €36,000 per annum. That equates to one quarter of the real needs identified by the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation and about one third of the needs of iCARE. Their representatives met Ministers with responsibility for health and disabilities in the previous Government. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for meeting them last year and I understand she is trying to resolve the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The issue is urgent. The Minister will be aware that during the pandemic, the usual supports from the statutory services have not been there. iCARE and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation are assuming the burden. I think we will all agree it was harrowing to read the recent correspondence. I urge the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure that the services get the necessary funding. The HSE and other statutory services refer young people and children with disabilities and their families to these community services.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I thank the Deputy for bringing up this issue. He is correct in saying I met with iCARE and Bluestack Special Needs Foundation last November. As we know, at the moment, the HSE's operational plans are being put together. I have liaised directly with Dr. Cathal Morgan from the HSE on this in the last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> These organisations do positive and fantastic work right across the whole county of Donegal and provide a service for more than 400 families. The Deputy is correct; the HSE refers to them. In conjunction with the HSE in County Donegal, we are trying to put in place a solution that will continue to recognise the good work done by iCARE and Bluestack Special Needs Foundation. That, hopefully, will work out positively.</p>

          <p eId="para_380">I thank the Minister of State and appreciate her response. As per meetings with previous Ministers, the difficulty has been that, unfortunately, the HSE in County Donegal is continuing to take up the financial flack. Therefore, it will be necessary for central government to release funding to assist with this.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">I have two questions for the Minister. Perhaps he can answer the first one and then come back to me. I want first to acknowledge the huge work done by those in the early years sector. They have operated selflessly over the course of the pandemic and despite all the challenges have really stepped up. I thank them for that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> I know that when the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, was set up initially, a real effort was made by the Minister and the Department to ensure it worked for the early years sector and provided that continuity between the providers and staff. Unfortunately, I do not think this worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I am not sure if the Minister has seen the latest figures I received from the Department of Finance. On 21 December 2020, 1,992 childcare workers were on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. That number has since risen to 4,175. Those latest figures were from 1 February so there has been a 110% increase in the number of childcare workers who are receiving the PUP. Therefore, a significant number of childcare providers are not availing of the EWSS scheme. The downside of that is those staff will lose part of their entitlements, such as holidays and PRSI. It also means, however, that there will be a disconnection and there will not be continuity between the provider and the staff. That continuity is important for the providers but also for the children who will want to see the same faces when they go back into crèche.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Is the Minister aware of that issue? Has he investigated it? Will he look at the EWSS and reform it to ensure he can fix whatever is not working with us and not working for providers and the staff themselves? We should not be left in a situation where we have many highly qualified staff who are now on the PUP and do not have that continuity back to their employer.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">The maintenance of staff and of childcare professionals in employment is an absolute key priority for me. I was aware in January that creeping numbers of staff were claiming the PUP. Therefore, one of the conditions we have put in place with the enhanced funding measures, which will come in from 5 February, is the maintenance of staff on the payroll. That was certainly a key demand of SIPTU in our engagement with it on the childcare advisory council. That condition has been put into the new contract. To be able to avail of the remaining 30% of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, payments and the Covid-19 operating support payment, childcare providers must sign up to the new contract, which includes the maintenance of staff. That measure is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The policy and law around the EWSS is a matter for the Department of Finance. I am doing what I can within my Department, however, and doing it quickly to make sure we can maintain staff in employment because of the disadvantages that occur if they end up losing their position, as the Deputy has outlined, even if it is for a short period of time.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I thank the Minister for that response. It would be good if there was some way of retrospectively dealing with it because there has obviously been a severing of relationships with some staff and their employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> While I have the Minister here, I will mention a separate matter because it is of real urgency. I refer to the destruction of the 550 files, that is, the testimonials from the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation and the fact that the commission will be wrapped up on 28 February. We must investigate and see how those files were destroyed. We must ask why survivors did not give their consent for those files to be destroyed and ascertain how it was allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Will the Minister extend the remit and time period for the commission rather than it finishing up on 28 February? We need it to hand over the documentation it has in its possession on 28 February, as per the legislation brought in by the Minister in October. We need the commission to remain in operation for another year to enable survivors' questions to be asked and answered regarding the documentation.</p>

          <p eId="para_392"> In the context of the deletion of these tapes, at the moment we are in the process - I must be clear that it is a process - of looking particularly at Article 16 of GDPR on the right to rectification, and gaining an understanding of what the consequences of that will be for my Department when the archive transfers to us on 28 February.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">That is perfect, a Cheann Comhairle. I will perhaps get a written reply if that is okay. Early learning and childcare is important to children and families across the country and these services have done an incredible job throughout the pandemic. I wish to thank our front-line workers, without whose efforts these supports would not be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Childcare is something we should all care about. If we have appropriate childcare, society can function. Some 7,000 front-line workers needed childcare last month and their availability for work was impacted by the lack of options for childcare. It would be helpful even if restricted childcare services were open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> It is welcome that those who cannot attend work due to childminding responsibilities are able to claim their PUP. The funding to enable providers to reimburse parents who do not take up the service and help support them to retain staff and reopen as normal once restrictions are lifted is welcome. It does not solve our childcare issues, however. School is not childcare. It is, however, care for children who are not in the care of their parents or guardian. More options must be in place for those adults to return to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> While we are beginning to stagger a return to education next month, we need to know if primary schools will be prioritised. Is the ECCE scheme going to be back on stream? While financial support is welcome, it does not enrich a child or provide respite for exhausted and worn-out parents and caregivers. Our model of childcare provision needs serious reflection. We need to look at how provisions by our European neighbours have been made throughout this pandemic. Everyone wants to know when the full option of childcare is coming back including primary schools, crèches and ECCE schemes as well as youth programmes for teenagers.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> While I welcome the reopening of special education and the ongoing work to achieve this, I was alarmed to read that in the few hours after the announcement, applications for the few additional educational needs, AEN, classes were oversubscribed by two to one. Most of these children are in mainstream schools because the facilities for them are just not there. I would like a written answer on this. What are we doing for these children?</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> It is most welcome that special needs assistants, SNAs, will now be prioritised for vaccines because they are returning to schools. Early years workers have been working in direct contact with children since January, without adequate personal protective equipment, PPE, and social distance supports because of the nature of the work. When will they be prioritised for their vaccination? I listened to the Minister a minute ago when he said he was working with the HSE. I welcome that; it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Lastly, €10.41 for a childcare worker is not enough. It is seriously not enough. I bet the Minister that every parent who is at home and homeschooling at the moment will agree with me. I ask the Minister to look at it because this needs to be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">It is unacceptable for a childcare worker to only receive €10.41 per hour.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">As the Minister knows, I have quite an expressed interest in this area, not only as a parent of preschool children but also as someone who is married to a Montessori teacher. In advance of this session I received dozens of questions, which I will submit to the Minister in writing, and I thank him for already answering some of them when questioned by other Deputies. With the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence, I am going to ask a series of short questions and hopefully I will be able to leave about a minute for the Minister to address them. If the time goes over, of course I will give way.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> With respect to childcare providers, will the Minister commit to simplifying the system for drawing down supports, bearing in mind that most of these services are single person-operated? Will the Minister commit to ensuring that any future announcements will not be made on a Friday evening, after hours, giving providers just the weekend to prepare? Will the Minister commit to ensuring that proper PPE is provided to all early years and early school providers? Will the Minister commit to looking at a new VAT recovery system for childcare providers, bearing in mind that while childcare is VAT exempt, the heating, maintenance and so much else are not?</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> From the perspective of parents such as myself, can the Minister provide clarity - and this may have to be done in writing - on fees? Parents are still paying fees even though they cannot access the service. They are being required to pay holding fees for places that have not been drawn down or for after-school places. This is providing quite a bit of frustration and confusion and that feeds into the issue that there is a chronic lack of places, not just in our constituencies but across the country, particularly for younger children. Drawing on what Deputy Murnane O'Connor said, is it the Minister's intention to reopen the ECCE scheme at the same time as national schools are reopened, whenever that may be?</p>

          <p eId="para_405">There are a range of questions there. I wish to reopen the ECCE scheme as quickly as we can. We continue to look at that and to make preparations for its reopening. It will be linked to the wider reopening of the primary education sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">I commend the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on the excellent work they are doing in respect of childcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> The pandemic has underlined the fact that childcare is fundamentally important to the operation of our economy. Prior to this, people have looked at childcare as though it is the responsibility of an individual or an individual couple and a difficulty for them in their lives. However, the pandemic has shown that it is crucial to the operation of our economy. I agreed with Deputy Lahart when he said earlier that the State probably needs to get more involved and get more of a return on its investment in childcare. We need to look again at what community facilities are available that are owned by the State. National schools and the lands beside them seem like an obvious example of that. The State can provide space for childcare in such facilities into the future. That is something we have to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> The most significant step that can be taken by the Government in order to return some normality to childcare is the reopening of primary and secondary schools. Many parents who have kids in childcare also have children in school and the fact that the schools are not open is making this lockdown much more difficult than the previous one. I am fully aware that there are issues in respect of public health that have to be considered and that the safety of teachers has to be considered. I wish to echo and repeat - and I do not expect the Minister or the Minister of State to respond to this - what the then acting Chief Medical Officer said in a letter to parents on 31 August last in advance of the opening of schools. He said that the sustained closure of schools was having "very real harm" on children. That is something the Minister needs to take into account and bring to the Cabinet table. There are balancing issues here in terms of public health but when we have a statement from the then acting Chief Medical Officer that "very real harm" was being done to our children as a result of the sustained closure of schools, we need to act upon that. Hopefully we will be able to get that conversation going in the near future. I welcome the fact that in recent days, it was announced that schools in Scotland will be reopening later in February. I would hope to see the same thing happening here because we cannot allow damage to be inflicted on our children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denise Mitchell<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_411">The last year has been difficult for all children, with schools closing, sports being cancelled and all the other activities that children do grinding to a halt. The Child Care Law Reporting Project has stated that already vulnerable children have been made more vulnerable by the coronavirus pandemic. It said that some children were so severely neglected that they had to be hospitalised. The coronavirus has exposed the State's failings. Children received support, security, welfare and nutrition in school and in other settings that in some cases was not available at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I have huge concern about these children and the situations they are in. In situations where the teacher, youth worker or sport coach was looking out for at-risk children, who is keeping an eye on them now? I recently received a response to a parliamentary question which stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_413">From June 2020 to end of December 2020... a total of 100 social workers left the Agency of whom 90 resigned and 10 retired. An additional 7 social workers commenced a career break.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The cracks are there so who is filling them?</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Child poverty was there before Covid-19, it has gotten worse during Covid-19 for some children and it will be there after Covid-19. Warm meals in schools and in other places filled the gaps but these children are missing that now. My party, Sinn Féin, has solutions. We put down a number of motions during this term and the last term to address poverty for children and for wider society. Just yesterday, the Government advised that it would not be supporting a motion to increase fuel allowance, with Met Éireann advising that a deep cold spell and significant snow will be in Ireland in the coming days. I advise the Government to revisit this position for all of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> While I welcome the gradual reopening of special schools and wider services for children with disabilities, we have to recognise the particular difficulties that Covid-19 caused for these children and for their families. The regression and the lack of structure and familiar settings for children and the lack of respite for most parents who are full-time family carers will leave a deep and lasting impact. We are where we are now and we must learn from those mistakes. We must make sure that above all, this will be the last lockdown for these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I also want to briefly touch on the childcare sector. I recently received another parliamentary question response which told me that 192 early years childcare providers closed their doors for good between March and December 2020. We need to make sure there are no more closures because this will have a big impact on access and affordability for families and children.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_418">I have two sets of questions, the first on the disrespect shown to childcare workers by the Government and the second on the lack of supports for parents during this pandemic, including the proposal we have brought forward for paid childcare for working parents. The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated again just how essential childcare and childcare workers are. It is worth noting that over 90% of childcare workers are women. The Government and the Department have completely failed to support either parents or those childcare workers during this pandemic. They have been full of praise and claps but have failed to put their money where their mouths are.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> SIPTU carried out a survey in the last month which found that 89% of childcare workers disagreed with the statement: "Early Years Professionals have been valued as frontline workers by government during the pandemic."</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Is it any wonder that they feel undervalued when childcare is the lowest paid sector of the economy, when 90% of childcare workers say they struggle to make ends meet, when 88% of childcare workers earn less than €12.30 an hour with an average wage of just under €11.50 an hour, and where almost 12 months into a pandemic, in a front-line job, working in a situation where social distancing is often impossible, 77% of childcare workers are not entitled to any sick pay from their employer? The positivity rate of mass testing in childcare is running at 10% compared to 6.6% generally and there have been 42 outbreaks in childcare facilities in the past two weeks, and yet the Government will not even provide workers with proper sick pay or a living wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> It seems a long time ago, but it was this time last year that 30,000 childcare workers took to the streets to demand improved wages and conditions. They had the left's support then. They have it now. They will be protesting again online this Friday. They and I are looking for a commitment from the Minister to introduce a living wage of at least €15 an hour for childcare workers, to commit to making the massive investment in State funding needed to pay childcare workers properly as the essential public servants that they are, and to make free public childcare available to all parents who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> The other question I have relates to the situation of many parents. They are at this stage at their wits' end trying to juggle work and childcare during the lockdown with no support from the State. They are expected to double job - holding down the regular work while also home-schooling - and many are simply not able to do it. Last week, I questioned the Minister for Social Protection about the supports available and was told the answer from her Department is to give up one's job and to go on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. The Minister also passed the buck to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, stating that parental leave is his responsibility. At present, in Ireland, there is zero entitlement to paid leave for parents after one's child reaches the age of one and even when the new entitlement to parents' leave is finally brought in, any entitlement to paid leave for parents will end at the child's grand old age of two. Other countries across Europe have brought in new entitlements to paid childcare leave from work during the pandemic. Does the Minister not agree that it is about time that we did the same? Germany, for example, introduced an extra ten days' paid leave per parent to enable them to mind children at home because of Covid measures, such as school closures, illness or self-isolation. Austria, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia have all introduced paid leave for parents with children. There are similar measures in France. Once again, it is women who are hardest hit by this, shouldering the bulk of the childcare work. What is the Minister doing to help parents, especially mothers, remain in the workforce and assist them with their additional childcare responsibilities during Covid? Will the Minister agree with our Bill? Will he agree to give parents a break and introduce a special Covid parental or childcare benefit, as in Germany and other EU countries?</p>

          <p eId="para_423">I thank Deputy Paul Murphy. I disagree with the Deputy's statement that we have not supported childcare workers during this period. The employment wage supplement scheme, EWSS, has been a very significant investment by the State in supporting the wages and the position of childcare professionals. The childcare profession is the only profession which had a sector-wide exemption, which I negotiated. I did so because I understand the importance of childcare professionals to our children and to our economy, but also because I understand the poor wages that childcare professionals have experienced over the past number of years. As I stated in my introductionary speech and in speaking to other Deputies, the focus on the level of pay and resolving that through the joint labour committee, JLC, process which I have worked closely on with both Childhood Services Ireland and SIPTU, will bring forward proposals that, I believe, can address the very low levels of pay that we must address.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">I would also disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy who spoke before me. I believe that both the Minister and the Minister of State have done their level best to address many of the concerns in the childcare sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I am a parent of two children under two. I will appreciate much more the work that childcare workers do and, I suppose, the impact that it has on our pockets. As Deputies Lahart and Jim O'Callaghan mentioned earlier, it is becoming like a second mortgage. I suppose I am beginning to experience that for myself.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The steps Government has taken need to be acknowledged. Some 80% of payroll costs and 50% of operational costs for the vast majority of these facilities have been covered because of the supports that both the Minister and the Minister of State have introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I have three distinct queries or questions, and I was wondering if the Minister could comment. The first relates to reimbursements. I have come across some cases in childcare facilities where I wonder whether it is a question of must there be a reimbursement or should there be a reimbursement. The importance around that language is that I am coming across some facilities where that reimbursement is not forthcoming or there seems to be some kind of confusion around it. It is merely to clarify whether it must or should be reimbursed.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The second question is in regard to pregnant crèche workers. According to the guidelines, "Pregnant teachers and SNAs are to work from home as part of these temporary arrangements while advice for pregnant education sector staff is developed by occupational and public health doctors." Could the Minister explain why that distinction is there? What is the difference between a teacher and an SNA being allowed, if they are pregnant, to work from home as opposed to somebody working in the childcare sector? It is important that that distinction be explained.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> My final question is regarding the JLC. I welcome the Minister's comments today that it is progressing. The Minister cannot reveal too much, but if he has anything else that he can elaborate on in terms of how that process will unfold, I would appreciate it.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_431">I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his comments. I am aware that we always have more to do in this sector, particularly on the issue of pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> As regards reimbursements, for the period of 1 January to 5 February we did not have any legal requirements. We did not have a new contract in place with childcare providers and we could not compel reimbursements. During that period, we requested that childcare providers make a reimbursement. For the next period, the period of 5 February to 1 March, if childcare providers want to avail of the enhanced package of funding they must sign a new contract including a commitment to a mandatory reimbursement. They do not have to sign up to that new contract but if they want to avail of the enhanced funding, they must sign up to it and make the reimbursement.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> The JLC process is one that I am confident will be able to deliver a significant increase in the wages of childcare professionals. It will involve SIPTU. It will involve Childhood Services Ireland. I will receive more detail, hopefully, later on in the week. I will let Deputies know about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> On the issue of the guidance as regards childcare professionals who are pregnant, all the information our Department uses is based on public health guidance from the Department, from the HSE. I might come back to the Deputy in writing, specifically, on that, so that he has a clear understanding.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_438">Till it's gone ...</p>
          <p eId="para_439">That is certainly true of the case of childcare where we realised during the restrictions that have been imposed in Covid just how important childcare, early childhood education and support are. I refer to the social interaction but also the early start that many children, particularly children from disadvantaged areas, are missing at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> The State has been slow to respond to this. I suppose it is not surprising, given that the Constitution still states that the place of a woman is in the home. We have a lot of ground to make up. I suppose it is understandable that much of the focus in trying to make up that ground has been on standards, enforcement and inspection. There are as many as three bodies charged with that responsibility. That can only get one so far. The real challenge here is how we face up to the problems, that, indeed, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, pointed out, such as high staff turnover, no time for planning and development of programmes, and not being able to hang on to people, particularly highly qualified people, in the sector. These are real issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> It amazes me, having spent much of my time in the enterprise sector, how a similar number, approximately 4,000, of exporting companies have the support of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, IDA Ireland and numerous others helping them develop their programme and we have none for a sector that is dealing with 200,000 of our most precious asset for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">When will the Minister table draft proposals for the child development agency, which will be crucial in developing leadership, the potential for innovation and better approaches to the Early Start programme and early intervention, a transition from early childhood education to primary school and placements for trainees? There is considerable potential in this regard and I look forward to the Minister's proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">I have a four-year-old son who attends our local preschool. I value the work that Ms Catherine Hickey, Ms Clara O'Dwyer - I believe they might be watching us - and others do.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> I wish to make a few points briefly. Frustratingly, my time is limited. Regarding the access and inclusion model, AIM, scheme, there are too many children in preschool who need to be referred to CAMHS for an assessment after an alarm bell rings only for that assessment not to happen before the child enters primary school. I saw this happening too often as a primary school teacher. A child could be six or seven years of age before an appropriate assessment and therapeutic practices are put in place even though flags were raised when the child was three or four years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The 38-week contract is unfair to staff in the early childhood sector. They must sign on despite many being educated to degree level. I attended Mary Immaculate College. When I went into a primary teacher lecture hall there, they went into a lecture hall across the way. The pay grades and work conditions are incomparable. There are too many regulatory bodies - Pobal, the Department of Education, Tusla and the HSE. Many childcare staff have no pensions on top of the old age pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Will the Minister respond to some of these points briefly, please?</p>

          <p eId="para_450">I take on board the Deputy's point about the AIM scheme. We have put additional funding into it this year because it has been successful, but there is a lack of joined-up thinking. We hope that the transfer of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the area of disability issues to my Department will give us the opportunity to focus on children and consider disability throughout all life stages. We can do much better in terms of joined-up thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The Deputy rightly identified the issue of pay. A joint labour committee, JLC, gives us an opportunity to enhance pay in this sector. I will do whatever I can to support the work of bringing together a JLC process.</p>

          <from>Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_452">I wish to raise with the Minister the precarious situation of the early years and childcare sector. We all know the great work being done by people in the sector and how important that is to everyone in society. Unfortunately, some vital childcare facilities in my constituency of County Clare had to close their doors in 2020. It was disheartening to hear the news as it came in and it is disappointing to know that they will have no opportunity to reopen. Many others are struggling to keep their businesses afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Childcare and early years professionals are some of the lowest paid in the wider educational sector and are now back at work with little or no protection. Ireland is at the bottom of the European league in terms of childcare investment. Budget 2021 did nothing to address that, which was disappointing. This disappointment was felt by all staff members and operators in the sector. The majority of the sector's employees do not get sick pay and earn less than the living wage. It remains difficult to attract prospective employees, which leaves the sector in a difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> In recent weeks, I have received emails from many concerned professionals in the sector who feel they have been treated differently than the wider educational sector in terms of a lack of personal protective equipment, PPE. The most pressing issue being raised with me is the fact that workers in the childcare and early years profession have been placed 11th on the vaccination priority list. However, I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard. Early years educators and childcare staff are essential front-line workers. They are not required to wear face masks and they cannot practise social distancing despite that being common sense. This makes them vulnerable in their line of work. Those with underlying health conditions or who have family members with such conditions still have go to work. I urge the Minister to fight for these workers and have their place on the priority list reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I wish to raise a few issues on the back of several recent announcements about the reopening of special education. Parents like me have been at home and have been the only platform, as it were, from which our children can seek answers and gain a better understanding of what is happening in society. We are doing our best to protect them, but we have had difficult conversations with them, and we are still having difficult conversations with them, and we have tried to find ways of explaining what is happening to them. It is difficult for parents as well as other children in the family to watch the regression of a child in need and see a lack of support and therapy. I will take this opportunity to ask the Minister to review the local supports and services that are in place for children with special needs. They have gone a long time without speech and language therapy, for example.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">I welcome the Minister's statement and the measures he has announced in recent weeks. I welcome the announcement of youth funding of €67 million for 2021. In particular, I welcome the announcement of €968,490 for the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board. However, this allocation seems low compared with allocations in other areas. Will the Minister clarify the rationale for the difference in allocations to various education and training boards? I welcome the announcement of €12 million for national youth organisations and €2.25 million for the local youth club grant scheme. Although I welcome these announcements, it is my strong belief that the funds will not go far enough. In fact, the sums mentioned are inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> As the Minister knows, I have constantly spoken out about mental health issues, in particular those facing our younger generation. Today's world places significant pressure on the younger generation and they need support now more than ever. The Covid pandemic has put them under further pressure. They have effectively been cooped up for the past 12 months and it is clear that this has caused serious mental health issues. As chairman of the GAA's Louth County Board, I know from first-hand experience the issues being faced by the younger generation in these times. Organisations like the GAA and others can only do so much. Will the Minister examine the funding announcements he has made in recent weeks to determine whether more can be done? These organisations need more support in terms of funding. This is a matter that the Minister needs to re-examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Childcare is an issue for many parents, particularly with the country in another lockdown. I know from dealing with matters in my constituency that parents are at breaking point. They feel let down by the Government. In many cases, they are being forced to work from home while also looking after their children. It is not feasible for many. Childcare is available to essential workers, but thousands of people are being forced to work from home with no childcare supports at all because they are not deemed essential. I appreciate that there is no easy answer, but the Government needs to do more for these workers. I know from speaking to special needs assistants that their childcare needs are forgotten about. When schools were to reopen in January, they had difficulty accessing childcare. School staff are now being advised to take parental leave or unpaid leave should they be unable to secure suitable childcare when schools reopen. That is wrong. School staff should be treated as essential workers when schools reopen. Will the Minister reconsider this matter? A simple solution would be to classify school staff as essential workers and give them the same supports as those already classified as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Another suggestion I would like to make is that all special education needs staff should get vaccinated as a matter of urgency. They often deal with children on a one-to-one basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Unfortunately, in many cases, they lack proper personal protective equipment. Will the Minister confirm whether this has been discussed at Cabinet? If not, will he give a commitment that he will bring it to his Cabinet colleagues? As I have stated, I have on numerous occasions spoken in the House about the mental health challenges faced by the younger generation. The lockdown has compounded the problem. If we look at what has happened, schools, community services, primary care, early year settings and even the homes of extended family and friends are no longer accessible to the younger generation. Can the Minister just imagine the effect this is having on them? They are without normal day-to-day interaction with their extended families. Their social gatherings are all but gone and unavailable, whether it be the local GAA club, soccer club or youth club. I fear what the long-term effects of this will be. I understand completely that we are living in unprecedented times but, at the same time, is the right thing to do to shut off the support chain completely for this generation?</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Another aspect of the lockdown is the very worrying fact that Tusla has reported a significant drop in the number of children being referred while schools are closed. In the second week of January, the number of referrals dipped to 990 from the average of 1,500 a week. I am deeply concerned about this. I do not believe for one minute the actual number who need referral has reduced but that we are, in fact, missing upwards of 600 referrals a week. These are for the most part very vulnerable children who need support now. We need more action to address this. I know additional funding has been allocated to Tusla but it is obviously not enough. Is it simply the case that with schools being closed we will miss 600 weekly referrals to Tusla? This is not acceptable and we must address it now. I would like to hear the views of the Minister on this and what proposals he intends to introduce to address this serious and immediate problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I welcome the recent announcement of additional funding by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, but I also want to make the point that it is not enough in these difficult times. I would also like to ask the Minister for support to classify school staff as essential workers so they can access childcare. Will the Minister also clarify the rationale in the allocation of funds to the education and training boards? Will the Minister support me in calling for additional support for parents who are now forced to work from home while, at the same time, having to provide childcare in the home? Will the Minister support me in my request that all school staff get the Covid vaccination before schools are reopened? Will the Minister comment on the fact that referrals to Tusla have dropped dramatically from 1,500 to 990 per week since schools were forced to close due to the lockdown?</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I thank the Deputy. On the issue of the allocation to Meath and Louth Education and Training Board I will correspond in writing to him and give the rationale behind it. We secured a €5 million increase in funding for the youth services sector, which is the biggest increase in the past decade so it was very substantial. I will always be looking to put more money into that sector but we should acknowledge it was a significant increase. Certainly the youth groups to which I have spoken see the extra use to which the money can go.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> With regard to Tusla referrals, Tusla has identified vulnerable children during the lockdown as one of the core groups it is focused on. I have engaged with the CEO of Tusla on this particular issue and I am confident it will continue to focus on these vulnerable children. I am aware of the fact that with schools closed the extra vigilance that teachers and special needs assistants provide with regard to vulnerable children is not there. Tusla will step up and seek to bridge this gap.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">I am glad to have this opportunity to make a few points on childcare. With regard to the systems and structures review I caution against any change to the county childcare committees, which have been serving us very well. More resourcing and supports for these structures is a better way to go rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. I was concerned when the Minister took office that this was a suggestion, and I hope it is one he will suppress because it is a good structure. It is one that can work and, with the proper resources, can work much better.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The next issue I want to raise is that of remuneration. We have many professionals working in the childcare sector but we choose not to acknowledge this. What we have, in effect, are many people with masters degrees, fourth level education and level 9 qualifications working for €12 an hour who, during the summer, are forced to sign on and look for other jobs. This is not commensurate with the contribution they make. Other Members have said that the Covid crisis underpinned our level of dependency on, and the importance and critical nature of, the childcare sector and what it does for us. We also choose at times to acknowledge the educational contribution it makes but then at other times we do not. There clearly is a huge educational and development side to early years care and we do not acknowledge this. For example, a private sector crêche has to pay commercial rates but a school does not. This is something I have mentioned many times before and it is something the Minister will have to petition his colleagues in government around the Cabinet table to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> During the Covid crisis we have to ensure the employment wage subsidy scheme is available to the end of the year, until such time as we have herd immunity through wholesale vaccination throughout the country. I made this point to the Minister for Finance yesterday. We need this support. While I acknowledge some additional supports that were put in place, in terms of investment when Katherine Zappone was in office, we need substantially more, particularly on the capital side. We will need a rolling capital programme to support this sector if we are going to give it what it deserves. In essence, this is proper recognition for the qualifications and professionalism of those working in the sector with appropriate remuneration. It is simply miserly what they are expected to work for measured against the contribution they are making.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> There is also the issue with regard to acknowledging the educational and developmental role for all of our children. The Minister must maintain the county childcare committee structure as the delivery agent. He must also secure from the Minister for Finance a rolling appropriate capital budget that supports the sector throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I very much hope the Minister will take these matters on board because, as with some other aspects of our society, the childcare area is hugely overlooked and undersupported. I do not doubt the Minister's personal commitment to remedy these matters but I hope he can embrace the couple of points I am putting forward. I am not looking for a response today and the Minister can drop me a note in writing. I do not want to eat into my colleague's time. I very much hope the Minister will make his mark in highlighting these three or four issues I have put forward today and that we will be able to identify some tangible actions over the coming months.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_470">I welcome the opportunity to put a few points to the Minister and perhaps he will respond in writing. I would like to articulate the issues and concerns I have. The people running childcare facilities throughout the country have to be commended for the amount of work they are doing. As a society, we have to acknowledge and accept that this is the very foundation on which the State will be run. We are starting with childcare facilities and the various schemes being run for very young people in their very formative years. We should compliment all those who work in the sector. As a State we have to be very careful to ensure they are properly rewarded and properly remunerated and that the services they give are properly accepted by the Government, the State and society as a whole. As a society we owe them a great debt of gratitude for the work they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Over the pandemic, we have seen many challenges and issues in the childcare sector. It has shone a spotlight on the challenges with regard to the orderly running of essential services in society. Therein lies the problem with which we have to grapple and look at. I want to raise a number of issues. Under the programme for Government, disability services are being moved to the Minister's Department from the Department of Health. How is this planning going? When is the move likely to take place? When will the memorandums be done? We are now seven, if not eight, months into the Government and we want to ensure this body of work promised in the programme for Government is completed because there is so much to be done in the disability sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Essentially, for those in the disability sector, we do not want bureaucracy to hold up the work that needs to be done. In questions I have put to the Department of Health again this week in regard to waiting lists for services for people with disabilities and assessment of needs, the replies showed up the chronic need for staff recruitment and for proper, thought-out practice. Young people are not getting the services they need and are not getting assessments of need. While people are completely dependent on the public service for occupational therapy or speech therapy, it is non-existent. We have to accept that right here and now, today, 4 February, it is non-existent. We are failing those kids who need those therapies. We have seen many families going private and using whatever available finances they have. We have to ensure this is highlighted at every level, that it is accepted by Government Departments and agencies, and that that challenge is met head-on.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> The latest figures again show that the waiting lists are utterly unacceptable. I challenge the Minister to come back to me on when the transfer of powers will take place and how urgently the Government is going to tackle the waiting list issue immediately after that takes place. It is a fundamental issue. It will continue the good work of the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in the sector. I look forward to further engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> As we are on the issue of disability, there is a huge crisis in regard to school transport, the way school transport is being carried out by the State and the inadequacies that are being thrown up on a daily basis for kids who need transport. I will come back to that in further debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">It is claimed that NPHET and the Government deem schools safe to reopen. Therefore, why has it taken so long to get special education schools open? We welcome the decision by the Government, or the agreement in principle, to reopen schools on Thursday, 11 February, with a 50% student attendance. Special classes in other schools are to open on 22 February. However, what level of consultation has taken place with the unions, parents and teachers around these announcements?</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> While I am talking about the reopening of schools, leaving certificate and junior certificate students are mentally drained from the lack of clarity from this Government. The main message from students is to put a predictive grades system in place for the leaving certificate and, if students are unable to use this, to allow them the choice of sitting the leaving certificate. I have voiced these concerns numerous times. It is time decisions were made. I urge the Minister to share this with all of Ireland's students because, even though he is not the Minister for Education, he is the Minister with responsibility for children. The junior certificate students seem to be forgotten in all of this, so let us not forget them. They are only 14 or 15 years old. These children have no idea what exams they will be doing, when they will be doing their mock exams or what is happening with their classroom-based assessments, CBAs.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> It is time decisions were made. We are not just talking about their education; we are talking about their mental health also. Many leading front-line mental health professionals have reported there is a mental health tsunami coming when Covid-19 recedes. Ireland's mental health system is not prepared for such a crisis, and this is mainly because the Irish system was in crisis mode long before the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Cork South-West has such a shocking broadband service, from Adrigole to Kilmacsimon and right throughout west Cork, that these leaving certificate and junior certificate students cannot have remote access. One family, and there are many others, cannot even get mobile phone coverage in their own house so the students there cannot even use their own data. Can a plan can be put in place for such disadvantaged students to go into their schools and access the school Wi-Fi to learn, or even to go to their local community centres? I met several parents by phone at my office yesterday, and a mother told me she had to pick and choose from her five children who could access the Wi-Fi in the house as it is too slow for all the children to use. This is the case for many families. It is all very well to say children can learn remotely. However, in practice, in rural Ireland they are far more disadvantaged, and not alone for learning, as this is the only way our young people have to contact their friends and peers.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">The Minister will accept that finding solutions to the problem of childcare in the midst of a pandemic is no easy task. That difficulty was compounded by the fact the early years sector in particular, prior to the pandemic, felt it was unheard and disrespected, and that its solutions were only nominally accepted. Recently, I participated in a Zoom call with SIPTU and the early years sector. The message was very clear. This is a sector full of hope but it is being continually let down.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The Minister will be aware SIPTU recently launched its early years professionals survey. The survey shows that 67% of early years educators earn below the living wage of €12.30 per hour and 90% of all professionals struggle to make ends meet. Sick pay, maternity pay, pensions and other basic conditions are virtually non-existent. Some 38% of early years professionals are actively looking for a job outside the sector, and this rises to 42% of room leaders, where most graduates are employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> From what I understand, SIPTU is calling for the establishment of a joint labour committee, as promised in the programme for Government, and this would allow the introduction of an early years pay scale. What we also need is for the small-scale early childcare providers to be supported with financial supports and measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The other issue I want to raise is that of waiting lists in Laois and Offaly for occupational therapy and speech therapy. I have raised the issue several times because children with special needs are really suffering. In Laois-Offaly currently, 2,014 children are waiting for occupational therapy and 1,453 children are waiting for speech therapy. I have already put forward a possible solution. Given there are regions that do not have the same backlogs as Laois-Offaly, could the staff from those regions be redeployed until the backlog of children is cleared in Laois-Offaly? This is a pragmatic solution and while recruitment is ongoing, I think it is a fair solution. I ask the Government to take that on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">I ask the Minister to consider an extension of carer’s leave for family carers who find themselves unable to return to work because of continuing care needs during the pandemic. There are many reasons we need to extend carer’s leave for now. Children with special needs have been unable to return to school and when they do, many will return on a phased basis. I congratulate all involved in ensuring the continuation of day services but, for many people, the hours are reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> In these instances, family carers have to fill the gap and many will need an extension of carer’s leave. If the cared-for person has been unable to secure a replacement care package because of staff shortages or the fact that workers do not want to enter family homes, that family carer needs an extension of carer's leave. If the person who is cared for is especially vulnerable and is waiting for vaccination, family carers need an extension of carer’s leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> The precedent has rightly been set by the Government for new parents on maternity leave. It is vital that a similar arrangement would be made available to family carers at the end of their two years of leave. The numbers are limited to a maximum of about 3,700 and the extension of this leave would be a strong signal that the work and commitment of family carers is valued by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> My second point, which has been raised by many Deputies, is that there were staggering figures from a recent SIPTU survey of 2,000 childcare professionals, which clearly illustrates the extreme financial insecurity of many in this sector. Almost 70% are earning less than €12.30 an hour. They must at the very least be entitled to a living wage of €15. Many have no sick pay, no maternity leave or no pension. Is it any wonder so many are looking elsewhere for jobs?</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I am pleased the Minister is discussing pay and conditions with SIPTU and that Dr. Duffy is compiling a report. However, this report must be followed by action. The Minister said there would be no lack of speed in implementation. Many in this House, including myself, will hold him to account for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">As I have told the Minister many times, he has inherited a situation. He is more than aware that a year ago tomorrow, that childare workers went out on protest about pay and conditions. He is fully aware that of the approximately 26,882 childcare staff, 98% are female. That says a lot about how we treat women and their conditions for work in this country in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I wish to raise two issues. It is important to pay tribute to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. Last June, it produced a document and its key messages are worth looking at. I acknowledge the amount of money that has gone into the sector over a particular period and that it is multiples of a hundred. Notwithstanding that, what we need is a new model of public childcare. The Library and Research Service research showed that "Ireland has the highest level of private provision of early childhood care and education in the OECD with relatively low Government investment, low wages and high fees for consumers". It is a no-win for everybody. It notes that "the available research has identified positive outcomes for public early childcare" and that "the evidence base also indicates that in public provision countries childcare tends to be more affordable, accessible, and of higher quality than in private provision countries". The key challenge is to have a new model and for this Government to actually learn from the pandemic. I do not expect the Government to get things right in the middle of a pandemic - it is difficult - but to learn from it and from the crisis that the pandemic landed on and let us have a different public provision of childcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Different groups were set up and an interdepartmental group to look at this. What stage are they at? The Minister will not have time to answer this but I would appreciate a reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> I will use my remaining 20 seconds to raise the Commission of Investigation into the Mother and Baby Homes. Will the Minister please return with clarification as quickly as possible on the destruction on the recorded evidence. Is it possible to retrieve it? Do we need legislation to extend the time to get an explanation and to get the evidence? At the very least, can we have clarification?</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I thank the Deputies for the support they have expressed for this important Bill. The contributions to the points that have been raised have been very useful and I am grateful for the consideration they have given to it. While this is a relatively short and technical Bill, the importance of this area should not be underestimated. These crimes are not victimless, we all pay for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Many Deputies raised questions on enforcement resources. I fully agree that legislation cannot be effective unless there are resources to back it up. Tackling economic crime and white-collar crime is a priority for this Government, and for An Garda Síochána. Deputies will be will be aware that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, published the findings of the Hamilton review group on 3 December 2020. As she pointed out, these crimes damage our economy. They breed cynicism in our society and are a threat to our international reputation. </p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The Department is leading a cross-government initiative to tackle these crimes and to ensure that all agencies have the resources they need. I note in particular that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB, is critical and competitions are currently under way to strengthen the staffing levels. Deputy Connolly, in particular, raised this matter. This investment in the GNECB will see the number of officers rise from 46 to 112, and there will also be a significant investment in ICT.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> As Deputies mentioned, measures led by the Tánaiste to overhaul the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, are also advancing with support of my Department. Several Deputies understandably raised the issue of delayed transposition of this directive. It is important to note that the vast majority of the requirements of the directive are already in place within Part 6 of the Act. This is a harmonisation measure rather than a set of completely new provisions. However, there were complex legal issues to consider particularly in respect of extraterritorial and corporate liability that required input from the Attorney General. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The Bill was published at the beginning of January 2020, but was delayed given the dissolution of the Dáil and, indeed, the other pressing matters that have been before the Oireachtas since then concerning Covid. We do take the obligations of EU membership very seriously. Since being appointed as Minister of State I have taken ownership of addressing transpositions that are overdue. To that end, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Decision on Supervision Measures) Act 2020 was enacted in November. We completed all Stages of the Money Laundering (Terrorist Financing) Bill and are on Committee Stage in the Seanad. We have completed Seanad Stages of the Bill before the House today and hope to have enacted it over the coming weeks. We have also published the counterfeiting Bill and have two particularly important Bills on the priority list due for publication by Easter, one on prisoner transfer and the other on people smuggling. Therefore, while I take the point raised by Deputies, we are making very substantial progress despite being in a situation in which parliamentary time is scarce due to Covid-19. I have a standing instruction to the Whip's office that we are ready to take any slot that we can to keep legislation moving as quickly as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Deputy Daly and others asked about the commencement of the Bill once it has been enacted. We intend to do this as soon as possible after signature, and we do not anticipate any delay arising. Deputies Howlin and Catherine Murphy asked regarding the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, and how it will co-operate with Irish authorities. We expect that the EPPO will be designated as a competent authority in the participating member states, and will make requests either itself or via national authorities under the applicable mutual legal assistance provisions under the European arrest warrant under freezing and confiscation provisions and so on. On a practical level, it will work with the gardaí and the Director of State Prosecution in investigating and prosecuting cross-border crimes. The directive envisages other measures like working together to develop strategic priorities and on staff exchanges and training provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I note Deputy Howlin's comments regarding the importance of ensuring that Ireland's common law tradition is respected after Brexit. I think this is a real issue and one that will become more and more pressing over time. As the Deputy's colleague, Senator Bacik, pointed out in the Seanad, there are very positive features of both common law and civil law systems, and it is not a case of one being superior over the other. There is much to be learned and shared between the systems. However, we will need to prioritise and resource our engagement on these issues to ensure the integrity of our system is respected. </p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I note also Deputy Howlin mentioned his Private Member's Bill on the proceeds of crime. This is being given very serious consideration by the Department and the view of the Attorney General has been requested. A different approach has been taken in this and other recent Bills in the terms of dual criminality. This reflects the evolution of international norms. I look forward to engaging further with the Deputy on this as the legal side of it is fully considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Deputies mentioned the figure €477 million. This figure originates from the Commission staff working paper impact assessment which accompanied the original protection of the European Union’s financial interests, PIF, proposal. To state the obvious, it is very difficult to estimate fraud totals. If we knew about every case, then it would be much easier to prevent. The Commission based its estimate on an analysis of illegal activities, affecting public funds across the Union as a whole, and to our knowledge, did not approach this estimate on a country-by-country basis. However, the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, publishes an annual report each year on the protection of the EU's financial interests, "The Fight against Fraud". The 31st report, published in September, showed that in 2019 detected fraud-related financial amounts declined from the previous year. Some 939 fraudulent irregularities were reported for a financial value of roughly less than half that of 2018, confirming an overall declining trend over the last five years. Detected non-fraudulent irregularities remained stable, but declined in value 88%. The annexes of this report provide figures by country in different categories. While it is evident that different countries adopt different standards for reporting, the share of the total in respect of Ireland is very low in respect of revenue and expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">We intend to keep the focus on tackling that.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> In respect of Deputy Naughten's amendment on pet theft, I thank the Members for their contributions. As I mentioned in my opening contribution, this is a very important issue for me and one I previously introduced as a Private Members' Bill. On one level it is correct to say that existing offences already apply to this crime and carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and the handling of stolen property, while a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property. Where trespass on property is involved, it becomes burglary and attracts a penalty of up to 14 years. The message needs to be got out that there are already tough penalties available. </p>
          <p eId="para_504"> When imposing sentences judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet. The emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and I believe is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I would accept that the offence is very broad. I have committed to examining the options here. I met with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, before Christmas. Contact is continuing at an official level.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> It is important to note that we are not simply looking at a legislative change. We are willing to consider such changes, and it may be the case that they are needed. However, they certainly will not be the only step in tackling this very serious and emotionally damaging issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The Garda Síochána takes this issue very seriously. Before Christmas, gardaí seized 32 dogs and four horses in the Baldoyle area of north Dublin as part of the ongoing investigations into illegal puppy farms and related criminal activity. On examination, six of the dogs were found to be pregnant. This kind of targeted enforcement is generally intelligence led and gardaí have stated that information from the public has been critical in investigations that are leading to seizures. If any members of the public have any information on suspected dog theft I would strongly urge them to contact An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Gardaí have also disseminated information through the national crime prevention officer network on keeping animals secure and preventing those forms of theft. The Garda national crime prevention unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups along with insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has also published new regulations in the past year covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations of 2019. </p>
          <p eId="para_508"> In practical terms the most important message that we all need to communicate may well be about microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals' welfare and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped. It is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at veterinary practices and by An Garda Síochána. They are by far the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs. I urge anyone considering buying a puppy to ask to see the pup in its home environment with its mother. One should never buy a puppy from someone who offers to meet away from the puppy's home. Ask for evidence that the seller or supplier of the dog is registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or, if they are a dog breeding establishment, with their local authority and ask to see the certificate of registration of the microchip. It should never be the case that one is buying a dog informally from someone one does not know without any paperwork or checking that the dog is microchipped. </p>
          <p eId="para_510"> As I noted in my opening contribution, Deputies will appreciate that this Bill is particularly time sensitive. We are hoping to enact and commence it in the coming weeks. If we do not we risk being referred to the Court of Justice and having a heavy fine imposed. I recognise Deputy Naughten's genuine interest in the issue of pet theft and the damage that does to families whose pet has been stolen. It is a horrific crime to perpetuate against families and against the pets. However, on the basis of the urgency of this Bill I cannot agree to delay it any further as stated in the amendment but I am very happy to work with Deputy Naughten and any Deputy to advance proposals which may include legislative change, if needed, over the coming months to target and challenge any of those criminals who are targeting pets and inflicting that level of emotional damage on families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Mythen<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_512">I thank the Acting Chairman. I welcome the chance to speak on this Bill. As outlined by my colleagues in Sinn Féin who spoke previously, I, too, am supporting this legislation. I also commend my fellow Wexford man, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, on bringing forward this Bill. The Bill is welcome because it seeks to tackle aspects of white collar crime, corruption, fraud, tax evasion and specific offences against the EU's financial interests and, therefore, Ireland's interests. We know that these types of crime embezzle millions of euro of taxpayers' money each year. I am sure all of us have heard and are aware of the double Irish and the treble Dutch, along with laundering of money across the European Union by well-organised criminal gangs, so the importance of tackling this problem cannot be overstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> There has been debate and discussion on this Bill as it made its way through the Seanad. I have read the contributions so far to the Second Stage debate here in the Dáil so I will not cover old ground. However, I understand that an amendment has been tabled on this Stage regarding animal theft. As this is an issue of great concern by pet owners in Wexford, I would appreciate a little time to speak on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The theft of pets is on the increase. Arguably, it is fast becoming a lucrative source of finance for the criminal fraternity who are also connected to illegal puppy farms. On the other hand, it is a very distressing crime for pet owners and that needs to be dealt with. I appreciate the intent behind the amendment. The amendment states that pets are much more than property. I certainly agree with that position especially during the Covid-19 pandemic when animals have played a huge role in providing essential comfort and support to many families and isolated citizens. We need to be careful not to delay the passing of this Bill as this amendment would do. </p>
          <p eId="para_515"> In the interim, there are other things the Minister of State could do to prevent animal theft. First, microchipping must be promoted and every local authority should have a scanner to assist in reconnecting families with their lost or stolen pets. Second, existing laws to protect pets must be implemented. Since 1 February 2020 we have regulations on the sale and supply of pets. Despite animal welfare organisations reporting hundreds of illegal advertisements the Government has confirmed to Sinn Féin that it has yet to bring forward an infringement case. If we are to have confidence in any changes in law to protect against this crime, existing laws need to be better enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The Government also needs to put resources in place to collate all the data on dog breeders, sellers and microchip numbers to create an accessible central database. The creation of such a database would not only tackle the illegal sale of animals online but would also make it much harder for unscrupulous dog breeders to operate. There is much more that the Government can do in tackling this distressing crime, although it may not be through this specific Bill, which is very important to curtail white collar crime.</p>

        <speech by="#HildegardeNaughton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_519">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I thank the House for the opportunity today to introduce the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020. As we all know, I am bringing this Bill to the House at an incredibly difficult time for Irish aviation.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Our airports, airlines, travel trade and tourism sectors have all suffered an unprecedented collapse in business as a result of Covid-19. Jobs have been lost and incomes decimated in a sector that delivered tremendous growth pre-Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> I have met many people across the industry since coming into office, including employers, small businesses and staff representative bodies. I know that what they want most is a safe route back to trading. That is what we all want for them too and what my main focus will be this year. It will not be easy and at this moment especially it can be difficult to see past the imperative of minimising all but essential travel. However, Irish aviation is incredibly resilient. We have two of the most successful and financially robust airlines in Europe. We have an aviation leasing sector that is world leading and we have modern, high-performing airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> With continued Government support I am absolutely sure Irish aviation will recover quickly and rebuild the global connectivity that is so important for our economy. So far, Government support for the aviation industry is close to €200 million. It is estimated that more than €100 million in financial support has already been made available under the central schemes for Irish airlines and airports, including the wage subsidy scheme, the alleviation of commercial rates and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> In addition to these general business support measures, the Government has also agreed a revised €80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation. As a start, the regional airports programme 2021 to 2025 has recently been launched, with a budget allocation of €21.3 million. It will be targeted at supporting our regional airports in Donegal, Knock and Kerry. A further €32 million is being provided through a new Covid-19 regional State airports programme for Cork and Shannon airports, with another €26 million being set aside to help address airport liquidity issues for Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Donegal, Knock and Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> While on the subject of supporting Irish aviation, I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks, which committed much of its time last year to examining the plight of Irish aviation and making recommendations on how to help it back on its feet. The committee's report identified many of the key issues and contains sensible policy proposals which align closely with the Government's objectives. It reveals a broad political consensus about the importance of aviation and State supports and the need for a co-ordinated effort between industry and the Government in setting out a realistic and clear path for recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> It is against this challenging background that I introduce the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020. This Bill looks to the future and seeks to put in place a modern regulatory system that will underpin Irish aviation for the next decade and more. An internationally competitive and sustainable aviation industry needs a strong and reputable regulatory regime, which is what this Bill provides. The current regime was put in place in the early 1990s, and although it has served the industry well over that time, the institutional structures no longer reflect international best practices. This Bill addresses that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The Bill has three main objectives. It will merge the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, with those of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR. In doing so, it establishes a single independent and strengthened aviation regulator. It establishes a new commercial semi-State company to manage Irish-controlled airspace. It also makes changes to how the airport charges are set at Dublin Airport by putting a greater emphasis on the needs and expectations of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> For the most part, the Bill provides for the redesignation of existing regulatory and business functions. Aviation is a highly regulated industry and the Irish system is mostly formed from adherence to international conventions and agreements and EU law. Much of this Bill is concerned with ensuring these international obligations are properly assigned and the new institutional structures are robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Taking each of the three objectives of the Bill in turn, I will first summarise the provisions of the merger of the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority and the Commission for Aviation Regulation. Currently, between them, these two State bodies are responsible for licensing airlines and individual aircraft; issuing airport operating licences, pilot licences and travel trade licences; inspecting compliance with aviation safety and security standards; setting airport charges at Dublin Airport; consumer rights under EU legislation protecting air passengers; and a range of other related tasks. The industry is required to engage with both entities and there is considerable overlap and interlinking with the engagement. This Bill will streamline the relationship, creating a one-stop regulatory shop, so to speak. The Commission for Aviation Regulation functions will be fully merged into the Irish Aviation Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The second objective of the Bill is to establish a new stand-alone commercial State company to provide air navigation services. This service is currently provided by the IAA, which has a dual regulatory and commercial function. This dual model was conceived in the 1990s and regulatory developments in international aviation since make it something of an outlier. It is simply not good practice to have a commercial and regulatory function in the same organisation, especially when part of the regulatory remit involves oversight of the commercial business. It is a self-regulation arrangement, which is not an idea that finds much support nowadays. Therefore, as we merge the commission's regulatory functions into the IAA, we will at the same time remove the commercial business and set it up in a wholly separate State company.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> Both of these steps - merging the regulatory functions of the IAA and CAR while establishing a new commercial State air navigation company - involve the reassignment of staff and the redistribution of assets and liabilities. The Bill provides a clear and fair legal structure for the transfer of functions, land, assets and staff. On the matter of staff in particular, employees will move with their current positions on no less favourable terms and conditions. This commitment is set out in the Bill and it means staff remuneration and pension entitlements will not be affected by the institutional changes. The vast majority of staff will not notice any material change in their day-to-day work. There will be only minimal changes with respect to office locations in and around Dublin city centre and this will be on an agreed basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I am glad to say my Department, the IAA and the CAR have maintained an open and very constructive dialogue with staff and their representative bodies on the provisions of this Bill. I am advised there is broad support for the reforms and comfort with the provisions of the Bill on terms and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The third objective of the Bill is to make changes to how airport charges are set at Dublin Airport. Under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is responsible for setting the maximum price that Dublin Airport can charge airlines for use of its facilitates. It is a complex economic regulatory process but its purpose is to ensure that the price charged by Dublin Airport, which is ultimately paid for by airline customers, is fair and sufficient to cover the development and maintenance of the airport. In setting a maximum price, the regulator effectively frames the medium-term development plan of Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The proposed changes set out in the Bill are based on recommendations arising from an independent review of the current framework, a review which included extensive industry and public consultation. The changes do not alter the main thrust of the existing price-setting regime but rather make incremental improvements that have the effect of strengthening the role of the regulator for the benefit of consumers. This part of the Bill contains policy changes, whereas the provisions on the institutional changes to the IAA and the CAR are almost exclusively about moving around existing functions. For that reason, I will take time to introduce these proposed policy changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> First, the Bill provides for a change to the statutory objectives of the airport charges regulatory regime. Throughout the aforementioned independent review process, it became clear that the overarching objective for the regulator should be to protect the interests of consumers while maintaining high standards of safety and security. This idea is reflected in the Bill, which sets out that the primary statutory objective of price setting at Dublin Airport shall be "to protect and promote the reasonable interests of current and prospective users of Dublin Airport". That objective is set above all others.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> The Bill also for the first time requires the regulator to take account of Government policy on climate change when making a decision on the price and the medium-term development of Dublin Airport. There are a number of other noteworthy policy amendments and improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Currently, the Minister for Transport has the power to provide policy directions to the regulator, which must be considered when making a decision on airport charges. This power has been used by previous Ministers, but on reflection, it is difficult to square such a provision with the idea of strong, independent regulation. Therefore, it is proposed to remove it and instead provide that the regulator must have regard to current Government aviation policy. This will ensure that the regulator's periodic review of airport charges will be appropriately framed within the context of current Government policy, but without being subject to specific ministerial instructions which could cut across regulatory independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Another change proposed in the Bill is to place a new obligation on the regulator to produce a statement of strategy every three years, setting out details and indicators of its performance. This is an additional level of accountability and transparency and is intended to dovetail with greater independence in decision-making. The Bill also introduces some additional flexibility into the regulatory process, by allowing the regulator to extend its current decision on the maximum airport charge price for up to two years. Currently, the regulator reviews and resets the maximum airport charge at Dublin Airport every five years. This will continue to be the norm, but the Bill allows for some flexibility around this, so long as all parties - the regulator, the airport and the airlines - agree that it is in the common interest to apply it.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Changes are also proposed to the regulatory appeals process. Currently, where an appeal of a regulatory decision on airport charges is made, the Minister for Transport is required to appoint a panel of up to three experts to hear the appeal. That panel of experts has the power to revert the regulatory decision back to the regulator for reconsideration. However, during the review of the regime, concern was raised from all sides about this process. It was suggested that any ministerial involvement was inappropriate and that the process had no teeth, with the appeals panel having no ability to direct the regulator to make changes to the determination. Ultimately, it is recommended that the current process be abolished. That is what I am providing for. In its place, it is proposed that all parties may appeal a regulatory decision directly to the courts. While there would normally be concerns raised about pricing the ordinary person out of an appeals process by requiring them to engage professional legal expertise at possible great expense, all of the appeals lodged under the current process to date have been taken by either airlines or the airport authority. Indeed, I understand that it is the practice in the current appeal process to employ legal representation, although it is not required. The likelihood of a single individual taking an appeal on this matter is remote.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Finally, to ensure that the airport charges regime continues to deliver on its proposed new objectives, there is a new provision for periodic reviews of regulatory policy. Such a review will consider the effectiveness of the current regime and will make recommendations for any changes. It will include stakeholder engagement and be cognisant of any changes to market conditions. Aviation is an ever-changing industry and it is critical to Ireland's economic interests. Therefore, it is important that we get the level of economic regulation right and so it is prudent to provide for future review of the regime to ensure that what we have is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> In conclusion, this Bill contains important institutional and regulatory reforms which, if enacted, will provide a regulatory framework more suited to the demands of 21st century aviation. We are currently operating under structures first envisaged almost 30 years ago. Time to refresh is overdue. I know the industry is in a very difficult place at the moment and I have no doubt that it has more pressing concerns than regulation. However, my focus has to be on more than just the immediate crisis. The Government agreed an €80 million financial package for Irish aviation before Christmas, which will be rolled out through various support schemes in the coming months. If more is needed to be done, it will be done. This Bill is looking to what we need post-crisis and it is seeking to put in place now the structures that will serve Irish aviation for the next decade and more. It strengthens independent regulatory oversight, it addresses institutional structures that are outdated and it makes changes to ensure that consumers are better served and that their rights and expectations are recognised and acted upon. I look forward to this debate on the Bill and to discussing it in more detail on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_542">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 that seeks to reconfigure substantially our aviation and navigation regulation services. Sinn Féin is happy to support the Bill and will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage that we believe will improve on it. Before I delve into the issues of the Bill, I want to address the huge challenge facing workers in the aviation sector. I welcome the Minister of State's concluding remarks that if more is needed to be done, it will be done. There is a very firm opinion among workers in the sector that more does need to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Sinn Féin fully supports the recent additional restrictions placed on international travel. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that we would like to see these strengthened further. Given the very high infection levels, the emergence of new coronavirus variants and the importance of protecting the vaccine roll-out, we believe very strict rules for international arrivals are essential during this time. There is still no mandatory quarantine, mandatory hotel quarantine or post-arrival testing. This is something that needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> It must be realised, however, that the extension of public health restrictions means the extension of the current challenges faced by those working in the aviation and travel sector. Therefore, decisive action is needed now that will help the aviation sector survive, in the first instance, and recover more quickly. To counterbalance and to support the restrictions, the Minister for Transport must now step up and introduce measures to protect jobs in the aviation sector and the State's air connectivity at a time when international travel is significantly reduced. We have been calling for a range of reforms to help workers, but regrettably these have been resisted by the Government to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> Since the outset of the pandemic, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, has been calling for a payment break for mortgage holders, in addition to protection from credit rating impairment and the accrual of additional interest during this time. This is permitted. As of 2 December 2020, the European Banking Authority, EBA, reactivated its payment break guidelines in light of the growth in Covid-19 infection rates throughout Europe. This position is now also a key ask of workers in the aviation sector. I urge the Minister of State and the Government to ensure that this protection is introduced. The refusal to date to introduce this protection is inexplicable and must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Pilots, cabin crew, ground staff, travel agents and others in the aviation and travel sectors have been some of the hardest hit workers due to the collapse of international travel during the pandemic. Many have not worked in almost a year, many have lost their jobs, while those remaining have suffered significant cuts to their pay during this time. The new restrictions are necessary, but will impact further on those workers and could lead to more job losses. The soundings from the sector are most grave. There is talk that it could be days and weeks, rather than months, before that prospect is upon us.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> It is therefore crucial that the Government steps in now and provides support. There is no contradiction in supporting strongly the public health measures on the one hand and in calling for full support from the State to protect the sector and strategic connectivity on the other. Last year, we raised the issue of the €245 million connectivity fund and asked whether it could be used to support the sector. I received a reply to a parliamentary question last night on the current status of this money, which stated that responsibility for the management and control of it rests with the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. I ask the Minister of State if the Government has engaged with the NTMA on this issue, with a view to using the fund to support the aviation and travel sectors. With the selling of our shares in Aer Lingus, we lost an important seat at the table. It was a decision that Sinn Féin opposed at the time. We continue to be proved correct on the matter. We have lost a seat at the table where we could have influenced the decisions made in a crucially important airline, namely, Aer Lingus. I ask whether the Government has examined a cash for equity approach or an extended line of credit in respect of the airlines based here, to get them over the current challenge. If not, why not?</p>
          <p eId="para_548">There are lots of international comparisons, which I am sure the Minister of State has seen, in terms of the levels of state support that are being provided for the aviation sector. My primary concern in all of this is for the workers in communities right across the country. I am concerned with the international connectivity but also with the strategic regional importance of the aviation sector. It is something that absolutely has to be a number one priority for the Government. According to the international comparisons, Ireland is disproportionately dependent on aviation, yet we are really low in terms of the scale of support that is provided for the sector. We are not even on some of those charts.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Moving on to the Bill at hand, we are happy to support it. I have a number of questions for the Minister of State on various aspects of it. If she does not have time to respond today, she might get back to me with a response in advance of Committee Stage. The initial discussions on these provisions began before I was elected to the Dáil. I watched the discussion on the general scheme that took place at the transport committee in 2019. One of the topics that was raised at that time and not addressed was the cost of reconfiguration. I ask the Minister of State to come back to me with information on how that cost is broken down in terms of funding for staff, new buildings etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> On the rights of workers, I welcome the comments by the Minister of State on the detail of the provisions in this regard. I would like more detail in terms of the level of engagement with workers, the impact these changes will have on them and what measures are being taken to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> In regard to consumer rights, the Bill will see the dissolution of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, with its staff and functions transferring to the Irish Aviation Authority. As a result, the IAA, as regulator, will now hold responsibility for a number of areas, including consumer protection. It is my understanding that the Bill seeks to strengthen protections for consumers by providing enhancement powers to the regulator, including the creation of offences for not complying with a direction of the regulator and continuing daily offences for ongoing failures to comply with such a direction. We have seen time and again the weakness of our regulators. We have seen it, in particular, in the case of people who are waiting for flight vouchers and refunds and, worse again, those who are affected by ghost flights that left without them. They adhered to the public health advice and were penalised. There was no compensation for them and they have no protections. An Teachta O'Reilly and I wrote to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, before Christmas pointing to the weakness of consumer protections in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> In the time remaining to me, I want to flag a number of amendments which, having gone through the Bill in detail, we intend to bring forward on Committee Stage. We believe there is an opportunity to improve it in a number of areas, not least in the area of the operation of the IAA. One of the provisions that we think should be included in the Bill relates to the need for the IAA to have a graduated fines system. The proposed removal of licence as the only stick is a drastic measure and the lack of provision for other sanctions weakens the IAA. There is a need for the IAA stakeholder forums to include all stakeholders and certain parties must not be allowed to demand the exclusion of others. There is a need for industrial relations issues to be comprehensively dealt with by the IAA or for it to have the power to refer them to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. We will argue that the legislation should underpin the peer support programmes across all airlines. Finally, there should be a charter for licence holders setting out the rights and responsibilities of each party and how parties should interact with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I look forward to submitting these and other amendments in due course and to the later deliberations on the Bill. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to address these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. As my colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, has set out, Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill. It makes sense to streamline the set-up in this area and for there to be a single, stand-alone regulator and commercial air traffic control operator. There are many other issues that could be addressed in the Bill. These include a graduated fines system to create a more robust sanctions process, the creation of a stakeholder forum to ensure the inclusion of all parties, including, most importantly, workers, and the ability for the Irish Aviation Authority to be able to deal comprehensively with industrial relations disputes or refer them to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> All elected representatives in this State have been hearing from workers in the aviation sector who are very worried about their prospects of returning to work. The sector has been hit very hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and supports for workers need to remain in place. It is important that we protect air connectivity routes during the pandemic, but the Minister of State cannot forget about the workers in the sector. Many of them have families and dependents who rely on her to represent them at Cabinet and ensure that appropriate and necessary supports remain in place for them. It is essential to managing the pandemic on this island that travel in and out of the State is hugely regulated in the period ahead. This must not be to the detriment of workers and all of the economic supports need to remain in place for them. I trust that the Minister of State will be proactive on this issue when speaking with her ministerial colleagues in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, also needs to be more proactive when it comes to tackling importation of the Covid-19 virus onto this island. We need to see him being more proactive in engaging with his counterpart in the North and in helping the Minister for Health to deliver a safe framework for managing the pandemic across this island, including a regulated transport system. I cannot stress enough the importance of all-island co-operation to ensure a maximum suppression strategy is successful. Managing travel is essential to the success of such a strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> One area in which the Government has been weak is the sharing of data. I appreciate that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Health rather than the Minister for Transport, but the latter has responsibility for passenger locator forms. There has not been enough sharing of any of the data on passengers coming into the island, whether into Belfast or Dublin. The Northern Ireland Assembly's health committee heard this morning that no formal request for data sharing of passenger locator forms has been received on its end. The Minister of State might be able to tell us why this is the case and what the Minister is doing to ensure maximum cross-Border co-operation in fighting the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I will conclude by raising an issue which it would be remiss of me not to mention, namely, mandatory quarantine. The Government has been very weak on travel restrictions. The Minister has taken advice from NPHET and watered it down or, in some cases, not implemented it at all. We need island-wide mandatory quarantining in designated facilities. That is the only way to stop importation of the virus. The approach the Government is taking will miss perhaps 40% of the cases coming into the State and, indeed, onto the island. It is shameful that it has taken this long even to introduce such measures. NPHET recommended last summer that mandatory quarantine should be introduced. It is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> We support the substance of this Bill but there are areas in which we would like to see it strengthened and, as I outlined, aspects of the whole set-up that we would like to see improved.</p>

          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_560">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. As advised by an Teachta O'Rourke, Sinn Féin will be supporting this legislation. We support the substance of it and we will, of course, be putting forward constructive amendments. I sincerely hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will work with us to ensure the Bill is amended where appropriate. I very much welcome her statement that if more needs to be done, more will be done. As the debate goes on, we will hear about those things that need to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> Dublin Airport is in my constituency and, as a result, I have a very keen interest in developments in the area of air transport and navigation. My interest is particularly keen when it comes to the workers at the airport and the residents living in the environs of Dublin Airport or, indeed, far from the airport but under the flight path of the aeroplanes that arrive into and depart from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">With that in mind, I would like to speak to these points.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Developments in air transport and navigation are always advancing, and they have been even during the pandemic. One of the main developments that concerns me is the failure of the State to protect air connectivity routes during the pandemic. We are an island nation, yet as a State we do not have a stake in an airline or ferry company.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The pandemic is having a devastating effect on a host of sectors, but particularly on the aviation sector, which has been largely shut for almost a year. Many workers in the aviation sector have lost their jobs and others in the sector have seen their incomes drop by anything from 50% to 90%. Sinn Féin is conscious of the massive impact that Covid-19 has had on workers in the aviation industry and it has worked closely with unions to ensure airlines fulfil their obligations to workers at this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The workers in the sector, especially in Aer Lingus, have been systematically and continually let down by successive governments. Indeed, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were all party to the sell-off of Aer Lingus. Both Sinn Féin and I totally opposed the selling off of the remaining State share of the company at the time, and we remain opposed to it today. The decision was short-sighted and so too are the decisions currently being taken by the Government that are putting Aer Lingus at continuous risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Speaking in the Dáil at the selling off of the remaining State share of the company, the Labour Party's Deputy Howlin said that he welcomed "the commitments offered to the existing workforce in Aer Lingus". He went on to state: "As the chief executive officer has indicated to the Minister, he remains committed to an employer-employee engagement model that has unions and the State's industrial relations apparatus at its heart." This was challenged by Sinn Féin at the time and we could see the dangers ahead for Aer Lingus workers. The commitments given appear to have little meaning and the current Government is unwilling to intervene to protect the livelihoods of the workers in Aer Lingus. Not alone did the Labour Party – I believe Deputy Howlin was the leader at the time – sell off the share in Aer Lingus but it also had the neck to lecture the workers that doing so would be for their own good. We all see now the folly of that decision and we do not buy the nonsense that there was no choice. There are always choices in politics. There are always decisions to be made and positions to be taken, and people cannot pick and choose and simply say later that they are sorry or that somebody else made them make the decision when it was clearly not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Across Europe, other states have used relaxed state aid rules to retake shares in their national airlines. Given the severe risk to the future of Irish-based airlines, Sinn Féin previously called on the Government to examine using the €245 million connectivity fund, which was established from the proceeds of the disastrous decision to privatise Aer Lingus fully, to retake a stake in the airline if necessary to support jobs and protect routes. I join my colleague, an Teachta O'Rourke, in asking the Minister of State the status, if any, of the discussions with the National Treasury Management Agency on the connectivity fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Speaking of Aer Lingus, it would be remiss of me not to mention the treatment of workers at the airline as they fight to access their social welfare entitlements. A significant number of workers at Aer Lingus who are entitled to short-time work support payments feel that the Department of Social Protection is rejecting their claims because the UP38 forms filled out by the airline do not reflect the true reality of the situation and how they are paid. As a result, the applications of these workers for short-time work support has been rejected by local Intreo offices and the Department of Social Protection. I urge the Government to intervene and address this situation. It has been going on for almost a year now.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> On the same theme, that of workers' rights, it is beyond doubt that employment law and the failures of successive governments to rectify it have allowed bogus self-employment to run rampant in this State. From the construction industry and RTÉ to the so called gig-economy, bogus self-employment is a massive problem. The aviation sector is another area where the problem is systemic. Irish pilots have consistently highlighted how Irish employment law facilitates bogus self-employment right across Europe. The Minister of State might believe this is a point better raised with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade, and Employment – it has been, as far as I know – but the fact that nearly half of all pilots operating in Irish-registered airlines are not employed directly by the airline for whom they fly is a major safety concern, and it should be a worry for the Minister of State. I urge her to bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Ministers and to offer her support for the Sinn Féin Organisation of Working Time (Workers' Rights and Bogus Self-Employment) (Amendment) Bill 2019, which seeks to tackle the scourge of bogus self-employment in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I wish to raise an issue of considerable concern for the residents in the environs of Dublin Airport. Pre-planning discussions have taken place between the aircraft noise competent authority and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, regarding the noise abatement objective, but only one stakeholder has been invited. The DAA is the only stakeholder that has been invited to these discussions, and the residents who live with the impact of the noise have been excluded. This is not fair and has to be rectified. Will the Minister of State ensure that the residents are invited to participate in discussions on the noise abatement objective?</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> The DAA has applied for planning permission to change aspects of the conditions on the operation of the new runway at Dublin Airport, yet there has been no public consultation. Will the Minister of State take an interest in this and ensure that the residents are not ignored and that the consultation period is extended to allow for meaningful consultation with all parties, especially those living in the environs of the airport, who are directly impacted by it?</p>

          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_572">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Thousands of workers in the aviation sector, at all levels and grades, are keeping a keen eye on what has been happening in the Dáil and Seanad in recent weeks, and they will also be doing so in the upcoming weeks. While the Labour Party will be supporting this Bill and while, like Sinn Féin, it looks forward to engaging constructively on amendments it will be submitting, we are surprised that, important as it is, the Bill is still about process and still technical. It comes at a time when we are sitting fewer days and for fewer hours to deal specifically with emergency Covid-19-related legislation. I am encouraged by the Minister of State's words to the effect that what needs to be done in the aviation sector will be done, but these words have been stated by the Minister, Taoiseach and Tánaiste for a number of months. While supports have been given to workers through the temporary wage subsidy scheme and employment wage subsidy scheme and while some structural supports have been given to the company, the aviation industry requires a survival package. There is no other way of putting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I ask the Minister of State to look at today's letters page in <i>The Irish Times</i>. A letter by Captain Joe May has been published. He is not a constituent of mine but he speaks for a broad constituency of aviation workers. They are not seeing an effort by the Government to save the industry, an important industry that, by its very nature, connects us to the rest of the world and connects our economy to every economy in Europe, North America and beyond and that will ensure, when this pandemic ends, our recovery will be as fast as possible. While they are concerned about the very basics, including financial supports for workers and the questions of whether they can pay their mortgages, cover their bills and retain their jobs, they are also very much concerned about the tenuousness of the structural issues at the airport. Will the airplanes on the ground or in hangars still be in Dublin, Shannon or Cork in a month, two months, three months or six months, or will they be sold off? Any aircraft lost to one of our national airlines means job losses will soon follow. That is a fact. These are genuine concerns. Trade unions and other workers' representative groups are jumping up and down, as it were.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> If, as I really hope, talks are taking place at a senior level, can we hear about them? Will the Minister of State give us some confidence that there are supports and a package that will keep the industry in existence until such time as we get through this public health crisis? The workers are as scared and worried about this pandemic as every other person in this country. They understand it and the virulence of the variants. They understand how scary the virus is. They see the numbers of deaths and of people in intensive care, who include their families and friends. There is hardly a family in this country that has not now been touched by this disease, and we probably all know someone who has died from it. The workers understand the impact it is having on their industry, but they also understand it is their industry that will be relied upon to get us out of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> While this Bill is welcome and needed, it is not at the front line of what aviation workers and their families are seeking from the Government, this House and all of us. That needs to be addressed, in terms of the communications. The public health measures that are being brought in needed to be brought in and the Labour Party supports a national aggressive suppression strategy. As stated by a previous speaker, bringing in such an aggressive strategy to keep the virus down should not be seen as being contrary or set against the need to protect the aviation industry or as an attack on the aviation industry. The reason we need a national aggressive suppression strategy is so the economy can reopen and workers can go back to their jobs, including the aviation industry and the support industries around it. They need to be looked at as two sides of the same coin moving forward together.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I am concerned, particularly following public utterances of the Tánaiste, that this will involve an adversarial approach. When this House is discussing mandatory hotel quarantine under the legislation which will apparently take weeks, which is very disappointing, I am concerned it will be set as an adversarial approach to the aviation industry. The aviation industry is an innocent victim of what has happened with Covid-19. There are thousands of families out there looking for leadership and protections. We really need it. There is a whole communications piece that needs to be done by the Government that it has failed on. I am encouraged by the words of the Minister of State in her opening statement but they need to be stronger and backed up by visible action that people support. There are very few industries and workers in this country who are as politically engaged as people who have worked in the aviation sector. They have gone through many recessions and privatisations. They have gone through an awful lot, so no one will pull the wool over their eyes, no matter what they say in this Chamber. Everyone in the aviation sector is wise to the realities of their sector. We all need to be careful about how we speak to the workers and how truthful we are to them about what is going on. There is a gap in what the Government is saying and what it is offering to those workers and that sector. There are some issues with the substance of the Bill. The Bill is welcome, we support it and it makes sense. However, similar to an Teachta O'Rourke earlier, we will look to bring amendments in relation to the need for graduated sanctions. At the moment, the only sanction imposed on entities, be they airlines, maintenance organisations, airports or licence holders, is a revocation of their licence or permit. Many times that is not commensurate to a failing or misstep but, at the same time, some sanction needs to be given. This Bill is an opportunity to do that in detail and well.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> I am delighted the Minister of State has acknowledged the work of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks. The transport committee still feels like a new committee but we are very committed and we put an awful lot of work into that report. There are sensible proposals in it. I hope any amendments to this Bill brought forward by me or other members of that committee through our parties will be seen as sensible and constructive in a similar way to the work we do through the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_578"> There is a cultural issue in relation to aviation and how the stakeholders in aviation are dealt with. It is hard to discuss that through legislation but it does not make it any less real or tangible or in any way less in need of discussion. We have issues where workers' organisations representing licence holders have been excluded from certain forums at the request of larger stakeholders. That is a huge problem which feeds into a culture of diminishing workers' rights in the industry, continues to push down on the trade unions and gives primacy to large companies that have poor records in this regard. By virtue of having these stakeholders, workers and trade unions excluded, the companies put themselves in a leadership position in terms of driving policy which is not, in many areas, to the betterment of workers. That needs to be looked at and we will bring amendments on the issue. It feeds into issues relating to working time, workers in the industry being classed as flexible workers and the impact that has on them seeking justice through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the industrial relations architecture of the State. There are other issues in relation to peer support programmes and charters. It is a question of acknowledging the role that workers of all grades play, bringing them into the process and developing a collective culture in the regulation of the industry. There is an opportunity to do that in this Bill and I hope we will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I want to hammer home the fact that the aviation industry requires a survival package. There are many complex issues in relation to aviation. There are issues related to noise regulation. I echo the calls of the previous speaker on extending the consultation period and bringing the residents in. I have put in my own submission on that. The DAA and others are seeking to have planning conditions set aside in advance of the runway being built and brought into operation. It has not even been tested. That is really damaging to An Bord Pleanála and the planning and decision-making architecture of the State. It is like saying, "Okay, you have made a decision but we disagree with it so straight away we are going to ask for it to be set aside by just making the same case over and over again." That is not good enough. The residents' voices need to be heard and should always be heard on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> There is some reference to climate issues in this Bill in terms of the medium-term responsibility that the aviation sector has in relation to climate. At the moment, it is having a minimal impact on climate because everything is grounded. In the medium and long term, there are huge questions and challenges in relation to that. Everyone, including the workers, needs to be included. We will always need a strong aviation industry in this country, by nature of the fact that we are an island. </p>
          <p eId="para_581"> These are hugely complex issues. As we role out vaccinations, I hope the Government will take on board the approach of the Labour Party and others in relation to a national aggressive suppression strategy - zero-Covid or whatever - to get the numbers down and keep them down. When we call upon our aviation sector, it has to be there. The only body that is able to ensure that is our national Government. It has been done all over Europe in partner states. There is a whole list, which has been printed again this week, of the hundreds of millions that have gone into airlines in more or less all EU member states. Yet here, on an island on the coast of Europe, we have not supported the industry in that regard. That needs to be tackled and addressed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_582">I thank the Minister of State for being in the Chamber to take questions and contributions from Members. Fianna Fáil fully supports the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020. This Bill provides for the institutional reorganisation of aviation regulation in Ireland. The legislation will contribute to best practice approaches and ensure the aviation regulator is fit for purpose for emerging challenges over the coming decades. Currently, aviation regulation is split between the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The IAA is also involved in the provision of some for-profit air navigation services. Its dual commercial-regulatory mandate is an outlier in a European and international context.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">While the IAA is highly regarded at home and abroad, it is difficult to argue for its current functions to persist, given that it is a State body with important non-commercial oversight functions and, at the same time, a commercial mandate to run a service for profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I wish to make a few more general points about aviation. The Government has thus far been very good to aviation, with more than €80 million having been channelled into propping up the sector, which, along with tourism, has been most exposed to the ravages of Covid. Operational capital funding of €22 million was provided for Cork and Shannon Airports and additional regional airport funding for Knock, Kerry and Donegal airports has also been sanctioned. When the Minister of State was concluding her contribution a short time ago, she stated that if more is needed to be done, it will be done. That has to be the starting point for actions hereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> We have all received quite a number of emails during the week from the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, and from members of ground crews and flight crews and all those who work in operations and maintenance, repair and overhaul, MRO. I am very concerned about Lufthansa Technik and all the other MRO companies based around Shannon Airport in my constituency of Clare. They can function only when aircraft are landing at airports and requiring maintenance, and that simply is not happening. It is an ancillary service to aviation that is floundering and it will require State support.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> There is a severe imbalance in aviation and the Minister of State gets this because this point has been made to her repeatedly. The market share that Dublin Airport holds has increased year on year in comparison with other airports, to the detriment mostly of Shannon Airport, and to a lesser extent, of Cork Airport. We will need a new aviation policy to take this country beyond Covid. Some good suggestions have been made to the Minister of State and the Department. The Copenhagen Economics report, commissioned by Limerick Chamber, is one of the best documents I have seen. It looked at other countries such as Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, where aviation policy has been turned on its head. There are now requirements that a certain quota of flights come into the regional airports rather than having everything channelled into the capital city airports. That is good and we need to consider such a measure in Ireland as well. There should not be this imbalance going forward. This low starting point, in the depths of Covid, is the perfect time to overhaul aviation policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> There is a cargo future for Irish aviation and Shannon Airport is positioned to exploit it best. Only 1% of all cargo leaving Ireland is airborne and that could be greatly enhanced. There was some potentially good news this week, with Amazon looking at developing a distribution node at Shannon Airport. Ciaran Callaghan and Damien O'Regan have been in correspondence with the Department about the possibility of a new form of cargo hub, again at Shannon Airport. It has a really long runway with the capacity to take the largest jets in the world, and it is the perfect stepping stone from North America to continental Europe. Our first, tumultuous month of Brexit is behind us and we need to consider enhanced connectivity. It is not all about the land bridge; we need to consider an air bridge as well, and Shannon Airport provides that opportunity, so I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Covid will linger for quite some time. PCR testing is not costed similarly throughout the European Union and there is significant variation, at €140 or €150 in Ireland and other countries, while in Spain and North Macedonia, the very same gold-standard test costs €30. A Ryanair flight, FR7124, will take off at 6.25 a.m. on Saturday next from Dublin Airport and land about three hours later in Lanzarote. That is not essential travel by any metric. I did not get to listen to "Liveline" earlier but I heard that a lady called the show, incredibly, from her balcony in an apartment in Spain, justifying why she should be out there. That is not essential travel. We will only get full buy-in to these restrictions, which nobody likes but which we need, when non-essential flights stop happening. That runs against everything I have been saying for many months, but right now we are at peak Covid and this should not be happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Air fare refunds continue to be a big issue. There is a crazy case in my constituency, where 80 students from St. Joseph's Secondary School in Tulla were due to fly to Barcelona last year for a school tour. Ryanair still owes them €17,500 in air fare refunds but it is playing molly bán, saying it cannot refund the travel agency that booked the trip but that it can refund the individuals. It does not work like that and Ryanair needs to step up to the plate and provide the refunds.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Covid presents opportunities. Business jets are not the domain just of the Kardashians and people who wear bling and gold chains. Many multinational companies bring their staff into and out of Ireland using business jets. Shannon Airport, along with Aruba and the Bahamas, has a singular advantage in that it offers pre-clearance on flights to America. There is a problem, however. Currently, about 1,500 jets a year fly between Ireland and America, but that could be increased four or fivefold. We have reach to 220 airports but that figure could increase to 900 if we were able to overcome a client-catering issue. Food that is served on flights needs to be incinerated at the end of the journey. A new procedure, called the agricultural pre-clearance test programme, was trialled by the US Government in 2018 and was successful. It would open up significant opportunities for Ireland but it needs to be made permanent. I have written to the Biden Administration and the US ambassador to Ireland. The matter is now with the US Department of Agriculture and I implore the Minister of State and the Department to push ahead with that regulation to open the considerable opportunities for Shannon Airport and other airports to better exploit private aviation and the spin-off benefit that has for the communities and regions that surround them.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">I wish to raise issues with the IAA pension scheme and with the treatment of those with an IAA pension and the provisions they have been given. I have raised this matter with the Minister of State through parliamentary questions, and while I understand that she views it, technically, as a private pension scheme, it is fair to say she has some role in its governance. I ask her to meet those who are affected and in receipt of an IAA pension. They have engaged with the IAA board and the Department and are unhappy with the results thus far. I understand that these matters have been referred by the Fórsa trade union to the Minister under section 41(7) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. I ask that the Minister of State consider meeting these people and hearing their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I take this opportunity to acknowledge the strains that Covid-19 have put on those working for airlines. While we understand that people should not travel at the moment unless it is an emergency, we must remember that in March 2020, Ryanair employed more than 17,000 staff and Aer Lingus more than 4,000. I have been contacted daily by some of these people who live in my constituency of Cork North-Central and they are very concerned. The Government needs to enhance the supports available to these workers. They cannot be forgotten about. As I am sure the Minister of State will understand, every time a return to international travel is pushed further away, these workers suffer. In most cases, these people have been out of work for ten months, with no return in sight - no mortgage breaks, no fuel allowance, no additional supports. These workers and their families are concerned and even scared. Without Government supports, these people, who may never have struggled financially before, are really suffering, and it will only get worse in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> We in Sinn Féin have brought forward a wide range of solutions to many of the problems faced by those experiencing financial difficulty in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. I urge the Minister of State to stop dismissing our proposals and solutions and to start listening to our ideas because we want to help ordinary people and families through this crisis.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_18"> Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_596">As the Minister of State said, this Bill introduces institutional reform of the Irish aviation regulatory system and will allow for the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, to merge its own aviation and safety regulatory functions with the economic and consumer protection roles of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, to create a single regulator. It also separates the for-profit air navigation service activities of the IAA into a stand-alone commercial semi-State body.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> As currently structured, the Irish Aviation Authority has a dual mandate, providing both commercial air traffic control services and regulation of airline security and safety, including regulating airlines and IAA's air traffic control services. This system is largely an outlier in a European and international context and there is a growing legal obligation to separate these two powers. With the separation of commercial and non-commercial services, it is important that the Department provides sufficient resources for this transition at the offset. Given the effects of the pandemic, many avenues of income for the industry have been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> When this Bill was presented at committee in 2019, little concern was given at the time to the viability of the new commercial State agency, with aviation then being a growing and profitable industry. The figures given at the time stated that of the €200 million in revenue per year seen by the air traffic control provider, €122 million came from <i>en route</i> services. These were transatlantic flights which did not land in Ireland. Figures released by the IAA in November stated that <i>en route</i> traffic was down by 61.9%. If enough resources are not given at the offset to allow for the change of bodies, it will be very difficult to scale up to what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The aviation sector faces severe challenges with the impact of Covid-19 and the climate crisis. According to the IAA, Ireland’s air traffic declined by 63.3% in 2020. Dublin Airport's traffic declined by 74.5%, Cork Airport's by 79.4%, and Shannon Airport's by 68%. European airports have been hardest hit by the global crisis in the aviation industry brought on by Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I want to speak about consumer protection. As part of this merger, the IAA will now take on the consumer protection obligations of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The commission, which will now fall under the IAA, deals with consumer complaints regarding airline refunds and has stated that it has received more than 4,000 complaints regarding flight refunds from all airlines since the beginning of the pandemic. Under 80% of these have been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The Commission for Aviation Regulation told the transport committee in 2009 that it had a total of 17 staff and highlighted its need to increase capacity, particularly on the consumer protection front. The British consumer magazine <i>Which? Travel</i> recently analysed more than 12,000 complaints about flight refunds and found that four out of ten of these were about Ryanair. Eight out of ten customers were dissatisfied with Ryanair's refund services after their flights were cancelled last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Under EU directives, flight refunds for cancelled flights should be paid back within a week. An incredible amount of flights were cancelled last year, leaving customers fighting with airlines to receive refunds to which they were entitled. A third of the respondents to the UK magazine survey waited more than three months for their refund. None of them received their refund during the legal timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> The Irish Travel Agents Association, ITAA, highlighted the issue earlier this week, detailing the trouble travel agents continue to have while trying to access flight refunds. ITAA member travel agents are currently owed approximately €20 million in refunds from one company alone, which is Ryanair.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Under the EU directive, refunds are only available when the flight has been cancelled, not when the customers choose not to travel. Under the continuing restrictions, many individuals have correctly chosen to be responsible and cancel their flights for non-essential travel. Many of these ghost flights have gone ahead, however, with few or no passengers on board. The refusal to cancel these flights means customers have been unable to access refunds. With the current state of the pandemic and the restrictions on non-essential travel, these flights should not be taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> In terms of environmental issues, airport charges will be a particular concern for the IAA going forward. In 2019, the Commission for Aviation Regulation ruled that the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, should cut the levy it charges airlines to an average of €7.87 per passenger over the period from 2020 to 2024. The body has already committed to reviewing these cuts in light of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Part 9 of this Bill amends the regulation of airport charges in Ireland and outlines the lead objective in determining airport charges to the interests of the customer. The briefing note for this Bill states that all other objectives cascade down from this lead objective. The policies of the Government on climate change are listed 11th out of 12 on the list in terms of consumer considerations. I really want to ask why climate change is 11th out of 12? Why is it not high up, if not top, of the list? I do not understand that. I ask the Minister of State to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Airports across the world are dropping airline and passenger charges in an effort to attract airlines and passengers back. We need to support the recovery of the aviation industry. Post Covid, however, we will need greater consideration of the environmental cost of the aviation strategy, which will see an increase in flight and passenger numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, estimates there were 4.5 billion air passengers globally in 2019, with each year since 2009 breaking a new record until last year. While the knock-on effects of the pandemic will no doubt impact on projections for the aviation industry, the International Air Transport Association had previously predicted a rise to 7.2 billion passengers by 2035.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Under a normal year, it is estimated that aviation consumes 5 million barrels of oil every day, contributing somewhere between 2% to 5% of total global emissions. Calculating its exact impact is complex, as greenhouse gases released at high altitude have different effects than those emitted at ground level. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, had warned that Ireland's aviation emissions were increasing sharply. An economy class return flight from Dublin to New York emits an estimated 0.56 tonnes of CO2 per passenger. As other sectors of the economy were becoming greener, utilising more clean energy, pre-pandemic aviation's proportionate total emissions had been set to rise. Emissions from planes had been rising rapidly, increasing by 32% globally between 2013 and 2018. Gradual improvements in fuel efficiency are welcome but they had been nowhere near enough to address the rapid increase in total passenger numbers that had been ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> In October 2016, 191 nations agreed a UN accord which aims to cut global aviation carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2035. Another ambitious target of that agreement is for the aviation industry to achieve a 50% carbon emission reduction by 2050 compared with 2005 levels. The industry intends to achieve these things through carbon offsetting in the short-term, the continued development of more efficient aeroplanes, deeper investment in sustainable fuels such as biofuels and through better route efficiency. Offsetting helps, but only partially. A recent study by the European Commission found that 85% of offset projects it had evaluated actually failed to reduce emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> If we want to be serious about addressing the climate crisis, cutting our emissions and reaching the targets to which we have committed, then we need to consider climate as a top priority in all aspects of decision-making in the aviation industry and not as an afterthought. I believe it should be top of the list of considerations and not 11th out of 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I have huge concerns about the aviation industry right now in terms of jobs and the thousands of families who are in a precarious situation and who are extremely worried, especially in the past month, given that we will not get the recovery in air travel we might have hoped for earlier in this pandemic. They understand the public health situation we are in and that there will not be that early recovery many would have hoped for.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There is a lot of concern that the kind of resilience that has gotten our airline industry this far is coming under increased pressure. It is welcome that the Minister of State has said that if more needs to be done, it will be done but I have to say that the people who have been in contact with me and who work in the aviation industry and in airlines are strongly of the view that more needs to be done now. They are fearful that if more is not done quickly and urgently and on the sort of scale we have seen from other European governments, there will not be the kind of aviation industry we need as an island in terms of our connectivity and of its strategic importance. I am sure the Minister of State agrees with me on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> One must look at the state aid that has been given to airlines and authorised by the European Commission since the pandemic started. The figures published by the European Commission on state aid approval as of 23 December 2020 show the following: in Austria, Austria Airlines was given €150 million; in Belgium, Brussels Airlines was given €290 million; in Croatia, Croatia Airlines was given €12 million; in Denmark, SAS was given €583 million; in Estonia, Nordica was given €30 million; in Finland, Finnair was given €286 million; in France, Corsair International was given €137 million and Air France was given €7 billion; in Germany, Condor was given €550 million and Lufthansa was given €9 billion; in Greece, Aegean Airlines was given €120 million; in Italy, Alitalia was given €199 million; in Latvia, airBaltic was given €250 million; in Poland, LOT Polish airlines was given €650 million; in Portugal, SATA Air Açores was given €133 million and TAP Air Portugal was given €1.2 billion; in Romania, Blue Air was given €62 million; and in Sweden, SAS was given €486 million. When almost €25 billion in state aid had been given to airlines and approved by the EU Commission, the corresponding figure for Ireland was zero.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> It is worth noting that none of these 16 countries are islands and none of them have the kind of reliance on aviation that we have as an island country and economy. The lack of direct support given in Ireland, in comparison with other European countries is glaring and of huge concern to everyone who is working in the industry. The commitment the Government gave was that if more needs to be done, it will be done. Now is the time to deliver on that commitment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_616">I am glad that this Bill has reached Second Stage in the Dáil. The proposed provisions of the Bill were the subject of prelegislative scrutiny in the last Dáil. I am aware that the relevant stakeholders are anxious to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible. This Bill is a reforming one, as has been said, and is a consequence of the national aviation policy, published in 2015, which included a commitment to restructure the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority and the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The Bill takes into account developments in the EU and international best practice. In addition to this, an independent review of the Irish regulatory regime in respect of airport charges was conducted and concluded in 2017. Subsequently, in September 2017, a national policy statement on the review of airport charges was published. This made the case for the reform of aviation regulation as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> The Bill establishes a single regulator for safety, security and economic regulation, as well as consumer protection, to be known as the Irish Aviation Authority. In addition, the Bill separates out for-profit air navigation services into a new commercial State company to be known as the Irish air navigation service. The Bill, therefore, is overdue and reflects ongoing developments in aviation regulation practices internationally, as the Minister of State has said.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> I would like to raise some general issues concerning aviation. Because of Covid-19 and restrictions on international travel, the Irish aviation sector and our airlines are experiencing serious difficulties. These difficulties are outlined in the PwC Ireland report on the 2021 outlook for the aviation industry, published last month. Irish aviation employees have taken significant pay cuts and others have been the subject of involuntary redundancies. Many are on the PUP or have been put on the employment wage subsidy scheme. I am aware that Aer Lingus employees have faced enormous difficulties in claiming social welfare benefits due to problems in getting forms signed in the airline. The PUP and the employment wage subsidy scheme must be extended for these employees for as long as the crisis continues. These employees also need an extension of mortgage breaks for another 12 months, without impacting on their credit worthiness. I would also argue that the Government must consider providing meaningful financial support for our indigenous airlines in order to avoid structural collapse. Other national governments have done this, as we have heard, so why can we not do this here in Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> There is also the ongoing matter of Ryanair giving refunds to passengers who booked flights and paid for them, only to have them cancelled due to Covid-19. I have heard Michael O'Leary of Ryanair state on many occasions that all refunds have been paid, yet a number of constituents are in touch with me to say they are still awaiting refunds. This is also causing problems for travel agents. Something is not adding up here and I am not accusing anybody of anything but I would just like to know the position, given the conflicting statements. Can the Minister of State get onto the Commission for Aviation Regulation and insist that it make the airline refund passengers and enforce the EU regulation on this matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Aircraft noise in the vicinity of Dublin Airport has also been a concern for many of my constituents but it is not at the moment. I am aware that Fingal County Council has established the aircraft noise competent authority. It has a mandate to assess current and predicted future levels of aircraft noise at Dublin Airport, including noise assessments of future planning applications for development at the airport. I suggest that the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks needs to examine the role of this competent authority, given that it is relatively new, to see how it is functioning. I would also like to support the calls of previous speakers to ensure that the planning issues arising from the proposed new runway are dealt with so that residents have an input to the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I want to draw the attention of the Minister of State to plans by the Dublin Airport Authority to install a new drop-off and pick-up zone at Dublin Airport. This is not a good idea and these plans should be scrapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> I also wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State to the concerns of air traffic controllers employed by the Irish Aviation Authority at Dublin Airport on their superannuation scheme. A submission has been made to the Minister in accordance with section 41 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. I hope the Minister of State can look at this submission favourably and come to a decision as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I hope that this Bill has a speedy passage through both Houses. The detailed provisions of the Bill can be thrashed out on Committee and Report Stages. There will not be too many problems in dealing with the provisions of the Bill as that legislative process continues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_624">I reiterate what Deputy O'Rourke and other members of my party have said, that we support the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 but will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage. We support the Bill on the basis that this is a streamlining of the regulatory system, that is, the Commission for Aviation Regulation being subsumed into the Irish Aviation Authority, and the Institute for Air Navigation Services, IANS, which is the for-profit section, dealing with air navigation services, being paid for through landing charges. This is best practice. Some of our amendments will relate to the fact that we need to make sure it is fit for capacity and is fully resourced. I welcome, as many Members have, the Minister of State's statement that what needs to be done will be done. We merely need to ensure that that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Others have already spoken about consumers' rights. I would add to their voice that we need to ensure that we give capacity to this outfit to be able to deliver. During this pandemic we have seen issues, not only relating to consumers' rights but workers' rights. Deputy O'Reilly brought up the fact that Aer Lingus workers were not able to avail of shorter working week payments because they were not facilitated by Aer Lingus and that we need Government and departmental nous to be brought to bear to fix that retrospectively for workers who have been waiting on some of those payments for quite a considerable amount of time. Others have spoken about the fact that Ryanair has not paid out, particularly on group bookings, some of which are school group bookings. It said it will deal with the individual who paid but there could be varying costs to some of these tickets that were bought in bulk. It is utterly disingenuous of Ryanair. It needs to be sorted. We need to ensure that we give a body such as this the capacity to deal with such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We all accept the absolute necessity of connectivity and of the maintenance of an aviation sector beyond this pandemic. We fully support restrictions and guidelines as well as quarantining, on which there have been calls from my party to ensure happens and becomes a reality as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, about dealing with all the stakeholders, be they the airlines, the airports or the representatives of the pilots and the other workers, from the point of view of ensuring we look after their rights and give them the capacity to get through this pandemic so that we have a system and a service that will operate for us afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> We are an island and we have difficulties. I would add that we need to make sure there is transfer of traveller information, North and South, for people coming in so that we can try to put an all-island response together as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_629">It is clear that there are deep problems with both of the existing regulatory bodies in aviation, the CAR and the IAA. In theory, amalgamating both in a wide-sweeping change has merit but whether this Bill and the reasoning behind it addresses the weaknesses in both is certainly questionable. Equally, it has long been pointed out by workers and others that IAA was fundamentally compromised in regulating airlines to which it was dependent for its funding. In theory, separating those functions, such as air traffic control, from its safety and other functions and its oversight of those airlines sounds like a good idea. The issue is whether the new authority will regulate in the interests of both workers in the industry and ordinary people in terms of safety, etc., and on that I have concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> To start with, the problems with both regulatory authorities are the same with many of the State's other regulatory bodies. They follow a light touch self-regulation model. They fail to enforce the rules and standards that protect people, specifically workers. We have a Health and Safety Authority, for example, that had to be dragged into workplaces during the pandemic, continues to take a hands-off approach when confronted with glaring breaches of safety that threaten workers and even now insists it will not close workplaces in breach of regulations. It cannot determine anything in terms of whether workplaces are essential. It cannot make determinations in terms of workers working from home. One could also go on for a long time about banking and financial regulation in this country or the health services regulator and the failures there. This is across all sectors of the State. We have a light touch, often non-existent, regulatory approach to many business interests because we have one of the most neoliberal states in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> In aviation, we have many reasons to be concerned. We have a Commission for Aviation Regulation responsible for regulating the airlines which has consistently let Ryanair off the hook and which refused to take legal action against the airline when it broke the rules because it did not want to risk it for fear Ryanair would stop co-operating with it. This was three years ago when the airline cancelled thousands of flights. The UK's regulator said the airline had misled its passengers about their consumer rights but the Irish regulators, yet again, were too cosy with Ryanair to notice. Over the past year, we have had Ryanair and others dragging their heels on paying out refunds and little or nothing being done by the regulators. It seems there is one law for the rich and another for the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The failures of the IAA to regulate are even more worrying. I will cite two examples. First, despite being repeatedly told by workers in the sector that there are health and safety issues with the work practices of one specific airline it not only failed to examine or take the issues seriously, but attacked a Channel 4 documentary outlining those issues and sided firmly with Ryanair in that dispute. The use of zero-hour contracts, the constant pressure and stress placed on pilots and the use, which, I believe, has been abandoned since, of league tables on pilots fuel use designed to pressurise them into potentially unsafe practices all were deemed not worthy of the regulator's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> More worrying is the question mark that remains over the role of the IAA in the tragedy of the Blackrock crash, when four Irish Coast Guard crew tragically died when a helicopter crashed in 2017. Years after that tragedy, relatives and loved ones are still awaiting answers. Why do we still not have the formal report? We are told that the report was sent to interested parties in September 2019, one such party against whom there are adverse findings has raised objections and this is delaying the finalising of the report. This is outrageous. I would ask the Minister to prioritise the publication of the investigation and to act on its findings. At this stage, it is unacceptable that anyone would seek to delay the report's findings coming out. What we know is that there are very serious questions here. A Katie Hannon report on the RTÉ website from 2017 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_634"> RTÉ’s Prime Time has reported that new maps published by the Irish Aviation Authority contain errors which the authority was alerted to.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_635"> Nine days after the R116 crashed into Blackrock Island, the IAA was informed that Sceilg Mhichíl was depicted on their maps. Last July, the IAA told Prime Time that after the discovery of the error, a "review of all other coastal islands was conducted and their data verified.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_636"> "No further anomalies of substance were found."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_637"> However, there were other substantial anomalies on the maps.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The report goes into detail on a number of those anomalies.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> This new body must co-operate fully with the investigators in the air accident unit and aid the publication as soon as possible of the report. It is to be hoped that this new authority can cast aside that past and do the job that, in theory, it is meant to do - protect workers and consumers and ensure safety in aviation.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> I will conclude by raising the question of who will head up this authority. Given the problems I have outlined in the past with the IAA and the CAR and their hands-off approach to regulating or being in conflict with the largest airline in this country, I have to ask whether it is appropriate that we appoint as head a person who is a former CEO of Malta Air, a company in the Ryanair group. How on earth can the Government justify appointing a CEO from the Ryanair airline group as the new head? That is not to cast any doubt on the personal qualities of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">At least in terms of perception, though, it looks like a case of asking the fox to guard the hen house.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The pay for the head of this regulator is ludicrous. It was previously reported that the salary would be almost €400,000 per year. Is that still the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> We have seen the revolving door between the Cabinet table and corporate lobbying, with former Ministers of State now heading up lobbying for so-called investment managers as well as the banks. There is also a revolving door between big business and the regulators. We know that the company involved, Ryanair, has an appalling record of mistreating workers and passengers and putting profits before safety, yet one of its former senior people is now being put in charge of protecting the safety of all passengers and airline workers. It is ludicrous. This is just another example of the cosy relationship between the regulators and those they are meant to be regulating. We saw where that got us in terms of the banks. Yet again, we have a Government that is in the pockets of the rich putting profit before people.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> These are not historical issues. During the Covid pandemic, Ryanair launched an attack on trade union members. It sacked several for union activity, tore up workers' contracts and took an appallingly cavalier attitude towards health and Covid measures. I do not at all blame the particular individual for that or for Mr. O'Leary's more outrageous attacks on public health advice, but I question the appropriateness of the State appointing a person from a business group that has aggressively dismissed public health concerns and sacked trade union members.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> I welcome that climate policies will be a new consideration of the authority, but this and the implications for airport charges and so on need to be spelled out more explicitly in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">This is a difficult time for the aviation industry. I wish to discuss a number of concerns that have been raised with me by constituents in recent weeks. They are worried about the future of the aviation sector in Ireland, the continued lockdown and the impact of Covid-19 on the sector's financial viability. They have raised with me their genuinely held concerns that if airlines are not financially supported, they will abandon routes to and from this country, leaving us less connected internationally. As a small, open economy that is highly dependent on international trade, foreign direct investment and tourism, this cannot be allowed to happen. We need an aviation industry that is intact and ready to take off to assist with the economic recovery that will follow this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> Our airlines rely on summer bookings to make enough money to tide them over the loss-making winter season. The loss of a second consecutive summer season after an entire year of practically zero revenue will prove fatal for airlines that have already decimated their cash reserves. Reports suggest that Aer Lingus alone has been losing approximately €1 million per day since last April, some 300 days ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Our airlines are intrinsic to the success of our island nation and their routes supply our economic lifeblood, bringing foreign direct investment and an estimated €10 billion into the economy annually. Every aircraft that leaves Ireland will represent lost jobs and lost GDP. It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the economy will be devastating. The UK Government provided a loan worth €670 million to Ryanair, an Irish airline, such was the value it placed on Ryanair's contribution to the UK's economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The window remaining for decisive action is fast closing. Airlines plan and budget for their important summer schedules at this time of year. They will soon have to make difficult decisions based on expected market conditions. Airline owners will not allow yet another lost summer. The potential remains that they will cut their losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> If international travel must be suppressed in future - it must be for the health of our people - then financial support for Irish airlines must be considered. If the Government acts to suppress travel, it must also act to save these vital routes, which connect us to the rest of the world.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cathal Berry<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_651">I will be sharing time with Deputy Shanahan with approximately 15 minutes for me before I hand over to him for the last five minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I thank the Minister of State for attending the Chamber to introduce the Air Navigation and Transport Bill. It is important legislation, in that it upgrades and modernises the regulatory framework for the aviation sector and brings us back in line with our European peers. It is long overdue and, therefore, very welcome. I look forward to supporting its passage through the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The Bill is important because the aviation sector is important, particularly to this country. If one were to ask anyone in the country what the most important industry here was, he or she would probably point to the large technology firms around Dublin or the large pharmaceutical companies in Cork, but not many people recognise how important and large the aviation sector is on our island home. As the Minister of State pointed out, Ireland is a major hub for aircraft leasing across the world. Europe's largest airline, for all its imperfections, is headquartered in Ireland. Not only that, but Irish citizens dominate the boardrooms of airlines across the world from Etihad Airways to Qantas in Australia. From an Irish perspective, we are punching above our weight.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Ireland is the global hub of the airline industry, but apart from the commercial aspects, we have a major historical and societal connection with it. A little more than 100 years ago, Alcock and Brown landed in a bog in Clifden. We have had an affection for and association with the airline industry as a result. We are fascinated by it, and that is a good thing. I mention this because it is the context in which our debate should be held. Aviation is important to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> I will raise three points with the Minister of State in the time available to me. The first will relate to Aer Lingus, the second to the security and safety aspects of the sector and the third to funding options for enhancing the public sector's ability to provide the safety and security services listed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Regarding Aer Lingus, I was happy to hear the Minister of State's comments about the potential for additional support if required. I am sure she is well aware that the company is under considerable and acute financial liquidity stress, and for good reason - it is complying with the laws issued by Dáil Éireann, in that it is reducing its level of passenger transport in and out of the country. I fully understand the commercial realities, in that the State is no longer a significant or formal shareholder in the company, but I believe that we still have a financial responsibility, and definitely a moral responsibility, to its staff. Whatever the corporate arrangements, Aer Lingus is for all intents and purposes still Ireland's national carrier. Every time an aircraft with a shamrock on its tail fin lands at any airfield in the world, it is promoting and advertising Ireland. The company also flies hundreds of thousands of visitors into the country annually in a normal year, be they business leaders or just tourists coming to spend some time in Ireland. There is a symbiotic relationship between the airline and this country. Aer Lingus's survival is important from Ireland's perspective. The time for a financial intervention is here.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I was happy to hear the Minister of State's suggestion and that she has an open mind towards additional financial support. May I be so bold as to offer three suggestions that she might wish to consider? Other European countries have bailed out their national flag carriers. If it is good enough for Germany, it is certainly good enough for Ireland. Perhaps taking an equity stake in the airline is a possibility to get it through the acute financial situation it will be in over the next few months, but I appreciate the state aid constraints that might apply to a financial bailout from a loan or equity perspective. As such, I will offer two further options. It is acknowledged that the State needs a strategic aircraft to move its people around.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">It could very easily be flown by the Air Corps and it could be used on a cross-governmental basis. For instance, the Department of Foreign Affairs could use an aircraft to evacuate Irish citizens from abroad, which it has done a number of times over the past 12 months, Irish Aid could very easily use an aircraft to transport aid overseas, and the HSE could use an aircraft to pick up personal protective equipment or to move casualties from one hospital to another internationally. The State recognises, and the former Taoiseach and current Tánaiste also recognised approximately 12 months ago in the Dáil, that we need a national strategic aircraft for this purpose. If Aer Lingus has so many surplus aircraft on the ground unused at present, would it not make sense for the State to purchase one of these aircraft from it for this purpose? The stars are aligning from this point of view. We should seize the day. It is in the interests of Aer Lingus and Ireland. My question to the Minister of State is: what are we waiting for?</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> We could use Aer Lingus more effectively to rotate Irish peacekeeping troops abroad. There are three return rotation flights due between Dublin and Beirut international airport in the next three months. I cannot remember the last time Aer Lingus was used to rotate Irish troops. This would be a wonderful opportunity to provide some liquidity support to Aer Lingus via commercial means. Instead of Irish troops being flown home by unreliable airlines that do not have the same reliability or punctuality requirements, Aer Lingus should certainly be used if at all possible. Even in the short term, if it cannot be used to rotate Irish troops from Beirut in the next three months perhaps we could look at entering a longer-term service level agreement over a five- to ten-year time horizon, whereby Aer Lingus could be used preferentially to rotate our peacekeeping troops. It could be paid upfront to provide this service. These are three suggestions with regard to Aer Lingus that the Minister of State might wish to consider. Obviously she will have to discuss the matter with her Defence Cabinet colleagues, namely, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, and the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. I would be grateful for the Minister of State's thoughts on these suggestions, perhaps when she wraps up next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The next broad theme I would like to discuss is with regard to the comments in the Bill on safety and security. It is a major issue for the country because there is an obligation on every nation state to be able to police its land, territorial waters and airspace. With regard to policing our airspace we are hugely negligent. There is a major gap in our security from this perspective. It is probably something we should look at filling, particularly when we are discussing it with regard to the Bill. We have no primary military grade radar. We are unique in Europe as of the EU 27 we are the only country that does not have this capability and it needs to be addressed. We do have secondary civilian radar but once the transponder of an aircraft is turned off we have no sight and no visibility with regard to where it is. Not only is it a flight security issue, it is certainly also a flight safety issue that needs to be addressed. There is a commitment in the 2015 White Paper on defence to purchase a primary radar system for the country but we have yet to see one materialise. Perhaps it is something the Minister of State might wish to discuss with her Cabinet colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> We have no intercept and escort capability whatsoever. It is just ourselves and Malta in Europe that do not have this capability. If an unidentified aircraft, a hijacked aircraft, a rogue aircraft or a smuggling type aircraft enters Irish airspace we have no means whatsoever to intercept it and escort it through our service. This is a major deficiency. Quite frankly, it is fairly humiliating that we have to use the Royal Air Force in a secret agreement to provide that service. It is a secret agreement for a reason because it is probably unconstitutional and if it were tested in the courts it would probably be found to be so. This is an area on which we have to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> With regard to personnel in the public service who are involved in safety and security from an airspace perspective, we have no Air Corps reserve. We have an Army Reserve and a Naval Service Reserve but we have no Air Corps reserve due to an historic anomaly. I hope this is something the commission on defence could look at when it makes its report later this year. However, of the 15 people on the commission on defence not one has a background in aviation. This is a blind spot from the commission's perspective that I hope will be addressed by putting on an additional member in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> The next major theme I want to discuss is the funding model we could use to enhance the safety and security of our airspace. The first option is very simple and straightforward, which is to increase the defence Vote. I am very happy to see the defence budget was increased by €32 million this year for 2021. I still have no sight or visibility on where that money will be spent but certainly an investment in the safety and security of our airspace would be a good starting point. Where the Department of Transport comes in is that the Irish Aviation Authority charges navigational fees for every aircraft that travels through Irish airspace and makes a profit of approximately €20 million to €30 million in a normal year without a pandemic. I would be grateful for the Minister of State's thoughts on whether this money could be ring-fenced to support our airspace services. It is the same principle as a toll bridge. People who drive on an Irish motorway pay a toll charge and this money is used to offset the initial investment cost and it is also used for maintenance. It makes sense if we are taxing aircraft that travel through our airspace that the tax is used to protect the aircraft, from a service and security point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Is there any way the Department of Transport could eliminate or reduce excess costs? This is where the search and rescue contract comes in. The company that provides helicopter services to the Coast Guard at present is providing an excellent service and there are wonderful people on board. The problem with the contract is that it is really expensive. For the past ten years it has cost approximately €600 million and negotiations are ongoing for another ten-year period from 2023, which could cost up to €1 billion because it will most likely include fixed wing and rotary wing assets. It does not make any sense to invest in a private international firm to provide helicopters for a fixed period of time. It would make much more sense to internalise this capability into a sovereign service provided either by the Coast Guard or the Air Corps. The Air Corps should be tasked with providing this service from 2023 onwards and any gaps the Air Corps cannot meet could very easily be outsourced. A bill of €1 billion is massive. It is equivalent of half the cost of a children's hospital and at the end of the ten years we will have absolutely nothing to show for it. My suggestion, and I give it freely, is to invest in our public services to provide this service rather than to outsource it to an international firm that does not need the additional revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I thank the Minister of State for hearing me out. I will definitely support the Bill as it goes through the Oireachtas. It is something of which I am very much in favour. The issues I covered included financial support for Aer Lingus, if at all possible. The commercial case alone is compelling, let alone the economic case for Ireland. I also mentioned the fact we need to upgrade our airspace safety and security capacity. This needs to be done as soon as possible. I also explored some funding models to take the edge off this cost and make sure it is affordable from Ireland's point of view.</p>

        <speech by="#MattShanahan" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Deputy Matt Shanahan<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_666">I welcome the opportunity to support the passage of the Bill. Institutional reform and restructuring of aviation policy is probably well overdue in this country. I was a member of the Covid committee and we spent quite a number of modules hearing from the aviation sector. We know the crisis in the sector due to Covid and it does not look like there will be any resolution of it soon. I know the Department is probably focused on this and I echo the calls of all Deputies seeking funding and additional grant aid for the airlines as well as to the airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Perhaps in the overall aviation sector it is now time to look again at the idea of what is in the programme for Government with regard to regional economic rebalancing in the aviation sector. I am thinking in particular of Waterford airport. The south-east regional airport has been awaiting funding for some time for an extension of the runway so we can accommodate jet traffic. We will certainly need it when the economy is opened up again so we can start to revitalise our tourism offering and business supports in Waterford and the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">As Deputy Berry has just mentioned it, I would also like to highlight Rescue 117, which is the funded helicopter service operated by CHC Helicopter for air-sea rescue in the south east. It does tremendous work, particularly in the south-east region. Not only is it tasked with trying to monitor our shorelines but it also does a large number of patient transfers, and has carried out transfers to the UK through the children's hospital. I would like to give a big shout out to Rescue 117. It is supported at Waterford Airport and I hope the funding going into that area in the future will be increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> As for what other Deputies have said, we can all lament that we no longer have a nationally-funded public carrier. We know the trials of Aer Lingus as part of the International Airlines Group, IAG, and Ryanair, as big as it is, certainly is feeling the great difficulty that exists like everybody else. I hope the Government can step in. Other Deputies referred to the amount of state aid given by other countries in the EU and state aid rules have been relaxed in order to support services. This is something the Minister and the Department need to consider becoming active on pretty soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> In that light, another look at the importance of the aviation sector is needed. If I recall the figure that was given to me at recent presentations, it makes up about 10% of the economic component of the country when it is fleshed out through the individual services, employment and tourism, because many people travel in and out of the country using air services. Financial aircraft leasing is very big business, as the Minister mentioned, and for years Ireland has been at the absolute centre of global aircraft leasing. Tourism and hospitality are areas in which I and many others have concerns as to how quickly the economy is going to recover and how quickly we can re-establish low-cost fares, which have been the basis of a huge amount of our tourism in recent years. There is now the potential for fare increases and some redundancy of aircraft. I also believe we can soon expect green charges on fuel, which will add to fare costs. Again, I ask the question as to what level of financial supports will be coming from Government to offset those.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> With regard to some of the things we could be doing in aviation leadership, I come back to the issue of a pilot training school. We certainly had such a school in Waterford years ago but I am not aware of any specific school now and while there are early pilot training schools, they do not operate to a commercial level and most students have to go to America to finish their training. Now, with modern technology, this is something we should be looking at and trying to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> With regard to the Defence Forces, what role will this regulator play in regard to future air defence policy and coastline surveillance using the Air Corps?</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I also wish to point to an area of development that is coming fast, namely, drone technology and using drones in the area of logistics, as well as in regard to defence and surveillance. Again, this is something to which the Department needs to be alive. There is no reason that Ireland, as we have done in many other areas previously, cannot become a global leader in pursuing some of this technology and some of the ideals of drone technology, which is going to be a ubiquitous service very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I hope we can retain our role in global aircraft leasing and I hope the Government will be forthcoming on all of that. I seek an understanding of where, with the passage of this Bill, the authority will intersect with this activity in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> As other Deputies have mentioned, there is horrendous economic pain in the aircraft and aviation sectors with families who are challenged through unemployment and through furlough. Although I am not a Deputy representing Dublin, I am getting quite a number of representations from people who are struggling as their jobs in aviation have been furloughed and they are having great difficulty. This is something about which the Minister can talk to the Departments of Finance and Social Protection to make sure people are tided over. It is very difficult to go from a very high-paying job to a very low-paying support overnight, with all of the costs people incur. We have to remember, as public servants, that we do not suffer those situations but people in the private sector do. I ask the Minister to have a look at that with other Ministers.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_676">I am happy to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation on the basis that I once learned to fly aeroplanes and also flew in them. I learned to ride motorbikes as well, but I have to confess I did not fly on a motorbike.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> It is important legislation. Regulation and health and safety are issues we need to be aware of and have been aware of since the foundation of the State. There was a reason for that. We were there at the beginning of aviation, and we have a right and a duty to continue on that role that we have inherited. We were there at the beginning because we were the last post <i>en route</i> across the Atlantic to the United States, and we were the first post in terms of touchdown on the early flights in reverse. Therefore, we need to realise it is important to update our legislation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> From a health and safety point of view, and I want to emphasise that aspect, our aviation charts and maps and GPS charts need to be updated on a regular basis to ensure that pilots can rely with absolute certainty on what they see before them, and that they do not have to make a split-second decision that could have been made at their leisure had the adequate facilities been before them. One thing I do from time to time, especially in the past six months or so, is to look at the facts surrounding various aviation crashes, the way in which the investigation surrounds the pilot and the way pilot error is sought for as a means of offloading responsibility when the time comes. Very few people know what is like unless they are at the coalface, as we all know in regard to other contexts at the present time. There may not be sufficient time to take appropriate action as a result of inadequate information and I can think of at least one instance where that was the cause of an accident in the fairly recent past. Obviously, if the charts and GPS had been updated, that would not have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> We also have to cover the area of regulation, which is important. Regulation in respect of health and safety and operational issues must be borne in mind and kept to the fore at all times. Otherwise, standards will fall and accidents will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> We also need to update our governance. The governance in the airline sector all over the globe has changed in recent years, in that various airlines have collapsed and have had to be bailed out by governments. I congratulate our own airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, for the work they have done and the way have managed so far in very difficult circumstances. While I would not always agree with the views of the Ryanair boss as to when international travel should be restored, it is a fact that Ryanair has done a great deal for the development of the aviation industry and for the provision of readily available transport at an economic rate, which was not available 30 or 40 years ago. Similarly, I want to congratulate Aer Lingus for its work and recognise that there are issues and challenges for it now as well. What we need to do is be fair and equal in the way we deal with our air carriers and to try to ensure that a level playing pitch is provided for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> The present is as good a time as any to refine the legislation affecting the industry. It is the time and place to do it when the number of aircraft in the skies is at its lowest. I congratulate the Minister for bringing the legislation before the House at this moment, although others may have different views on that. People may say that we could postpone this as we have more urgent issues. However, at some stage, everything becomes urgent.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">We should not wait until it becomes urgent before we deal with particular issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_683"> The aviation industry is going through a very testing time. It will require all the encouragement, help and fair play that can be given to it. It will recover again and quickly when the time comes but we still do not know when the Covid threat will pass or if things will ever be the same again. We must realise that we must live with what we have got and ensure that the next generation has something to inherit. </p>
          <p eId="para_684"> I do not live close to any of the airports but I do live on the flight path of aeroplanes to Dublin Airport. I am conscious of the experiences of people in that constituency in regard to noise. From my experience, windows and doors are the main areas through which the noise comes into the house. They can be insulated or treated with double or treble protection to deflect aircraft noise and it is very successful. There is a huge difference between the double and treble protection, which leaves only the noise from the chimneys and that can also be reduced dramatically. The Minister ought to keep those issues in mind. A certain amount of discomfort follows but we have to deal with progress. Progress has been ongoing for years, we have led the field and hopefully will continue to do so. </p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_685">The Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 creates a single aviation regulator for safety, security, economic regulation and consumer protection. It is something with which I am in full agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Last April I raised rapid testing at airports with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and have repeatedly raised it since. That is going back nine or ten months ago and I was very disappointed that no Deputy in Cork supported my call. I was involved in a meeting with Cork Airport when I raised it there. I find it unbelievable that it is only in the last while that we are talking about testing in our airports. Not one person should be able to enter or leave our islands without a negative PCR test. It is very simple testing and should have been mandatory from the very start. Every aircraft route that leaves Ireland will represent lost jobs and lost GDP. It is an economic fact that if our airlines are allowed to go out of business, the consequences for the Irish economy will be devastating. Cork South-West relies on tourism for a huge part of our economy. When the pandemic is over we will need our tourists back and for Cork Airport to be brought up to full strength as it was before. Most Governments across the world have recognised such dangers and have accepted that if they should intervene in airline operations for the sake of the virus suppression, then they must ensure that those airlines do not go out of business as a result. New Zealand, so often our favourite Covid comparator, moved quickly to extend supports worth €900 million to Air New Zealand. Much closer to home, the list includes Air France, British Airways and Air Portugal to the tune of €7 billion, €2.5 billion and €1.2 billion, respectively. The UK Government provided a loan worth €670 million to Ryanair, an Irish airline, such was the value it placed on its contribution to the UK economy. Why does Ireland remain an outlier as the only European country to not provide meaningful financial support to its indigenous airlines? The window for decisive action is fast closing. Airlines plan and budget for the vitally important summer schedule at this time of year and will soon have to make hard decisions based on expected market conditions. The Government needs to understand that creditors and airline owners will not allow for yet another summer. They will cut their losses and move their money and assets to other countries that support aviation. The market will not save Ireland's airlines. If international travel must be suppressed into the future then significant financial support for Irish airlines is the only option to avert the sector's collapse. If the Government intervenes to suppress travel, it must also act to save our airlines from destruction. It cannot have it both ways. The Government needs to provide meaningful financial support to Ireland's airlines before it is too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> I will also raise the way in which some of the airlines have acted towards their employees, something I raised when the CEO of Aer Lingus was before the Covid-19 response committee. I asked about people's basic social welfare rights. Many employees were unfortunately in a situation where they might have a day or two of work a week but not much more than that. At the time, Aer Lingus was refusing to sign off on the Xs and Os, unlike other employers. Maybe it is above the people, I do not know, but it is looking for supports to survive. On that occasion, its representatives promised they would come back to me to provide full clarity on their intentions towards their employees but I never heard anything since. That is seven or eight months ago and I am very frustrated because at the same time, the airline expects the nation to support it.  I stress the importance of Cork and Shannon airports, as well as Dublin. Cork Airport is very important to tourism in west Cork, places such as Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Kinsale, Bandon, down to the Sheep's Head, Mizen Head and the Bere Peninsula. People fly into Cork Airport to holiday in these beauty spots. We will return to that day soon again but we need to support our airports to ensure that they are on a firm footing, ready to go back to the way they were prior to this Covid disaster. I would appreciate if all supports that can be given to Cork Airport are given to it in the future. Any support we can provide to the Government within the Dáil to ensure this will be given. </p>

          <p eId="para_688">I am very happy to speak on the important matter of connectivity with the rest of the world. I wish the Minister of State well with her brief and thank her and the senior Minister. I will be speaking to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on a meeting on Zoom tomorrow that I requested, about issues in Tipperary town, which I appreciate.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> The aviation industry is very important. People can criticise Ryanair and its chief executive's style but it did transform the industry and introduced competition into it. People were able to go away to holidays in places that they never dreamed of because of competition. We need competition; it is the spice of life. I also salute Aer Lingus. I have travelled a few times with it but not that many. I had a fierce fear of flying for years but once I took to the skies, it grew on me. It has been a wonderful promoter of Ireland, think of their green shamrocks and badges, and the air stewards and pilots. Consider the expense and efforts that the pilots take to get trained but many simply have been abandoned recently. Many pilots in Tipperary and beyond have contacted me who are just in limbo. As Deputy Michael Collins mentioned, in the early part of the pandemic, for some reason Aer Lingus was kicking and screaming and would not allow its staff to sign on and off days, which normal businesses do all the time with different seasonal jobs and otherwise. They should have allowed that. I was privileged to be at the Taoiseach's briefings when we had them with NPHET and the rest of them. I asked them from the very first meeting, like a bad record, why we were not doing something about testing with our airports. They are welded to this PCR test. I have issues with the PCR test, as do many scientists and medical people who know a lot more than me about it. Some samples have been spun around for too many revolutions in tests in this country. I saw somewhere recently that the WHO has warned people to turn down the revolution cycle of tests. Why was the antigen test refused and not allowed? It is nearly a year into the situation. We must have the antigen testing as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> There is also the issue of many Irish people abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Many of them are away for business and they cannot come home. It is easy to look for the complete closure of the airports but essential travel will always have to take place. I refer to travel for business or health reasons and medical people who want to come in and out of the country. There are even those who come here to repair medical equipment but only a small amount of that takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> I was on to the Department recently, as was a constituent of mine. In terms of transmitting Covid, there are two ways one is safe to travel. Uimhir a haon is a negative Covid test within three days and uimhir a dó is a recent history of Covid and recovery from Covid certified by a medical doctor. We have to look at that because the number of people who got Covid, were sick and have recovered is huge. Of course, we never hear that on RTÉ or any of the media. Thankfully, many people recover well. Although the science is not settled on the length of immunity having had Covid and recovering from it, it is accepted that a minimum safe period in which one can expect immunity to last is 90 days. It may last for years but we do not know that yet. For this reason, the second criterion of certified recovery from Covid is obviously the most reliable. That should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> In terms of the USA criteria, they state that effective from 26 January, all airline passengers travelling to the United States aged two years or older must provide a negative Covid-19 viral test taken within three calendar days of travel. Alternatively, travellers to the US may provide documentation from a licensed healthcare provider of having recovered from Covid-19 in the 90 days preceding travel. I would think that person would be a GP or other doctor, so why can we not do that? Why do we have to dance on the head of a pin in this regard? If we did that we would not be wasting money on tests. The PCR test costs €190. They might be a little cheaper now but it is hard to find that out. If one has recovered from Covid and has a certificate to that effect, one should be able to travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> People who had Covid, recovered and are now immune may still test positive but in their case it is an additional sign of immunity and safety, not a warning sign. People who initially contact Covid were in an infectious cycle from the very start but these people have recovered. Ireland recognises only one criterion for entrance into the country, that is, a negative Covid test within three days of arrival. This means that people who have had Covid, are immune and can legally travel for legitimate and sensible reasons cannot come home. That is what I referred to at the start of my contribution. They might be working in Dubai or God knows where. We have engineers working all over the world. Some of our brightest and best people work all over the world in a wide range of industries and commerce. That is the reason they should be allowed to come home. It is very hard on those people coming up to nearly 12 months of this pandemic if they cannot get home. As I said to the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs, this is a big problem in that people who are now immune to Covid are stranded all over the world as a result of the shortfall in the Irish regulations. We must look at that because if it is good enough for Americans, who are fairly strict, it should be good enough for us. </p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Our policy on aviation also contradicts the HSE advice which, after a positive test, tells one the number of days to isolate and the date on which one can move freely again. The Cabinet seems to want to be seen to be very strict but this anomaly and shortfall in the regulations is preventing people from trying to come home. While this may be seen to be anti-science, it is not a case of being anti-science. Moreover, it is not anti-vaccination or anything else. I ask the Minister why the Irish travel restrictions do not recognise the status of citizens who have had Covid, recovered, have proof of same and immunity for 90 days. The proof of same is a medical certification. When will the Government stop penalising those who have had Covid and recovered and allow them to come home? If we are going to live with Covid, which we are told we have to do, we will have to support the people who recover from it. There are many of them and they need to be able to have that test to come home. </p>
          <p eId="para_696"> We have to think outside the box. I know we are talking about aviation and connectivity but NPHET must examine this. I have said frequently that NPHET needs to be expanded and new people need to be brought in from different areas. The airlines are so important to us for our connectivity. I salute a group of people from Ireland and all over the world who went off and bought an airline. They call it the Freedom airline. I am not trying to pick on people who are down or weak in other countries but the Government should be looking at buying airlines, which are being sold for a pittance. It is a pity but we must preserve our airlines. We must preserve our connectivity. Another competitor in Ireland would not do one bit of harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Dublin Airport is bonkers every time I am there, albeit not for the past nine months. I refer to investment in Dublin Airport. I spoke at length on the Bill the former Minister, Deputy Ross, was bringing through the House about the downgrading of Shannon, Cork, Waterford - Port Láirge, Galway and Knock airports. We have plenty of airports. We need more aeroplanes and more pilots. We have many young ambitious people who would like to become pilots. I will not list them but I have read out the figures. Governments all over the world have pumped massive amounts of money - billions in some cases - into airlines and we will not give them pingin amháin. Cén fáth? What are we trying to do? Are we trying to get rid of them, like so many other businesses in Ireland, and hire people to come in and run our airlines? We have had the proud flag of Aer Lingus for many decades and we have the competitor, Ryanair, also. We need to support them and, as far as I am concerned, we need a third airline. We need to open up in that regard. When the late Charlie Haughey and the late Monsignor Horan wanted to develop Knock, what did Enda Kenny and others say? A Fine Gael Minister at the time called it a fog in a bog or something like that but the airport is there. It is a fine international airport but it is under capacity. Cork and Shannon airports are under capacity. Some airlines pulled out of Cork and Shannon, although their names will not come readily to me now. It is time to look around and see what is available because money was never as cheap to borrow. In fact, it can be borrowed at an interest rate of nearly 0%. We need to invest because we need our connectivity. Our country is too small and we are seeing now the impacts of Brexit. Our people need to be able to work all over the world. We are working at jobs all over the world in good industries and helping other economies. Our NGOs travel all over the world. Our sisters and priests went as missionaries all over the world and still do. They do tremendous work, which is recognised all over the world. We might not want to recognise them at home but they are recognised all over the world, and rightly so.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> We need to think outside the box here. We need to look at supporting the airlines and at this point in time. The pilots must be supported also because they have families. They have a tough job, which involves being away and then having so much rest time when they come back. Their families have a difficult time but they must be supported now and the airlines must be supported. We are getting pleas for support every day. The Minister of State must be flooded with them. Why are we so out of kilter that we will not support our airlines? Almost every country in the world is supporting their airlines. Previous speakers said that the British Government supported Ryanair because it knew how badly it needed the connectivity. We also need it. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> We have lost railway lines. We have lost so much in rural Ireland. This is something we have and that we need to protect and enhance. We are supposed to be all in this together so we must support our airlines and make sure they will be there fit for purpose when, we hope - we had Lá Fhéile Bríde three days ago - on this third day of spring, the pandemic is over. We must look forward. This virus will not be with us always but we must examine the antigen testing. We must look at that model of people who have recovered from Covid and have a certificate to that effect. We must let them come home in the first instance but also let them travel afterwards because people who have had Covid and recovered must be allowed to live. Everyone else is cocooning and frightened to go here or there or do anything but the people who have gone through it must be allowed back into the economy. Otherwise, our economy will not last. </p>
          <p eId="para_700"> In a few weeks' time, we will have been in this scenario for 12 months. I reiterate that we must look around to see if there are airlines out there or if we have any enterprising entrepreneurs who would be able to buy them and have them ready. They are there and they are well equipped. They are the best of aeroplanes. The orders for Boeing and other aeroplanes were massive. The books were full. Everything is stopped now but if the ones that are sitting in hangars at airports are available and cheap, they should be bought.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> With regard to connectivity, Waterford Airport needs upgrading badly, and we need support for it. In terms of Shannon Airport, we have a group in which Deputies Cathal Crowe, McNamara and Carey are involved. We have had many meetings, as Shannon is facing a real problem. We must discourage all the traffic flying into Dublin and divert it down to the country airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I am not anti-Dublin but the city is choked and Terminal 2 is full. There is now a plan for massive extensions there again and we know the views of residents about it. Some of them contacted me about noise when we had this debate with the previous Minister, former Deputy Shane Ross. It is not nice. I heard Deputy Durkan say people could close windows if they are double-glazed or triple-glazed but somebody will not stay there in summer with the windows closed. What happens if the people want to sit in or dig in their back garden? As the current Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, might say, there might be some south-facing window boxes in which people might grow some lettuce.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The Minister needs to forget about the lettuce and get serious about developing our economy and airlines. Most of all we must support the pilots. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí; we should encourage more young people to go into pilot training. Deputy Durkan said he took up flying at one stage, which I did not know. I knew he often drove a tractor but I did not think he got into the air. I would be afraid to try flying but the world should be their oyster for young people. When this is over, it should remain their oyster. There are training schools that are ready for investment. Above all, the Minister of State must tell us in her response why funding is not being put into aviation. It is going into private hospitals and a certain beef mogul who owns private hospitals. It is going into Citywest and God knows where else. These are exceptional times but we cannot cut off our connectivity with the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The Taoiseach wants to go to America and our diaspora is abroad. There are people abroad who have recovered from Covid-19, including people from here who are working abroad. They cannot come home. Fair play is fine play with me. The Taoiseach is going to America to encourage thousands of tourists to come here. President Biden is telling us now he is mad about Mayo and Louth and will come here. The tourists will come here but they cannot do so if we do not have proper infrastructure in our airports and aircraft. Above all, they will not come here if we do not have the human resource of pilots, back-up staff, technicians, hostesses and everybody else. It is a big industry and needs major support. It must get this support and it cannot wait much longer for it. We do not want the industry to be diminished in such a way that it will not be there when we are ready to go again.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the Second Stage debate. I will endeavour to answer as many questions as I can. I will certainly address any remaining matters on Committee Stage. I welcome the support of Deputies for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I will come back to Deputy O'Rourke and some of his questions seeking further information on matters such as costs. They will be kept to a minimum and it is something on which the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, board and senior management are focused. There has been regular engagement between my Department and Fórsa, the main staff union for the IAA and the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, as well as between the company and the staff representatives. The Bill is quite clear that staff terms and conditions will not be affected by any institutional changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> As I alluded to in my introductory remarks, this important legislation brings together a number of different strands of policy into a single comprehensive Bill to create an independent and strengthened aviation regulator. The recovery to an internationally competitive and sustainable aviation industry needs a strong and reputable regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The proposed institutional reforms contained in the Bill will create a single national aviation regulator responsible for safety, security and economic regulation. In order to do this, the regulatory functions of the IAA and the CAR will be combined. The Bill will also separate the for-profit air traffic control services functions of the IAA and place them in a newly formed commercial semi-State company, which will be called the Irish air navigation service. One of the most important consequences of the Bill is that it will bring to an end to the dual commercial and regulator role of the IAA.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important topic.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> This State has expended enormous amounts of money as aids to businesses affected by the pandemic, and rightly so. The purpose of this has been to preserve businesses and jobs affected by the pandemic. More important is ensuring that as many businesses and jobs as possible emerge unscathed when the pandemic is over and the country begins to reopen. It seems that despite the billions of euro in expenditure, there is still one missing ingredient that would make that expenditure infinitely more effective than it otherwise might be.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> I came across the amazing statistic recently that the number of insolvencies in this country between 2019 and 2020 only rose by 1%. This blunt fact masks a different position. Many companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises and those at the lower end of that sector, are surviving in a zombie-like state, propped up by State supports and debt forbearance. This raises the bleak and frightening prospect of a tsunami of redundancies, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses, once these props are withdrawn. As I have said, the Government has already spent billions of euro on keeping those businesses afloat. For every one of them that goes under, a part of that money will have been lost or wasted, if one were to put it like that.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> Under the examinership system, which was put in place in 1990 and amended in the Companies Act 2014, companies in financial difficulty can avoid going into liquidation by adopting a programme of restructuring accepted by creditors and agreed by the court. Two of every three examinerships succeed, thereby enabling thousands of jobs and livelihoods to be saved. However, only a very small number of SMEs have been able to use the examinership process, simply because the costs are prohibitive due to the fact that the matter must be agreed and subsequently supervised before being signed off by the High Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> There was an amendment to the legislation to enable certain types of companies to use the Circuit Court but, unfortunately, that has not given rise to an uptake in the number of SMEs and small companies applying for examinership. In cases where the matter was dealt with by the Circuit Court outside Dublin, the costs proved higher than they would have been if the High Court had been the relevant forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> A new, affordable system specifically tailored to the needs of SMEs must be established urgently and be in place before the pandemic supports and debt forbearance come to an end. A model has been proposed by the company law advisory group and it was published on 22 October last. A version of what was recommended by the group must be passed into law urgently. If such a system is in place when debt forbearance and the artificial State props that applied during the pandemic come to an end, thousands of jobs that may otherwise be lost may be saved. Something similar has been done in the UK, although the model is not exactly appropriate to this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">It is not a question of reinventing the wheel. I am raising this to stress the urgency of the matter and to ask the Minister of State when we can expect to see the legislation to implement the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RobertTroy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_223">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Robert Troy)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_724">The State's longstanding preventative restructuring framework, examinership, is internationally recognised and has proven to be a successful tool for restructuring in its current form. However, the impact of Covid-19 on business has necessitated a review of the existing restructuring process, provided for by the Companies Act 2014, to determine whether it meets the needs of businesses as they respond to the economic impact of the pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> It has generally been acknowledged that small companies encounter particular challenges in availing of examinership. The associated costs pose a significant barrier to access. Covid-19 continues to disrupt economic activity and may eventually give rise to increased numbers of companies in difficulty. While there will be companies among that cohort which should be properly wound up and cease trading, there will also be many companies with viable business models that are capable of being rescued. Small companies employ in the region of 788,000 people across the country, and contribute significantly to our economy. It is in our economic interest that those companies which are fundamentally viable have an opportunity to restructure and access an appropriate rescue process. The programme for Government contains a commitment in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> For these reasons, in July 2020 the CLRG was requested to consider the issue of rescue for small business as a priority. The CLRG is a statutory advisory body charged with advising the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on matters relating to company law. Its membership is broad and representative of key stakeholders in the area, such as Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, the Revenue Commissioners, insolvency and legal practitioners and regulators, making it uniquely well-positioned to provide an informed view on the matter. The CLRG completed its work within an accelerated timeframe, reporting back on 24 October 2020, as acknowledged by Deputy O'Dea. The report sets out a number of policy options for a proposed new process for the rescue of small companies, a summary rescue process which would be distinct from the existing statutory examinership process.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> The issue of company rescue extends far beyond the distressed company and impacts on all creditors, which are often other small companies. Any new framework must reflect the delicate balance between sometimes competing stakeholders and provide sufficiently robust safeguards for the protection of creditors, in particular, employees and other small companies. I am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by small companies in our country and I am fully committed to progressing legislation to support their long-term viability and preserve employment. The recommendations contained within the CLRG report have been under active consideration by the officials in my Department. They have made proposals to me on responding to the report and progressing any necessary legislation as soon as is practical. My aim is to have the legislation in place by summer at the latest and ideally, as Deputy O'Dea mentioned, before the supports currently in place cease to be in operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">I thank the Minister of State very much for his assurance that it is his intention to have the legislation to provide a system of examinership or restructuring, or whatever one wants to call it, specifically tailored to the needs of these companies in place by summer at the latest. That is most appropriate. If it is done, the necessary addendum to all the money that has been spent on those supports will be in place. I have one question for the Minister of State. I read the report of the CLRG and I note that there were certain fundamental matters on which there were fairly robust differences of opinion. Will the Minister of State take very careful account of those members of the CLRG whose opinion was that it is absolutely essential and critical that in any new system of examinership or rescue, such as is being proposed, the question of an automatic stay of execution in relation to creditors proceeding to put the company into insolvency should apply from a very early date? This could be possibly from the date on which the directors decide on this course of action or, at worst, from the date of the meeting of the creditors and shareholders approving that course of action. Second, will the Minister of State provide me with an assurance that whatever form the legislation takes, and we will have to debate it in depth, it will try to keep these matters as far away from the courts as possible, so that referral to, and involvement of, the courts will be very much a last resort?</p>

            <p eId="para_729">What I will say is that the proposed new process for the rescue of small companies, the summary rescue process, will be very much distinct from the existing statutory examinership process. That is our intention. We intend to put the proposal out for public consultation. That will happen imminently. We certainly welcome the views and suggestions of all parties on how we move it forward. We are acutely aware that it must be done swiftly. As Deputy O'Dea said, when supports to businesses inevitably taper off as the restrictions lift, we want to ensure that as many sustainable businesses as is practically possible are protected and enabled to restructure in a timely and efficient fashion. That option is not currently available to them and I want to change that. It is my intention and that of the Department to move this process along as swiftly as possible. Obviously, that is partly in our control and partly outside of our control, for example, in the case of pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas committees. I hope that all parties in the House will see the benefit of ensuring robust legislation is in place in this regard and that they will welcome it in order that we can advance this matter without further delay. There will be further engagement with stakeholders in the next number of weeks and we can move the process on from there.</p>

            <p eId="para_731"> Wilker Auto Conversions, based in Clara, County Offaly, last night informed 80 members of a workforce of approximately 100 of its intention to temporarily close its facility owing to components from the UK that it needs to complete work on its line being delayed at customs and ports. The company produces excellent products, which are primarily used in the ambulance sector. It services the HSE, among other public services in Ireland and the UK. It is the largest company engaged in this type of auto conversion in Ireland and the UK. The company's decision was shocking for staff, their families and their communities and our immediate concern is for them. An assurance was immediately sought from management that it would meet trade unions and assure the workforce, via the unions, of its commitment to the welfare and rights of its workforce and to finding options that may pertain to their income over the intervening period. That assurance was forthcoming.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> The issue at hand is of great concern. It is one of the first cases of temporary job losses, with the potential further losses, arising from the implications of Brexit. It is not as if this company was ill-prepared. It had employed outside expertise to assist in ensuring it was in a position to meet demands placed on it as a result of Brexit. It would appear that that is not necessarily the same for UK companies that trade with Irish firms. This is a very worrying trend that needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> I welcome the Minister of State to the House and acknowledge the absence of the Minister for Finance, who could not be here today.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">There are obligations on Government in a cross-departmental capacity in this area, whether it be the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Transport, or Foreign Affairs, and in respect of Revenue and Customs and Excise. The issues and difficulties that have arisen because of the unfortunate error on the part of the EU last weekend, when it sought to invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol, opened the door for many people north of the Border to raise issues in regard to the east-west trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. That has led to conciliation talks in an effort to resolve the issues, involving officials from the relevant Departments and officials from the EU and the UK. I hope and expect that the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, can bring to bear on those who are representing this country in those talks and negotiations to investigate also the issues that have arisen as a result of the case I have raised and many other similar ones that are brewing, if they have not already brewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> My immediate ask is that the relevant Departments converse with the company in question, identify the issues at hand and work with other Departments to ensure that an effort is made to smooth the pathway to resolving those issues. We all feared the implications of Brexit. It was never going to be easy and the ramifications were always going to be there. This is one such ramification and it is of grave concern to me and my constituents. I want to be able to assure them that every effort is being made by our officials to ensure that this process is eased.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_736">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. Like him, our thoughts are with the families in his constituency who are facing an uncertain time at the moment. The Deputy will be aware that the tax and customs affairs of any business are confidential and there is a duty of confidentially imposed on Revenue in this regard by virtue of section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Accordingly, Revenue cannot comment on, and cannot provide me with details in regard to, the particular case that is the subject of the Deputy's concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> However, Revenue has provided some general information that should be helpful to the Deputy in understanding the general situation as regards customs formalities and how they might apply in the case he has raised. Normally, import duties, including customs duty and VAT, are payable at the point of entry of goods into the EU from a third country. In such a situation of a direct import into Ireland from a non-EU country, the import duties would be payable at the point of importation unless alternative procedures have been put in place as agreed with Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> As regards alternative procedures and as a way of supporting and encouraging trade and business, there are a number of customs procedures and authorisations which may be availed of whereby the payment of import duties can be suspended. An example would be where goods are imported and subject to certain modifications or alterations before they are either re-exported from the EU or released into free circulation on the European market. The suspension of the requirement to pay import duties is an important support for business, especially in the type of scenario I outlined, where there is a time lag between importation of the goods and their eventual circulation on the market after any alteration or modification.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> To avail of any customs simplification process and to be able to defer the payment of duties, a business must apply to, and be approved by, Revenue for such a simplification. I am advised by Revenue that engagement with businesses on such a basis is a regular part of its engagement with trade and business. I am also aware that Revenue would have encouraged businesses to consider the relevance of such simplification to their business in the lead-up to 1 January 2021, as part of an approach to mitigate the impacts of the UK leaving the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> To avail of the type of simplified procedure I have outlined, a business must have the appropriate authorisation from Revenue. An application for such authorisation is made electronically and Revenue reviews the material supplied by the business to ensure that it meets the EU requirements and qualifies for the procedure. Depending on the level of complexity of the processing in Ireland, this can take some time and may require additional information from the business. In such instances, there may be ongoing engagement between Revenue and the business before the authorisation is awarded. In order to secure the authorisation, a financial security in the form of a comprehensive guarantee is also required.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> I am further advised by Revenue that a retrospective authorisation may be issued in exceptional circumstances. Details of such circumstances should be submitted by the trader to Revenue, which will examine and make a decision on whether they meet the EU criteria for granting retrospection. The benefit of retrospection is that any customs duty or import VAT paid by the trader on goods imported under the inward-processing authorisation may be refunded.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> In summary, authorisation for simplified customs procedures is very much a support and help that is available to business, but the facility to suspend the payment of import duties is a significant one. Revenue must ensure that the authorisation is appropriate and, once approved, covered by an appropriate level of financial guarantee. I am assured by Revenue that it actively engages with all applicants and is conscious of the importance of bringing such matters to finality as quickly as possible. Revenue has confirmed to me that it is actively engaged with the business identified by Deputy Cowen and its advisers on the current matter. </p>

            <p eId="para_743">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I particularly welcome his final sentence indicating that the Department is in direct contact with the company in question. I am reminded of a communication I received from the Taoiseach early in January, having raised issues around this matter when other companies highlighted to me the difficulties they had with the new regime, notwithstanding the efforts and the commitments they made on foot of Government advice in advance of Brexit. The Taoiseach indicated at that time that his office was engaging extensively with stakeholders and businesses across all Departments and agencies to support businesses to continue to trade and to resolve any issues that might arise as quickly as possible. He indicated that our feedback in this area was particularly helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_744"> I acknowledge the commitment made by the Minister of State on this matter. I expect that the response and engagement will be in line with the thrust of what was contained in the correspondence that was given to me earlier this year, which acknowledged the impact of the new regime and the way in which different Departments can come together to assist companies to overcome difficulties. It was also stated in that correspondence that the Government very much welcomed the conclusion of the EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement ensuring quota-free and tariff-free trade between the EU and the UK, which would mitigate the additional impact of a no-deal Brexit. The correspondence stated that this agreement, together with the withdrawal agreement and the protocol for Ireland and Northern Ireland, meant that Ireland's key Brexit objectives had now been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> In a few short weeks, unfortunately, that has been brought into question by the error we are told was made by the Commission in regard to its communication last week, where it inadvertently sought to invoke Article 16 of the protocol. That in itself has caused difficulties. I again ask that in the context of the discussions that are taking place around the whole area of trade between our two countries <i>vis-à-vis</i> the agreement that has been reached, that every effort be made to accommodate the additional difficulties that have arisen. I welcome the commitment the Minister of State has given in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">Deputy Cowen is right that there have been challenges since 1 January. There were always going to be challenges. We are moving to a new trading arrangement, with new requirements that many businesses have not had to deal with in generations. In that context, there have been interdepartmental meetings on a daily basis since the beginning of January. That has now gone down to every two or three days as some of the challenges have been addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> The Irish Road Haulage Association has raised issues in terms of the challenges its members are facing in getting product from the UK to Ireland. I understand it had a very productive meeting with senior officials in Revenue last week, who have given an undertaking to explore what further flexibilities can be enabled. I know that Revenue's systems have gone down on a number of occasions, particularly at peak times, because there has been so much traffic. That is very regrettable. I have spoken to senior Revenue officials today and they are trying to ensure it is addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">In acknowledgement of that, they announced yesterday further administrative easements to assist businesses challenged by this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> To return to the company in question, which Deputy Cowen highlighted, Enterprise Ireland supports to help businesses get Brexit ready are available to it. Enterprise Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners are engaging with the company. With regard to any company trading with the UK that is experiencing difficulty, not just the one in question, the Revenue Commissioners have a 24-7 helpline in operation. They have staff at both Dublin and Rosslare ports 24-7. There is assistance available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at both ports. Enterprise Ireland has a number of supports that are still available to ensure businesses get every support they possibly can to overcome the challenges that have arisen owing to Brexit, which challenges were not of our doing but which we are left to deal with.</p>

            <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_751">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue. Drogheda Educate Together Secondary School, Drogheda ETSS, is on Mill Road outside Drogheda. It currently has 110 students enrolled, an admissions cap of 72 for next year and 55 students on the waiting list. There is huge growth in the population in the area. Hundreds of houses are being built and there is major demand for education right where the school sits. The school has a three-year lease at present so there is no reason the Department of Education should not continue to sustain and support it in its present location, beside where all the families come from.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> The key point is that the parents will not stand for the school being moved from this location. The school was on grounds adjacent to Coláiste na hInse at one stage and now it is on Mill Road. The Department, in its wisdom, proposes to relocate it a few miles away, on the grounds of yet another school, St. Oliver's, where I taught and which has more than 1,200 students. The Department proposes to take from St. Oliver's the recreation and amenity space its pupils and community enjoy and to put another school, a fabulous school, Drogheda ETSS, on the site. It will not wash or hold and the people will not accept it. Therefore, I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to enter negotiations with Educate Together, buy the site beside the school and do the business. That is what those affected want. It is our job as Deputies. Deputy Nash and I will work together to ensure we can deliver the school. What is happening is unacceptable and the parents will not accept it. I ask the Minister of State, whom I acknowledge is not ultimately responsible, to bring to the Minister the loud, clear and irrevocable message of the parents. They will not have the school moved for the third time. It is unacceptable that a school should be moved to four different locations before getting the site it so much wants. Houses have been built in the area and ten acres have been zoned for schools there so let us do the business.</p>

            <p eId="para_753">I will put it simply to the Minister of State: this ridiculous, wrong-headed decision needs to be overturned, and it needs to be overturned now. To say that students, local families and the staff of the school were shocked at the decision and how it was imposed, without any consultation with the school community, is an absolute understatement. I have had a very close relationship with the fine school since the concept of an Educate Together school first emerged to serve the south Drogheda and east Meath areas and it was always understood that the school, in its temporary manifestation and as a permanent facility, would be situated in east Meath. This is where it is and where it ought to stay. Families chose the school for that very reason. The Department has, by its actions, broken the covenant of trust with the local community. Many families face a journey of over 40 minutes each morning to take their children to school. It is unacceptable to me and to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_754"> The messages I received from distressed young people over the past few days about the diktat coming from on high are absolutely heartbreaking. Since last March, we have known that the world has become much smaller for younger people. We are aware of how distressed and anxious they are, and this matter is only adding to the distress in my community. We have a duty to mind the young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_755"> Nobody from the Department has told me why the school cannot expand on the Mill Road site. I wish to be shown the appraisal and technical assessment that were done. I do not believe they exist. Why was St. Oliver's, Drogheda, chosen and not a site in the control of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board in Laytown? How much has the Department spent on the Mill Road facility to date? It seems the Department is content to allow hundreds of thousands of euro of taxpayers' money to go to waste as a site that has already been developed is allowed to go to waste. The Minister of State needs to front up and explain how this wrong-headed decision was hatched, and why. We need full disclosure and transparency now because the decision stinks. It is not a solution for Drogheda ETSS or the community. It might be a solution for the Department of Education but it will not wash with the people I represent.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">Yes, I have heard both Deputies loud and clear, and I have noted their frustration and passion. I thank them for raising this matter on behalf of their constituents. It provides the Department with an opportunity to clarify the position on the proposed interim move of Drogheda ETSS from its existing location on Mill Street to the State-owned Louth and Meath Education and Training Board site, which I know is at Rathmullan Road, Drogheda.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> Drogheda ETSS is a co-educational post-primary school that opened in September 2019 as a regional solution to meet the demand for additional post-primary school places in the Drogheda and Laytown school planning areas. Regional solutions are generally put in place where projected growth in a single school planning area may not, of itself, warrant the provision of a new school. Where the combined demographic increase across a number of adjacent school planning areas indicates insufficient demand for a viable school, then a regional solution may be put in place to serve the areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> As Deputy O'Dowd pointed out, Drogheda ETSS currently has an enrolment of 110 pupils, based on figures from 2020, and a staffing allocation for this year of 12.5 whole-time equivalent teachers. As we know, it is on a temporary site at Mill Road. The school was originally located on a temporary site in Laytown when it first opened, in September 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_760"> As the Deputies are aware, a building project for Drogheda ETSS is included on my Department's school building programme to be delivered under the national development plan as soon as a new site is identified. In this regard, my Department continues to undertake a site-identification process in respect of suitable sites for the permanent school. To date, it has proven challenging to identify suitable available sites in the area in question. Currently, the Department is undertaking an assessment of two potential sites. Obtaining a site for the permanent location of Drogheda ETSS is a priority for my Department. I will be bringing the comments of the Deputies to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Foley.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> In October 2020, the school authority submitted a request through its patron body for additional accommodation to enable it to enrol at least 72 pupils for September 2021 at the Mill Road site. The school authority had outlined its concerns about health and safety, curriculum provision, special education needs, child protection and Covid-19 safety in respect of the school's current location on Mill Road. As the Deputies are aware, there is a demand for additional post-primary school places in Drogheda for September 2021, and my Department wishes to facilitate Drogheda ETSS in ultimately growing to a 1,000-pupil school upon the delivery of its new school building on a permanent site while also addressing the need for additional post-primary school places in Drogheda for September 2021 and subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> Suffice it to say that the demand for accommodation for September 2021 and future years cannot be met at the Mill Road site.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">I reassure the Deputies that the Department is meeting with the patron body tomorrow morning regarding its September 2021 requirements across its network of schools, including Drogheda ETSS.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">The Minister of State does not have the full facts and I appreciate that is not her fault. There is plenty of room on that site. There is a three-year lease, of which this is the first year. I was out there yesterday. There is a large space in front of it and 20 prefabs could be put on it, not just two or three. The people will not move from this site. It would be unacceptable and outrageous that they would be asked to move four times to get the school they need. Some 2,000 parents have signed a petition and the children are angry. They live here and they want to go to school here.</p>
            <p eId="para_765"> Regarding the proposed site, St. Oliver's, more than €300,000 has been spent by the education board and the Department in preparing for a regional headquarters for the education board on that site. There is no way the school can go there. The only place it can go is on the site it is now for three years. There is a 10 acre site in that vicinity for a school zoned by Meath County Council, I have been told. The owner of the land says there is no issue and there is a letter to that effect with the school authorities. They have no problem accommodating any prefabs that may be proposed in the interim. They cannot be moved again. It is unacceptable and I will stand with and for those parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">I agree that the Minister of State, unfortunately, does not seem to have all the facts. Deputy O'Dowd is correct. A letter was forwarded by the owner of the site to the school this afternoon confirming that there are no issues with road access, planning or the scale of the site. Relatively recently, the Department confirmed there were no issues regarding the expansion of the school to meet the needs it has in the short to medium-term.</p>
            <p eId="para_767"> On the St. Oliver's site, one thing we are forgetting is that in 2013 the Department of Education under Ruairi Quinn agreed with me that the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board, ETB, headquarters should be located on the grounds of St. Oliver's Community College. In the meantime, the Department of Education and ETB have been dragging their heels, obfuscating on this issue and, as Deputy O'Dowd said, have spent several hundred thousands of euro in planning fees and so on to try to get this initiative up and running but it has been delayed time and again. That should be the priority for the St. Oliver's site, rather than moving this school to a site where there is no demand, an already constrained site that is under severe pressure. I have a simple message for the Minister of State: get to work developing an imaginative proposal with Educate Together and the owner of the site to ensure the school can stay where it is supposed to be in the east Meath area and identify the permanent site now to fast-track the building of a new permanent facility to serve our area.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">I thank the Deputies for their contribution. My understanding is that there are limitations around the Mill Road site, insofar as it can take a tranche of students for 2021 but not for 2022. It is possible to add two additional classrooms on the site without interfering with the play area. At a push, an additional two classrooms, making four in total, could be added but these would have to be put on the school's play area. An additional four classrooms could be provided, therefore, on the site for 2021 and this would be the maximum. While this could accommodate an enrolment of 72 pupils, the school could not then enrol any further pupils and would have no accommodation left for a September 2022 intake. That is the difficulty when one talks about long-term potential for this school, rather than being able to take a small cohort of pupils in for one year and then having to change again.</p>
            <p eId="para_769"> On site identification for a permanent location, the Department is actively trying to engage with the two sites it is looking at to see if there is a way this school can be provided for. The delivery of the ETB headquarters has been devolved to the ETB and departmental officials are meeting with the ETB tomorrow to review progress with the project and consider the next steps in progressing it, with a view to proceeding to tender and construction as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_770"> The accommodation on the ETB side will have 13 classrooms as opposed to, say, six, two special education needs classrooms, 14 specialist rooms, a library, a staff room and there will be access to playing fields. I have heard what the Deputies have said and their impassioned pleas, which I will pass on to the Minister and the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_771">I thank the Minister of State for taking the opportunity and the time to listen to us. Cobh is an area in east Cork I represent and I have worked with many lobby groups and activists down there over the years. There seems to be a problem. From the emails I have, one specific question resonates most in terms of what people are feeling throughout Cork East, particularly Cobh:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_772">Please ask the Minister and the Government Department if it is the Government's policy to allow private enterprise decide whether families should have or not have superfast broadband based on their commercial criteria rather than on a Government strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">I put this to the Minister of State because of the potential in Cobh for businesses and broadband. In the current climate we are asking people to stay at home and work from home. From the old NET factory in Cobh along the front coast to White Point, which overlooks Roche's Point on the far side of the county, they have, I think, between five and 30 Mbps, which is below the European norm. In the other parts of the town, enterprises are cherry-picking the estates, which seems to be replicated in Cobh, Carrigtwohill, Mitchelstown, Fermoy, the Mallow hinterland and anywhere else in the county. It is frustrating people and pitting neighbours against neighbours because some estates have very good broadband. When one goes in to try to promote businesses, tourism or whatever, people are extremely frustrated because they are not getting their fair share. People have contacted some of these companies and have been told it will be another four to five years before they get broadband and that aggrieves them. I will come back to the Minister of State on the intervention areas or the amber areas because there is a great deal of frustration about those as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_775">We are going to try to make it that. We could talk about every village and community in my constituency but we are in negotiations on digital hubs and we know the way the world has changed over the past year or so. For rural communities, I believe this is for the better but the great enabler is broadband. The difficulty we have in Kiskeam is that Eir broadband is coming almost to the edge of the village on both sides, but not through the village. It is hugely important that it is brought through the village as a matter of urgency. I have been in negotiations with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on an exciting project we hope to bring to fruition within the community. That is why I used the precious time available to me in Dáil Éireann to bring people together to see if there is any hope we could get broadband connectivity in the village.</p>
            <p eId="para_776"> I could talk about every other community as well and I am not forgetting them. It is a great enabler but there is a significant lack of broadband connectivity throughout my constituency. I ask specifically this evening about the village of Kiskeam. We are told that people should live in villages and so forth. Will the Minister of State outline what the Department can do to help to ensure we have connectivity in the village and enable it to prosper and grow through other exciting projects?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2021-02-04T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_777">The national broadband plan contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November 2019 to roll out a high-speed and future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area, which covers 1.1 million people living and working in more than 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms, along with 695 schools. The plan will ensure that citizens throughout the entire country will have access to high-speed broadband services and that nobody is left without this vital service.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> The national broadband plan network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset. The high-speed broadband map, which is available at <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>, shows the areas that will be included in the national broadband plan's State-led intervention, as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. There are 273,548 premises in County Cork, of which 79,424 will be provided with high-speed broadband through the State-led intervention. Government investment in the county under the national broadband plan will amount to €314 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_779"> Despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, NBI has made steady progress on initial works. I am advised by NBI that as of 26 January 2021, more than 166,000 premises in 26 counties had been surveyed, which is ahead of schedule. The next step for NBI is to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre-to-the-home network to these premises and substantial design work is under way. More than 13,000 premises have been surveyed to date in Carrigaline and Midleton and network designs completed. NBI crews have started initial works for the build in the more than 4,500 premises in the Carrigaline area, including Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick, while surveys have started in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Cobh is in the Midleton deployment area and NBI has confirmed that surveys have been completed there. Kiskeam is in the Rathmore area and NBI has confirmed that surveys in this area too are complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_780"> The first fibre-to-the-home connections have been made and, in a test-and-trial phase, in Carrigaline, County Cork and Cavan. Network build works continue and these areas will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release. Since 26 January, retailers have been able to resell the service, and householders in these areas will be able to order high-speed broadband provided via the NBI network. Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website, which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register its interest in being provided with deployment updates.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP, providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network. As of 30 January 2021, 260 BCP sites had been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through similar service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education for schools. The following BCPs in County Cork are now connected and the public can avail of public Wi-Fi at them: Ballindangan, Lissvard community centre, Aghabullogue community centre, Castletownkenneigh community centre, Whitechurch community centre and T.O Park Labbamollaga.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. She was spot on with her figures, and while many of the names of those little towns and villages are a challenge, she was spot on with them as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_783"> On a serious note, I welcome the news of the Cobh-Midleton deployment area and the service being completed. I reiterate that Cobh is an island. It has only the one little bridge to enter it, in Belvelly. The residents always feel they are cut off in many ways. The Naval Service is based there and high-speed broadband is essential, especially given that Cobh has potentially the second deepest natural harbour in the world and it has a thriving tourist industry which we need to preserve. The businesses and the community that are along the waterfront, in particular, need high-speed broadband so they can grow their enterprise, grow Cobh, as part of Cork and part of the country, and put it on the map, as they have been doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_784"> I welcome the Minister of State's comments and, as I said, I will probably contact her about the amber intervention areas because there is much frustration about that. I do not have time to speak further but I appreciate her reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">The frustration in the community of Kiskeam is that broadband was initially supposed to be provided by Eir but, for some unknown reason, the village was taken out of the plan. We were told at the time that villages would be on the Eir priority scheme. The Minister of State mentioned that the surveys had started in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Have those surveys been completed and, if not, when will they be? What is the envisaged timeframe after the completion of the initial surveys by which high-speed broadband will be connected, up and running and available to be offered to the communities? That is the question we want answered. When will it happen and what is the timescale from the completion of the survey to fibre reaching the homes, businesses and communities I represent?</p>

            <p eId="para_786">I understand the frustration over the roll-out of the broadband connection points throughout the country, not least now with many people working from home. My understanding is those initial works have started and I can ask the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to follow up with the Deputy with completion dates on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_787"> In general, the Government is very much committed to the roll-out of the broadband plan. Within the Department, we continue to engage with National Broadband Ireland to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the roll-out of broadband and to establish the possibility of bringing forward to an earlier date premises that are currently scheduled for years six and seven. Furthermore, National Broadband Ireland has established a dedicated team to investigate an acceleration of the roll-out from its current contracted schedule of seven years. All possible alternative network providers are being considered and substantial work has been completed by the team to date, with further actions scheduled over the coming months to explore the potential to accelerate the network roll-out and ensure we can mitigate any delays arising, in particular as a result of Covid-19.</p>
            <p eId="para_788"> On the specific points that both Deputies raised, I will follow up with the Minister to provide a timeline.</p>
