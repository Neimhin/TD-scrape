          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I welcome Deputy O'Dea to his first questions session in his new role as the Fianna Fáil Party's spokesperson on social protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The Revised Estimates for the Department of Social Protection provide for expenditure of just over €20.5 billion in 2012 on the wide range of schemes and services the Department provides. This expenditure represents 39% of gross current Government expenditure and impacts in some way on almost every single person and business in the State, either directly or indirectly. The comprehensive expenditure report published by Government last December provides for additional new expenditure reduction measures of €1,033 billion over the next two years in the Department of Social Protection budget. This includes €540 million of new savings to be achieved in budget 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Reducing overall expenditure in 2013 and beyond in line with these targets will be challenging. As part of my preparations for dealing with these matters, last Friday I held a pre-budget forum in St. Andrew's resource centre on Pearse Street in Dublin. I invited 35 community and voluntary groups to the forum and listened carefully to their views and proposals in relation to the forthcoming budget. These organisations play a key advocacy role in our society and the payments made by my Department play a vital role in providing income support to the individuals they represent. No decisions have been made at this stage as to how these budget targets will be met. As I indicated on Friday last, the Government is committed, in the programme for Government, to maintain social welfare rates. The Government will finalise its consideration of the budget over the coming weeks having regard to all of its commitments. The outcome of this process will be announced on budget day. The House can be assured that my colleagues and I will do our best to ensure the burden of resolving the crisis does not fall disproportionately on those who depend on income supports from my Department.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">I thank the Minister for her good wishes. As I listened to the reply, and as I read the statement on Friday, I was reminded of a literary analogy. The Minister is familiar with George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> and remembers the scene where the basic precepts by which the farm was to be ruled were written on a wall. Whenever it suited the ruling clique to breach one of the precepts, the animals noted that one or two words had been added or removed. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste stated unequivocally that social welfare rates would be maintained. The programme for Government states: "We will maintain social welfare rates." The Minister referred to attending a meeting on Friday, in the presence of the media, at which she committed herself to maintaining core rates of social welfare. The word "core" had been added. Can the Minister enlighten us on what she means by core social welfare rates? The commitment gave a great number of people a great deal of comfort. I assume core social welfare rates includes jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit and old age pensions. Does it include carer's allowance, disability allowance, family income supplement and child benefit? Can the Minister give an assurance about the household benefits package? I am trying to ascertain precisely what the Minister meant by core and what it covers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">The Department of Social Protection is the country's largest spending Department and many people look to the Department for income support. It is important to ensure the maximum protection for those people in the forthcoming budget while reforming social welfare to help people get back to work and become active and engaged. For that reason, I launched the first of the new, integrated social welfare offices yesterday in Sligo. When I spoke on Friday, I referred to core social welfare rates, which are weekly social welfare rates families and individuals receive, as outlined by Deputy O'Dea. They depend on them for their income or for the bulk of their income. In the case of many of our pensioners, weekly pension income may be the only income they receive. Last year, although it was extremely challenging, the Department was able to protect the core weekly social welfare rates of social welfare recipients. We have made no decisions yet on budget 2013, a fact emphasised at the meeting on Friday.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Many kites have been flown by various people about what might or might not happen in the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_10">They have not come from my Department and they have not come from me. Deputy O'Dea referred to <i>Animal Farm</i>. He knows, because he quotes so liberally from it, that in <i>Animal Farm</i> some creatures consider themselves more important than others. I consider the people who are most important are people like our pensioners who require and, I hope, will receive protection in the forthcoming budget. We were able to do that last year and I hope we will be able to do it this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">I am glad the Minister has confirmed that she regards pensioners as more important than others. That is some progress. Do I take the Minister's reply to mean that jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, carer's allowance, family income supplement and disability allowance come within the ambit of core rates? The Minister was widely quoted in the media at the weekend as giving an unequivocal commitment that core rates would be maintained. I did not see a denial of that from the Minister. That is the story that was published. The Minister gave a commitment to a group, in the presence of the media, that core social welfare rates would be maintained. Why does the Minister say no decisions have been taken? Last Friday, she gave the people the impression that decisions had been taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I am happy to reassure Deputy O'Dea that this long-standing practice has not changed simply because Fianna Fáil left Government at the request of the people.

            <p eId="para_18">That commitment is important, but no decision is made until the budget is finalised. I told the Deputy's predecessor, Deputy Barry Cowen, this last year and I am happy to say that when the budget emerged from the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, we were, in the very difficult circumstances bequeathed to us by the Deputy and his colleagues, in a position to protect those rates. I hope we will be in a position to do so this year also. No decisions are made until they are all finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 55 and 56<b>
							</b>together. </p>
            <p eId="para_23"> Creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that Ireland faces and it is essential our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues. To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the programme for Government, I established last year the advisory group on tax and social welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues and make cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. Total social welfare expenditure on children is some €3 billion this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The group’s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. The group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports. I am currently considering the findings of the group’s report on this issue and I intend to publish this report in due course. The report is therefore not yet in the public domain and I do not propose to comment on it at this time. With regard to the budgetary proposals relating to disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance, I understand the group’s report on this issue is being finalised and therefore has not yet been submitted to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I am conscious that the budget 2012 measures concerning disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance gave rise to concerns about the impact on families of people with disabilities, most notably in the case of families of children and young adults with profound disabilities. When the group reverts to me, I and my Government colleagues will reflect carefully on its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Finally, it should be noted that the previous Government, in its budget for 2009, announced that the qualifying age for receipt of the disability allowance should be raised to 18 years of age and that domiciliary care allowance would continue to be paid from the age of 16 to 18 years in its place. While this decision was deferred, the Department of Social Protection value for money review of the disability allowance scheme, published in 2010, found that the case for increasing the minimum age for disability allowance from 16 to 18 years was compelling. In this regard, it was determined that the payment of disability allowance to 16 year olds may also give rise to issues within families as to the control and use of the payment. The view expressed in much commentary and numerous reports on this is that when a child is 16 years old it would be better if the payment went to the child's parent. The view is that it is appropriate and proper that income in respect of a child goes to the parent rather than the child getting a social welfare payment at 16 years old.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I will deal first with my question about child benefit. I realise the Minister cannot say specifically what will happen in the budget but there have been a number of proposals, one of which is that child benefit be cut by €40 and that a separate top-up system be put in place. Is the Minister seriously considering a two rate child benefit system, to include a top-up system? Does she agree that a family with two children would lose almost €1,000 per year - the exact figure is €960 - if the proposed cut of €40 is implemented? This would be a substantial amount for any family but for many families the removal of that amount could be a tipping point. Is the Minister aware that her Department's value for money review of child benefit, published in 2010, demonstrated the dependence of middle income families on child benefit? Its analysis found that households in the fourth and fifth of the ten income brackets fell below or on the poverty line after paying their taxes and that in many cases child benefit lifted them above that line. Many of those households would be affected by any change in child benefit if the Minister opted to move away from universality.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> The Minister said she will publish the reports after considering them. Will that be before the budget changes or afterwards? That is a key question for Members on all sides of the House, so that when decisions are made in the budget they will have some idea where they originated and whether the reports are based on the facts of day-to-day living. I refer to the report of the advisory group on tax and social welfare and the report relating to the changes the Minister had intended to introduce to the disability allowance in last year's budget and on which she rowed back after the outcry from the people affected, particularly the parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">The total spend on child benefit in 2012 is estimated at €2.078 billion. It is €199 million on family income supplement. The payment of qualified child increases of nearly €30 per week, which go to families on social welfare, account for a further €698 million, and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance accounts for another €64 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">That brings the total spend on child-related benefits to just over €3.04 billion. In the context of a social welfare budget of €20.5 billion, it is a significant amount and that is appreciated by families in Ireland, particularly mothers. I am on the record many times saying that I value the universal payment because it is paid to the caring parent and directly in cash rather than, as happens in other countries, through the tax system or through tax credits. Given the amount we spend on this and other social welfare payments, the question arises of finding a way to target some of this money in a better way for families who are poor, in work or out of work and on social welfare benefits. Is it possible in the context of that €3 billion expenditure to produce better child poverty outcomes?</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The Deputy asked about the advisory group. I have received its report and it is being examined in detail, particularly the issues the Deputy raised such as middle income families because our tax system does not have a direct tax allowance for dependent children. Child benefit is the direct support the State pays to the family. I must bring the report to Cabinet and I have taken the opportunity in the context of other issues related to children, particularly those experiencing poverty, to discuss it with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The report has not been brought to Government yet but once it goes to Government, we will be in a position to publish it. We want to have a close look at how children who are in families who are out of work or in work on low incomes, are impacted by the suggestions in the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">The Minister has made a couple of extraordinary statements since the start of Question Time. I am overwhelmed by her boasting about last year's budget when, according to Social Justice Ireland, an organisation with no axe to grind, it was the most socially regressive budget in the last ten years. The Minister said her Department had not been flying kites but there are so many kites coming out of the Department of Social Protection it will need an air traffic control system.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Wherever this proposal came from, or whatever Government supported it, it was proposed last year by the Minister for Finance in the budget. There were two parts to it. First, the domiciliary care allowance for 16 to 18 year olds was to go to the parents instead and, second, the amount was to be cut. I had no problem with the first measure, I could see the reasoning behind the argument that the money should go to the parents, particularly in cases like this.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The second measure, the proposal to cut the amount, however, generated the controversy. The Government withdrew that proposal in the teeth of public opinion.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">In withdrawing the proposal the Taoiseach said, this is a case in which the Government has listened. He also said that the Government did not get it right. Now the kite is being flown again, even though the Taoiseach said last year that it was wrong. If it was wrong last year, how is it right this year? Will the Minister give an assurance that she will not proceed with the proposal in her budgetary provisions? </p>

            <p eId="para_38">I should tell the House what Social Justice Ireland and other commentators have found in respect of poverty and the social and negative impact of budgets for families on the lower levels of income, whether in work or on social welfare. The biggest reductions with which the Deputy will be familiar, having sat at the Cabinet table when many of these reductions were decided, was the cut of around €16.30 per week in basic core social welfare payments, except for pensioners-----</p>

            <p eId="para_40">-----and the significant cuts over which the Government of which he was a member presided in respect of child benefit. When his Government proposed that the early childhood allowance would be converted to a preschool payment I supported that proposal at the time because I considered that we need to concentrate on the delivery of services, and the development of preschool education is important. The Deputy should concentrate less on the flights of rhetoric and a trawl around books we have all studied at school and more on the reality. The fact is that the Government of which the Deputy was a member crashed the country's economy. Nobody wants to cut or reduce a single social welfare payment for anybody because we all recognise how important such payments are to individuals; we know that from our personal lives and from our political work. We have to sort out what was left to us to sort out and we have to make the country capable of being self-sustaining on a financial basis. I welcome the Deputy saying publicly on behalf of Fianna Fáil that he agrees that children of 16 years of age should have payments paid to their parents who care for them. I welcome it because the previous Government recommended exactly that and also that the domiciliary care allowance would continue to be paid up to the age of 18 years. That is what the previous Government and various reports recommended. The Deputy is entitled to forget history entirely.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I wish to return to the issue of child benefit. Is the Minister aware of the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions which also demonstrates that the income of families fell five times more than the incomes of childless households between 2009 and 2010? It is not always the Minister's fault and we accept that. She inherited chaos but she has added to it. We also accept there is significant spend on child benefit and the other projects she mentioned - family income supplement, qualified child allowance and back to education allowance. Over the years they have prevented greater levels of food poverty and child poverty. It has been reported today that families on low incomes with three or more children are facing food poverty before any changes are made to child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The other issue grouped in these questions is the issue of access to disability allowance for 16 and 17 year olds. Does the Minister accept that if the proposal made last year to raise the age of disability allowance from 16 to 18 proceeded, the households of young people with disabilities would in fact be cut down as much as €6,000 a year because the domiciliary care allowance is substantially lower than the disability allowance? If the Minister were to follow through on her logic and consider taking disability allowance from those who are 16 and 17, we would introduce a different rate of domiciliary care allowance for those and that would be granted. Is that under serious consideration? Is domiciliary care allowance equal to that of the disability allowance for 16 and 17 year olds? If not then it is a cost-saving measure rather than a concern for children with disabilities having too much money to spend. It is not true that the disability allowance received by 16 and 17 year olds was all spent on enjoyment or misspent. In the majority of cases it is spent on their education and helping their parents ensure they stay in education rather than spent on social life as has been portrayed.</p>

The suggestion is that the income received in respect of 16 or 17 year old children should be paid to their parents because they are living in a family context and that would be better in terms of the family and the child.

            <p eId="para_75">I thank Deputy Halligan for his question. To set the issue of statutory sick pay in context, total expenditure on the key illness and disability payments administered by the Department, namely, illness benefit, invalidity pension and disability allowance, amounted to some €10.6 billion in the period from 2008 to 2011. Of that amount, some €3.6 billion relates to illness benefit. The estimated cost of the illness benefit scheme in 2012 is €847 million. This, again, is another big ticket item in the Department, as are the cumulative amounts which are over €3 billion per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> Against this background, there are a number of compelling reasons the Government is at this time considering the introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay to cover public and private sector employers. First, it is necessary to take steps to address the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund from which illness benefit, among other insurance-based benefits and pensions, is paid. In 2011, the deficit in the fund was approximately €1.5 billion. Second, such a scheme would help to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability, except obviously in the case of people who have a serious disability. Third, it would serve to bring Ireland into line with practice in other countries in this area. Fourth, it would contribute towards enhancing the health of the workforce and achieve active management of absenteeism. This is the way in which the Scandinavian countries, which have good social protection systems, work. They have good outcomes and good social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">
              <i>Additional Information not give on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_78"> In considering the matter, I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and, in particular, the pressures facing smaller and medium-sized enterprises. I am equally conscious of the need to maintain competitiveness, facilitate business opportunities and generate sustainable employment. I would not accept that introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay would necessarily lead to greater job insecurity in the private sector and experience from other countries supports my view. In this regard, I wish to make it clear that the three day waiting period which currently applies in respect of illness benefit would also apply in any scheme of statutory sick pay introduced. </p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The question of providing for possible compensatory mechanisms for particularly vulnerable employers is just one of a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme. Other issues include the extent of coverage, the rate of payment and how a scheme would be enforced. The Department has engaged in wide ranging consultation to date and all of these issues will again be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of budget 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> The Deputy will be aware that questions associated with absenteeism generally in the public sector are being addressed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and proposals for change in this area are being advanced at present. </p>

            <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_81">I thank the Minister for her reply. While her desire to address the level of absenteeism in the public and private sector is commendable - I do not have a problem with it - like many other people I believe these proposals will have a terrible impact on jobs, in particular in the small and medium business sector. There is much made of the crucial role which multinationals play in the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">I am fearful the critical role small and medium-sized enterprises play in villages, small towns and city centres is being gravely overlooked. The influential report, A Blueprint for Ireland's Recovery, drafted by leading business figures, places SMEs at the front line of economic recovery. However, the survey released last week by ISME stated 96% of SMEs expect job losses if the Minister's proposals are introduced. SMEs already contribute significantly to the social welfare fund through the PRSI system and cannot take any more. An average of five small companies a week are going bust or are unable to access capital. If the Minister's proposed measures are introduced, they will undoubtedly result in longer dole queues. Those of us on the left are also concerned it may force employers to revisit any sick pay policies they offer, which would be wholly unfair to the workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">My question is straightforward. I understand there has been little or no dialogue on the proposal with business communities. On many occasions the Chamber of Commerce in Waterford sought a meeting with the Minister. I know she is very busy but at the very least she should have met it. Will the Minister agree to establish an interdepartmental working group with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to conduct a regulatory impact assessment of these proposals? Will she discuss the practicalities of such proposals with small business groups?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_85">I reassure the Deputy I have had many opportunities to meet business groups and employers of various sized businesses throughout the country. I emphasise that any proposal applies as much to the public sector as the private sector. I am very conscious of the need to maintain competitiveness, facilitate business growth and opportunities, generate sustainable employment and maintain the employment we have. I do not accept that introducing a statutory sick pay scheme would necessarily lead to greater job insecurity in the private sector. We are the only OECD country with our particular structure. According to our proposals, the three-day waiting period which applies at present in respect of illness benefit would also apply in any statutory sick pay scheme introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> Another question is whether we need to provide possible compensatory mechanisms for particularly vulnerable employers, including the type of SME referred to by the Deputy. This needs to be addressed and taken into account before any decision can be made by the Government. The difficulty is that illness benefit is paid from a social insurance fund which was in deficit to the tune of €1.5 billion last year and this year it will be €1.82 billion short. The fund from which statutory benefits are paid, and which we all want to keep intact following our earlier discussion, is short of money by a considerable degree. We must address how to restore stability to the social insurance fund over a period of time. It will stabilise enormously as employment returns to the economy but it is the mechanism by which we make payments such as jobseeker's benefit, contributory old age pensions and significant amounts in sickness benefit.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">Everyone agrees that expenditure needs to be reduced, but a statutory sick pay scheme cannot be introduced in isolation and cuts that have the least effect on unemployment need to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">I have an interesting statistic. According to ISME, the typical number of days lost per annum due to absenteeism in small firms is three compared to the massively inefficient figure of over 12 days in the public sector. The point I am making, which the Minister may have taken on board, is that it is the small to medium-sized businesses which are on the edge. I spoke here a few months ago about a family business whose owners worked 70 hours per week and took home €390 after they paid all their costs and VAT. They are barely surviving, so a small amount of extra costs on their business could turn it over. The same is applicable to businesses across the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T14:45:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_89">The Deputy makes the point very well. Based on what we know from various surveys, absenteeism levels are significantly higher in the public sector than in the private sector. I reiterate that the current system, which there are no proposals to change, stipulates that the first three days are not paid for by the employer or the State but are covered by the individual. It is not proposed to change that. The proposal involves having a look at reducing the overall levels of illness, particularly in the public sector, with which my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is dealing. I do not want to mention the Croke Park agreement but there are certain reforms under discussion and there are positive outcomes. The critical thing internationally is that if issues like illness are dealt with at the firm, group, operations or departmental level, there are much better outcomes for the employees. Otherwise, one risks a situation arising where a percentage of people end up taking long-term illness leave. I am not referring here to those who have an accident or very serious illness which may be life-threatening; that is understood by everybody. However, as the Deputy noted, in parts of the public sector, building up a significant number of sick days has become, unfortunately, something that is an Irish experience. It was so in other countries but they have reformed the system to put the emphasis on wellness at work. For example, if somebody's lifestyle resulted in him or her having repeated periods of illness, the firm and management, be they in the public or private sector, would help that individual to address those difficulties to avoid it becoming a chronic condition and possibly leading to that person leaving the workforce.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 69, 73, 78 and 81 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_96"> There have been no cuts whatsoever to disability allowance or to any of the Department's other disability schemes. This is borne out by the increasing numbers of claimants and payments. It should be noted that all the Department's schemes are demand-led and are not budget capped. A total of €820 million has been spent on disability allowances to the end of September 2012 and there were just over 103,000 recipients as at the end of August 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">Expenditure on the disability allowance in 2011 was over €1.09 billion in respect of 102,866 recipients. There are more people receiving disability allowance this year and we are spending more money on it this year. There have been no cuts whatsoever.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> Following budget 2012, I requested the advisory group on tax and social welfare to examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the budgetary proposals relating to the disability allowance and domiciliary care allowance. The group was established last year. Its report is being finalised and it has not yet been submitted to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_99"> I am conscious that the budget 2012 measures concerning disability allowance and the domiciliary care allowance gave rise to concerns about the impact on families of people with disabilities, most notably in the case of families of children and young adults with profound disabilities. These very real concerns are being taken into account by the advisory group. When the group reverts to me with its report on these proposals, I, together with my Government colleagues, will reflect carefully on the findings. However, it should be noted that the payment of disability allowance at such a young age may give rise to issues within families as to the control and use of the payment. The Deputy will agree on this point. The view has been expressed over a long period that it is appropriate and proper that income in respect of a child go to the parent rather than having the child receive a social welfare payment at 16.</p>
            <p eId="para_100"> The number of claims decided on the disability allowance scheme in the first nine months of 2012 was 19,702. Of these, 7,513 allowances, or 38%, were awarded, and 11,170, or 57%, were refused. The balance of claims was withdrawn by the applicants. The refusal rate has been broadly consistent over the past three years, with comparable rates of 58% in 2011 and 54% in 2010. The refusal rate in any year reflects the extent to which the applications made meet the qualifying conditions for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> In all cases, the applicant has the right to have his decision reviewed by a deciding officer, or he can appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. The overall trend of disability allowance appeals being allowed or partly allowed by that office has been reducing over the past six years, having peaked at 49% in 2009. I am satisfied that each case is fully considered and adjudicated on its individual merits at all stages of the decision-making and appeals process.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">Will the Minister undertake to publish the advisory group's report on the disability and domiciliary care allowances when she receives it?</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> In a reply to me, dated 23 August 2012, the Minister gave me statistics on the disability allowance. In 2009, there were 20,794 applications received and the number disallowed was 9,677, indicating a success rate of 55% or refusal rate of 45%. In 2010, there were 21,409 applications received and 10,316 were disallowed, again suggesting a rejection rate of 45% and an acceptance rate of 55%. However, in 2011, the number of applications received was 24,264 while the number of applications refused was 14,116, representing a success rate of 38%. Therefore, the success rate decreased from 55% over the preceding two years to 38% in 2011. The figures for the year to date up to September, which the Minister has just given, indicate a 37% success rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Does the Minister agree that it appears a different approach is being taken to applications for disability allowance, in that the success rates have suddenly dropped from 55% in 2009 and 2010 to 38% and 27% in 2011 and 2012, respectively?</p>

People with disabilities will not be able to suffer further cuts, although I am not saying that the Minister plans any. She does not need me to tell her the statistics. People with disabilities are much more likely to experience poverty. Many of them also live in households experiencing difficulties amplified by austerity. These people are not isolated from austerity. I am sure that the Minister is aware that they also have poor educational outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">The number of people in need of help is increasing. A government's <i>raison d'être</i> should be to take care of those most in need. In this light, will the Minister protect people with disabilities in the budget?</p>

            <p eId="para_121">Approaching last year's budget, I gave an undertaking to do my best to ensure that core social welfare rates would be protected. I am happy to say that this occurred, particularly in terms of disability. Our society has a problem as a consequence of the collapse of the banks, the building industry and the tax revenues related to the latter.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">Even within these constraints, it is a tribute to everyone in the Dáil that Deputies from the Government and the Opposition have strongly supported me in helping people on disability payments. I am not able to tell the Deputy now what will be the outcome of the budget deliberations, but I will make the case very strongly to my colleagues around the Cabinet table. I hope, like last year, there will be a positive response.</p>
            <p eId="para_123"> Since becoming Minister, I have introduced a series of initiatives which we do not have time to debate now but which assist people with a disability by having the employability services help employers who take on people with a disability. One of the problems for many people with a disability is that if it is difficult for an able-bodied person to get a job now, it is even more difficult for people with a disability. I have done much for employers, including giving grants and wage subsidies, to encourage them to give people with a disability an opportunity to participate in the labour force.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">Does the Minister agree that the significant rise in the number of people applying for disability allowance is a consequence not only of the downturn but especially the added difficulty that people with a disability have in accessing employment at this stage? It is very disappointing to have the refusal rate as high as it is, at 62%. Is the Minister concerned that in 2011, one in three of the disability allowance refusals appealed to the Department was successful? It is a significant number, meaning that with a third of cases, the work in the initial phase was done incorrectly. The Ombudsman has raised the concern that a cost-cutting agenda was pursued, leading to people who would have been entitled to payments on a medical basis before the recession being refused now. Will the Minister assure the House that there is no internal directive or unwritten rule to refuse disability allowance applications and hope they will go away or only be granted on appeal, with a delay in between?</p>

            <p eId="para_125">I can give the Deputy that assurance. In 2001, the disability payments bill was €1.1 billion, and that increased in 2011 to €2.7 billion. The number of people claiming in 2001 was 173,000 and that has grown to 242,000, or just shy of 250,000. The scheme is demand-led and is not capped. I spoke to the Deputy about this. We are seeking to improve the structure of the scheme to give a better service. As the Deputy and I have discussed on a number of occasions, there has been a big surge in applications. I can send the Deputy a summary of why people are unsuccessful in appeals. Very often, at the initial application stage, people's applications may be seriously incomplete. There may not be the quality medical evidence that is required to allow the medical assessor to stipulate that a person qualifies for a disability payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">As the Deputy is aware, what happens then is that people submit a further application or an appeal - very often in multiples. Some people simply do not produce the paper work. We are working on projects to ensure that is improved over a period of time. As I said, we are computerising and scanning the applications so that if an application is incomplete, we can hold it. We do not have to recreate the entire application.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T15:05:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_127">I find it extraordinary. This system has been in place for many years and people are suddenly starting to produce inadequate applications. When did this start? The Minister stated that in the last year of the previous Government - 2010 - there was a jump in refusals. Her letter dated 23 August states that in 2010 some 21,409 applications were received. The number of applications disallowed in that year was 10,316. We do not have to get out our calculators to know that is less than half, or 45%. Some 55% were successful. In 2011, however, the number of applications received was 24,264. The number of applications disallowed was 14,116, which is a 62% refusal rate and a 38% success rate. That is the difference between 2010 and 2011. I put that to the Minister again to correct her previous statement. As I said, according to the Minister's letter dated 23 August and signed by herself, there was a 45% refusal rate in 2010 and a 62% refusal rate in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> Is it not untrue to say there is no change in the eligibility criteria? Do I not recall something in the social welfare part of last year's budget whereby instead of being substantially restricted, there must be a 15% measurable disability? Has that change not occurred? Perhaps that explains the increase in the refusal rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">Going back to Deputy O'Dea's last comment, I think he is referring to the scheme I brought in after I became Minister of a partial disability payment which was long requested by disability organisations to allow people to go back to work. For instance, somebody might have a long-term condition from which he or she suffers periodically but he or she may wish to continue to work. I brought that in because I was very anxious to ensure that people who have a disability are facilitated in going back to work to the maximum extent. The figures the Deputy read out in regard to cases decided - I have the same figures here - indicated that the high point in regard to allowance rates was 49% in 2009. In 2010, it went down to 39% and it has stayed in and around that since then. I am reading out the statistics that have been given to me by the Department. All I can say is that the statistics are published by the Department. If the Deputy refuses to believe them-----</p>

            <p eId="para_137">With regard to Deputy Wallace's question about carers, in last year's budget I prioritised that carers would not receive a reduction in the payments made to them. I am happy that my colleagues in Government supported that approach. I am aware that people who have a disability are dependent on the quality of services they receive. When I met the 35 groups last Friday for four hours of discussion about the forthcoming budget and how the current economic crisis affected them, four or five of the groups were present to specifically represent people with disabilities, including, for the first time, centres for independent living. They made a compelling case about their members, many of whom are wheelchair users but who are active in the workforce and in education. They are anxious that the Government makes more of an effort to encourage employers to give people with a disability a chance.</p>

We are working on this in the Department. Many Members assist individual constituents and it would be hugely helpful to the Department if the applications were as complete as possible and had as much supporting medical evidence as possible from the applicants' medical advisers.

          <p eId="para_152">The Taoiseach promised in page 6 of the programme for Government:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_153"> Investment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority for this Government. Additional funding will be provided each year for the care of older people. The funding will go to more residential places, more home care packages and the delivery of more home help and other professional community care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The reality on the ground is very different from the promises and commitments he made. A cut of 600,000 home help hours was announced earlier this year and that has been followed by a cut of €8 million in the budget for the service, which will take out another 450,000 hours. This amounts to approximately 1 million hours in what is clearly a cold and callous cut by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The Older and Bolder organisation, a respectable and reputable body engaged in supporting people in terms of their care needs, has a significant campaign under way to identify the views of people on the ground regarding the impact of these cuts. I will quote one or two of them who wrote to the Taoiseach. One states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_156">Dear Taoiseach,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_157">I note from my inquiries on behalf of a relative that there appears to be no home help currently available to elderly in the community no matter how vulnerable. This needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Another says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_159">As a carer for my 81 year old mother, I can see the difference that being at home has done her even though she is in total heart failure. I believe she would be gone a long time if she was in a home or a hospital ... I hope that your Government will keep all their promises and home helps in place so that my mother can enjoy the quality of life that she now has.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">By any yardstick or objective, it is accepted that home help and care in the community is essential in dealing with and helping older people to have a decent quality of life. Can the Taoiseach indicate why there is such a gulf between the language contained in the programme for Government and the decisions his Government has taken regarding home help? Does he intend to review the programme for Government in light of the yawning gap between the two?</p>

          <p eId="para_161">The Deputy should deal with the reality. The target in the 2012 HSE service plan was to deliver 10.7 million home help hours to 50,000 people with a budget of €200 million. The reduction will see 10.3 million hours delivered to them. There will be a reduction of €8 million in the budget for the service between now and the end of the year because the money is not there. I have made it clear that decisions on the home help service and on home help hours will continue to be based on a review of each individual's needs and they are all different. No current recipient of the service who has an assessed medical need will be left without a service. The overall provision of home help services is reviewed regularly at national and local level in the context of the needs of each client and of the resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> As I said in answer to questions last week, two reviews have happened this year. The focus now will be on those who are most dependent and require personal care and hygiene services such as washing, incontinence management and so on, which are sensitive and personal.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">We will maintain those by, if necessary, reducing lesser dependency duties like shopping or cleaning. The money is not there and we must adjust accordingly. The overall position is that anyone with an assessed need for a home help service will not be left without one. The HSE is under instruction from the Department and the Minister to implement this in as sensitive and caring a fashion as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">The funding was there previously but it was not raised subsequently. People who depend on home help hours are suffering because of the inability to raise €220 million between health insurers and drug pricing. As a result, there will be savage cuts at the 11th hour for those depending on home help. These people are fragile, ill and living in difficult circumstances. We do not want them to go into institutions or long-term care settings if we can avoid it. Does the Taoiseach accept the commitment made in plain language is false or, at the very least, should be withdrawn because it cannot be fulfilled?</p>

          <p eId="para_174">The work of restructuring, in terms of the Croke Park agreement, its review and its implementation, and squeezing the maximum out of the programme, in order to lessen the impact on front line services, is under way. The decision on the agreement reached in respect of the cost of drugs will yield substantial savings of €400 million over the coming three years. The decisions and agreements on consultants rostering, some of which may go to the Labour Court, will bring about savings in the future. I would like to have seen these things happen by now but, for a variety of difficulties, they could not be finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> For the foreseeable future, between now and the end of the year, the Minister for Health must make adjustments to his budget. In each case, the review will be carried out sensitively and with a degree of understanding. I would much prefer to be saying here that we are in a position to continue the level of hours for home help services and to expand the service between now and the end of the year. However, that is not the reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">The review also takes into account where hours are allocated to individuals who are not as needy as those who require medical services on a regular basis. They speak for themselves. The Minister must make adjustments within reality and the changes made to structure of the health service will deliver savings that will lessen the impact on front line services. That is why the ongoing work in discussions and negotiations on the Croke Park agreement can evolve to a point where substantial savings can be squeezed out as a consequence of the implementation of the agreement in full in the shortest possible time.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">I welcome the remarks of the Taoiseach in Cleveland about a united Ireland. Nothing in life or politics is inevitable. Uniting the people of this island and ending partition is one of the major challenges facing us at the beginning of the 21st century. Aontaímid, sin é mo bharúil, agus creidim sin go han-láidir. Tá ceart ag muintir an oileáin seo a bheith saor agus a bheith le chéile ach ni tharlóidh sin gan obair, gan phleanáil agus gan an Rialtas a bheith ag obair le daoine eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> We need a plan. The Taoiseach's statement in Cleveland was welcome. A united Ireland will only happen when those of us who want it persuade those who want to maintain the union that their future and the future of their children is best served in the new dispensation. Partition is unjust, inefficient, is not working and is costly. We must demonstrate in practical ways why working together as partners and living together as equals is better.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Yesterday, the British Prime Minister and the Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, agreed a date for a referendum on Scottish independence. The union is now a live debating issue and the people of Scotland will have their say in 2014. The Good Friday Agreement provides for a similar poll, a Border poll, and I invite the Taoiseach to begin dialogue, with those who want a united Ireland and those who do not, about the future. I ask the Taoiseach to come back to the Dáil within the next short while with an outline of how he envisages securing the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement on the Border poll.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">The question I was asked in Cleveland was whether I believed there would be a united Ireland by 2016. I said I did not believe there would be a united Ireland by 2016 and gave reasons for that. On 12 October, part of the Good Friday Agreement was being implemented and demonstrated here by virtue of the work of the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, where the North-South Parliamentary Forum met for its first session. I also pointed out that in terms of the development of the economy of the island of Ireland, great co-operation takes place within North-South Ministerial Councils, which I chair, in areas such as health, education, transport, commerce, business and trade. The next meeting is in November. These are important elements and I referred to the effect they have on developing the economies North and South. I referred to the work under way by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the politicians in Northern Ireland in respect of the possibility of reducing the corporate tax rate to the level that applies here, 12.5%. I also referred to the fact that we have made arrangements for personnel from Northern Ireland to participate in the permanent representation in Brussels, so that they are fully informed and up to date on logistics for the Presidency, which will have an impact in respect of the multi-financial framework, possibly to be decided before the end of the year, and Common Agricultural Policy reform, which will fall within the Irish Presidency. From that point of view, it has implications for the agri-sector in Northern Ireland. That is the question I was asked and the answer I gave.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> It is appropriate to continue our dialogue and work to demonstrate to people that the impact of the Good Friday Agreement can have a beneficial effect on the economies, North and South. Therefore, as a consequence, it has an effect on employment levels and job opportunities, which are the most important factor in our consideration. I am well aware of inclusion, in regard to the reference Deputy Adams made to Border polls, but the priority is to rectify our public finances, see that our colleagues in Europe implement the decisions made there, which will have a beneficial impact in this country, and to continue to work towards those so that we can emerge from our bailout programme and decide in a more individual way where our future lies.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle, agus ag an Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I read the Taoiseach's remarks which he has repeated here today. It is obvious why I would welcome them. They were a good outline of what has been achieved and of what is continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I also commend the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly on the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association meeting. This is a good and quiet example of working for mutual benefit. The North-South Ministerial Council and all the sectoral elements are working together to erase at least some of the worst aspects of the negative effects of partition.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I am consciously not asking the Taoiseach simply to give a response here today. I am asking him to consider that we have to go further than this. The issue is topical because of what is happening in Scotland but it is also one of the huge challenges facing us. No Irish Government has brought forward a plan. I spent yesterday at Stormont. The atmosphere in the North is totally different from what it used to be when I was growing up there. There is considerable potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> Would the Taoiseach go away and consider the Government's attitude to a Border poll, a Green Paper or to opening up a dialogue? We have ideas on many of these issues. They are part of an international agreement, the Good Friday Agreement, aspects of which have yet to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I invite the Taoiseach to prepare a strategy in co-operation with the rest of us and to commit the Government to taking the lead on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I thank Deputy Adams for his comments. When I was speaking to the First Minister of Scotland, Mr. Alex Salmond MSP, at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly some time ago, he outlined the opportunity that might exist for people in Scotland to cast their votes on independence. That opportunity is to be given. The agreement to do so was signed yesterday. One question will be asked of the electorate. There are various views as to what the Scottish people wish to do. I do not want to go that far now.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I was struck by the presentation made here some time ago by the survivors of Kingsmill. I want to meet the group Ms Arlene Foster MLA wishes to bring here from Fermanagh, and with the Ballymurphy people Deputy McDonald spoke of last week. Other groups have requested meetings. There is a great well of emotion which needs to be released from ordinary people whose loved ones lost their lives on either side of this conflict. It is not the time to have a poll in a Border situation when such a well of emotion needs to be released so that a new understanding about the future is brought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> This is not the time for a Green Paper. I take the Deputy's point and I am well aware of what the Good Friday Agreement says. There is, however, a time and place for everything. We need to get our economy in order here. We need to see the excitement and encouragement that people will experience when the economy is growing and thriving and jobs are being created with direct beneficial impact on the Border. I hope the same can apply to the Border areas in the Six Counties and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The Constitutional Convention may have an opportunity to reflect on this. I sent invitations to all political parties. One of those parties has declined to send a representative to the convention when it is set up. That forum will have an opportunity to reflect on the issues raised by the Deputy, such as Green Papers, Border polls and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> A priority of the Government is to deal with our economy and the issues that arise from that. With regard to Northern Ireland issues, I would like to provide an opportunity for those who have never had the chance to speak their minds about what happened within their family units on either side of the conflict, with devastating and tragic results. We owe them that, at least. </p>

          <p eId="para_196">The group of home helps, mostly low paid women workers, whom I brought to the Gallery for Leader's Questions two weeks ago will hold a demonstration tomorrow against the Government's moves to cut home help hours and privatise home help services. They decided to hold this protest because they were so furious at the Taoiseach's response to the concerns I raised on their behalf and the way he misrepresented their plight and that of elderly and disabled people for whom they provide services.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The Taoiseach dismissed the idea that home helps are now working on an on-the-clock system, when they are. He also said people who need home help hours are getting them, when huge numbers of home help hours are being cut. A woman contacted my office today to tell me she has been on a waiting list for home help for weeks and now has to pay a private home help company €26 per hour to get the services the Government is not providing for her. That example is at the nub of the issue. Home helps who are working for not-for-profit organisations and earning approximately €12 per hour are being replaced by private companies that are charging €26 per hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> It gets worse. The person advising the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, was until last year working for Sedexo, the parent company of one of the private home help providers that is benefitting from Government cuts in home help hours and the privatisation of the home help service.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Will the Taoiseach reverse these despicable cuts in home help hours which are being directed at the elderly and disabled in our society? Will he halt the agenda of privatising home help services to the benefit of private companies that see the needs of the elderly and disabled as nothing more than an opportunity to make profit? Will he come out of the bubble of the Dáil tomorrow and meet the home helps when they arrive at the gates of Dáil Éireann and assure them that he is not going to sacrifice their jobs and their service in order to pay back the bankers and speculators who wrecked our economy?</p>

          <p eId="para_209">The adviser to the Minister for Health has been an adviser since February of this year. Her job is to give the Minister advice in the best interests of the health service, in which she is an expert. In 2005, this person took on a role as a consultant to Zehnacker, a German company providing a range of services to health services and other areas in a number of European countries. That company provided services such as catering, cleaning, facility management and so on. In June 2010, Zehnacker merged with the multinational company Sedexo. It is Sedexo that is the parent company of Comfort Keepers. The adviser to the Minister was never involved with the new aspect of that business venture.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I am also advised that the HSE has confirmed that the recently concluded tender for certain home care services has been carried out strictly in accordance with all appropriate EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">It should be noted that the outcome of this tender process will not impact on existing service providers and will only apply to any new home care packages to be assigned during the lifetime of the agreement.

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_169">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_273"> I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 26, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_274"> I wish to emphasise again for the House that I am in regular and ongoing contact with my European Council colleagues and I avail of every opportunity to engage bilaterally with them. While in Rome on 21 September, I met with Prime Ministers Mario Monti, Mariano Rajoy and Antonis Samaras. At all of these meetings the primary focus was on developments in the euro area. I updated all three leaders on economic developments here, including our efforts to secure progress on making our banking debt more sustainable. The question of the Union's future budget, the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, also arose.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> In my meeting with Prime Minister Monti we also considered the issues expected to arise at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council, including President Van Rompuy's work on strengthening economic and monetary union. We briefed each other on economic developments and stressed our shared commitment to driving the jobs and growth agenda forward. We also looked forward to Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_276"> In my meeting with Prime Minister Rajoy, the Prime Minister updated me on developments in Spain, especially in its banking sector. As the House will be aware, a report on the recapitalisation needs of Spanish banks has since been published. Likewise, I updated Prime Minister Rajoy on developments here and on our efforts to ensure that the commitments made at the euro summit in June are honoured in full. This is very much a shared agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> Prime Minister Samaras updated me on the efforts his government is making to meet the requirements of its second programme. The situation in Greece remains extremely difficult and I wished him every success in his efforts to reach a positive outcome in ongoing discussions with the troika.</p>
            <p eId="para_278"> Together with our colleagues in the Government, the Tánaiste and I travelled to Brussels on 3 October for pre-Presidency meetings with the College of Commissioners. Discussions covered the full range of policy matters likely to be on the agenda during our term in office. I highlighted that the key issues for us will be jobs and growth, as well as stability of the euro. I had one-on-one meetings with the President of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, and with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy. In both meetings, I took the opportunity to provide an update on economic developments here and to stress the importance of the question of banking-related debt for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_279"> My meeting with President Barroso was very much focussed on plans and priorities for our Presidency. Issues that arose in this regard included jobs and growth, the Single Market, including in the digital area, and trade. We both stressed our commitment to ensuring a constructive and collaborative relationship between the Commission and the Council during our term. We both also expressed hope that an agreement can be found on the Union's future budget, the multi-annual financial framework, at the meeting of the European Council in November, allowing us to focus on implementation of the agreement during our term. We further discussed the wider economic agenda confronting the Union, including the need to make the most of the tools we already have available to us to drive the reform process forward. I said that overseeing the next round of the European semester would be an important issue for us as Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_280"> The semester is part of the Europe 2020 reform process in the European Union. This aims at securing smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The European Council is playing a central role in driving this work forward, and we reinforced our commitment to Europe 2020 in the compact for growth and jobs agreed in June. I also took the opportunity to thank President Barroso for the supportive role the Commission, especially Commissioner Olli Rehn, has played as a member of the troika, including in its support for an agreement on our banking debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_281"> The European Council agenda in the months ahead was the focus of discussions in my meeting with President Van Rompuy. This included his ongoing work on strengthening economic and monetary union; efforts to stabilise the eurozone, including through urgent implementation of the euro summit statement agreed on 29 June; and progress on banking union. We also considered prospects for agreement on the MFF.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> In its meeting later this week, the European Council will review progress in the implementation of the compact for growth and jobs; receive President Van Rompuy's interim report on strengthening economic and monetary union; assess progress made on proposals on a single European banking supervisory mechanism, and examine the wider issue of banking union; have an exchange of views on relations with strategic partners, including China; and address specific foreign policy issues, most likely including the situation in Syria. As I will be making a statement to the House on this week's European Council later today, I will not go into detail on our priorities. However, I intend to engage positively with colleagues on each of the issues on the agenda to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> I met with the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, during his visit to Dublin on 4 October. As in my other meetings, we discussed our plans and priorities for our Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_284">I expressed my support and respect for the enhanced role being played by the Parliament since the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty and we agreed the importance of working closely and co-operatively together. We also considered the wider European agenda, including economic issues and the multi-annual financial framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_285"> It is my intention to travel to Paris later this month for a bilateral meeting with President Hollande, and to Berlin in November for a meeting with Chancellor Merkel. While I have no formal plans to meet Prime Minister Katainen of Finland or Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands, I will of course see them and all my European Council colleagues at the European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday. A series of further bilateral meetings is planned before Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Council next January. EU issues were not the primary focus of my bilateral discussions at the Olympic Games in London.</p>
            <p eId="para_286"> On the question of our banking related debt, at the June summit meeting, Heads of State and Government committed to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to improving further the sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme. That commitment stands. In the period since, along with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, I have taken every appropriate opportunity to highlight to our European partners the importance of the issue for Ireland and to seek their support in ensuring the commitment made in June is honoured. Discussions on the matter are ongoing, and it would not be appropriate for me to enter into detail here. However, the House can be fully assured that our aim remains to secure the best possible deal for Ireland. I have not circulated any documents to members of the European Council since 1 July 2012, but the Government is, of course, feeding into the usual preparatory work for the European Council meeting this week, including through the discussion with President Van Rompuy at today's meeting of the General Affairs Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_287"> A new integrated European affairs division was established within my Department last year. This involved the transfer of staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who now work alongside staff who were already working in my Department. The new integrated EU affairs and co-ordination division supports me in my membership of the European Council, as well as supporting the Tánaiste in his responsibility for overall co-ordination of European policy, including his membership of the General Affairs Council. The division also provides support to the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. It secures more effective strategic direction and co-ordination across the whole of Government in all matters related to the European Union and is working intensively in preparation for our Presidency next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_290">The Taoiseach did not specifically answer Question No. 19, to ask the Taoiseach if he has spoken to any of the Prime Ministers of Finland, Germany or the Netherlands since the joint statement by their Finance Ministers on Tuesday, 26 September 2012, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_292">The Taoiseach should have put in his reply that he did not speak to them specifically. That is the key point of all the questions I have asked. Three weeks ago, those Ministers for Finance made a significant statement about their understanding of the June deal on the separation of Government debt from bank debt. It is incredible the Taoiseach has not held any discussions or contacted their leaders on the Irish position and the Irish response to that statement and that he did not take the opportunity to contact them by phone or arrange a meeting with them to make the Irish position crystal clear and have genuine dialogue at Head of State level, which is the only route to resolve the clear differences of interpretation that have emerged since the June meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> It is also an incredible admission by the Taoiseach that he has not circulated any detailed material to other leaders since June. Of course our interests will be ignored by other countries if we leave them alone and do not follow up on decisions taken by the European summit and by the leaders of Europe, and if we sit back and let the entire summer pass without any action on our part to pursue our agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_294"> Given the Taoiseach has held no discussions with their leaders, before or after the June summit, and certainly since the statement was made three weeks ago, how does he know the understanding of the Prime Ministers of those three countries of the June deal? Is the Taoiseach satisfied the Prime Ministers of Holland, Finland and Germany share the same understanding of the June decision as him? Can he explain how he knows their understanding of the deal?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_175">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_295">The statement by the three Ministers for Finance is just that - a statement by three, albeit influential, Ministers. The Irish Government was in touch immediately with the offices in the Netherlands, Finland and Berlin and the situation was that was a statement made by the three Ministers without reference to the Prime Ministers of the three countries involved. Departmental officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach were immediately in contact and on a number of occasions since. The European Commission, the following day, was very clear in its statement of support for the position adopted on 29 June, as was Mr. Draghi of the European Central Bank and Mr. Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, and a range of other leaders.</p>
            <p eId="para_296"> The statement was a statement from the three Ministers for Finance, but it has no bearing on the decision of the 27 Heads of Government on 29 June that the link between sovereign and bank debt should be broken. That is the decision that was made, that is the decision that stands and that is the decision that must be implemented. Clearly, within that decision was a specific reference to a review of the debt sustainability of this country and that Ireland would receive similar and fair treatment in respect of deals for any other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> Clearly, in respect of the banking union, it is necessary for recapitalisation of the banks that it be set up. The first meeting of the ESM has taken place and the Commission has lodged its proposal for banking union. When I attend the meeting on Thursday and Friday, I will make that point very strongly. It is imperative for the citizens of the countries of the European Union that the decisions taken by the highest governing body of the Union, the 27 Heads of Government, be followed through and be seen to be followed through. That is an issue on which the Minister for Finance and officials from all Departments have been working diligently over the past period in addition to ongoing discussions on the legacy position as far as the promissory note is concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_298"> Just because three Ministers for Finance of individual countries make a statement, it does not mean I must contact each of the Heads of Government. It was confirmed clearly to Ireland that the statement was not carrying the <i>imprimatur</i> of the governments of these countries. I intend to meet the German Minister for Finance when he visits Ireland shortly. The Minister for Finance has met him, along with other colleagues, in Paris, Rome, Berlin, as well as in Cyprus, to discuss these matters, and politically they are aware of the decision of 29 June and the importance of implementing it. I hope the meeting on Thursday and Friday can make good progress in this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_299">I agree it is imperative decisions be followed up. It is the lack of follow through on the part of the Taoiseach that baffles me. It is incredible he did not feel the need to ring the leaders concerned at the very minimum. This was no ordinary statement. It was a serious and profound statement by three senior Ministers for Finance from three very important countries whose interpretation of the June summit meeting decision is in contrast with our interpretation of it and the interpretation the Taoiseach spun at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_300">At the very least the leaders concerned should have been contacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_301"> The Taoiseach has made strong statements since but to a home audience. He stamped his foot at the Burlington Hotel and said this is not on and that the deal must be followed through. He did the same at the convention centre on Thursday at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce dinner. I respectfully put it to the Taoiseach that there is not much value in speaking to a home audience in the Burlington Hotel on this issue, it is to the capitals concerned that the strong statements need to be made. Statements of this importance should be nipped in the bud and clear markers should be put down by communicating with the leaders of those countries. How does the Taoiseach know that the statement was made without reference to the prime ministers? He did not ask them that question, he is surmising that. Why is it left to officials all the time?</p>
            <p eId="para_302"> When elected Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny waited longer than any of his predecessors to hold a direct meeting with a European colleague and since then he has continued the policy of reducing bilaterals to a minimum. What is behind this hands-off policy? Why did the Taoiseach not telephone the leaders concerned in the aftermath of what any objective assessment would consider to be a significant statement on the separation of bank debt from Government debt, the legacy issue and so forth, which has implications not only for Ireland but other countries as well? What is clear from all his replies today is a sense of lack of engagement with those key countries who have raised doubts and have given a completely different perspective and a different interpretation of the decision in June. Why did the Taoiseach not telephone them? At any stage at which he has spoken to the other leaders, has he ever raised the issue of the non-secured non-guaranteed banking debt?</p>

            <p eId="para_303">The Government of which the Deputy was a member has much to answer for in that regard. The Deputy seems to think that I should spend my time telephoning other leaders or travelling around because he says so. I am interested in results. A process has continued for quite some time, which I have outlined previously. The day after I was elected as Taoiseach and went to my first Council meeting I was asked by a number of leaders to reduce Ireland's corporation tax rate and I refused.</p>

            <p eId="para_306">The Deputy could easily have asked why I did not telephone them and mention this issue. The point is there was not going to be an interest rate reduction, a temporary bail-out mechanism, a permanent bail-out mechanism, a second bail-out for Greece, or the realisation of direct recapitalisation of banks by breaking the link between sovereign and bank debt. As the Deputy is aware those things do not happen just like that, there is a process that has to be gone through involving much detailed interaction with officials on all sides, but it is the leaders who have the responsibility to make the decision. The decision of 29 June was clear. I made that point to President Barroso when I met him but it is not the function of the Commission to implement it. However, the European Council which is chaired by President van Rompuy has to be seen to implement it. Clearly the decision of 29 June refers to a situation in Ireland which is a legacy debt involving issues that happened in the past. The decision of 29 June was not put in place to bail out a given country in ten years time; it was to break the link between sovereign and banks in order that banks could be recapitalised directly under a banking union with a supervisory role. In the case of this country, named specifically, it was not because a bailout might be required at some future date, it is because of the legacy issue that arose here and so far as my contribution is concerned, I want others to understand the crushing burden placed upon the backs of taxpayers by the incompetence of the party in Government of which the Deputy is a member.</p>

            <p eId="para_308">That is the legacy. As I said previously in respect of the FOI request about the guarantees, the Deputy when in Government had all the information - faxes, e-mails and everything else, all of which were meaningless. There is no evidence in my Department of what was said when the biggest decision ever was made. As the Deputy is aware, person after person of great influence has said this was a disastrous deal - the so called cheapest bailout in the world.</p>

There is a process by which the leaders arrive at decisions that impact on us. The big decision that has to be implemented is that of 29 June, breaking the link between sovereign and bank; that is what will benefit Ireland. I assure the Deputy I will raise the issue directly on Thursday and Friday because that is the decision that stands, that is the decision that was made and signed off on by 27 leaders of the European Union. It is why it is imperative that the people of the European Union see that the decisions made by leaders are signed off and implemented. Failure to do so-----</p>

For our part, I will be very happy indeed to make this case very strongly in addition to the constant negotiations by the Minister for Finance and on a daily basis by officials from the Departments of Finance, the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade. The process in Europe involves a great deal of that interaction. The leaders having made the decision, it is a case of seeing it is implemented. That is where our focus lies. I will articulate that very strongly when I attend the meeting on Thursday and Friday.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_320">At this stage I am not sure whether the Taoiseach is being humiliated by the powers that be in the European Union or if he is playing some grand trick on the people with promises of debt relief and also some relief on the crippling burden imposed by the European Union in order to protect the bankers and bondholders when he knows well we are getting nothing. Whatever the truth of the matter, the people are being humiliated and crushed with the austerity that the European Union demands in order to protect the bankers and bondholders. It is insisting that they are protected at all costs regardless of the consequences for ordinary people, vulnerable sectors, workers, the unemployed, the disabled and the young. All of those things matter not a jot to the European Union so long as the bankers are paid back.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> All of that might be excused if there was some sign that it was working. We have heard from virtually every official source in the past week or two that what we have been saying on this side of the House for the past two years is right, that the impact of cuts and austerity will not help the economy recover but is doing critical damage to the economy and the European economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_322">The latest announcement was on the British economy. Its equivalent of the fiscal advisory council advised that its predictions for growth in the British economy and for the impact of austerity on Britain's economy have been exactly 100% wrong, just as the fiscal advisory council and the IMF have admitted that their predictions of the impact of austerity on this economy have been 100% wrong, which is precisely what we have been saying for the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_323"> The Taoiseach can rubbish us as he does - it seems to be his standard tactic to rubbish the criticisms of the left. Is he now saying that the IMF, the Office for Budget Responsibility in Britain and the fiscal advisory council are wrong in saying that the impact of austerity over the past two years has been much worse - by a margin of 100% - than the Taoiseach told this House and the public it would be? At what point will he admit he and powers that be in Europe were wrong, and that the prescription to help the economy of Europe, including this country, to recover has turned out not to be medicine but poison that is destroying our prospects for economic growth?</p>
            <p eId="para_324"> When will he take that message to Europe? When will he stand up and be counted, and side with the ordinary people, who are taking to the streets in Europe, saying that this is wrong, not working and is the road to disaster? Is there any point on the trajectory towards economic depression when the Taoiseach will finally put up his hands and admit this is not working and that we need an alternative strategy? Is it that despite the crocodile tears he sheds, secretly the Taoiseach, along with the Chancellor Merkel, is fully behind imposing austerity onto ordinary people because the real agenda is not to help the European economy recover or get debt relief but to asset strip countries, such as this, of its health service, education, natural resources, oil and forests, as is being done in Greece, Portugal and Spain? That is what is happening. Behind all the rhetoric and all the fine words at European Council meetings and in this Chamber, what is happening on the ground for ordinary people is a series of cuts and privatisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_328">We take every opportunity to engage with our European colleagues about the improving conditions - albeit challenging - for us in Ireland. The IMF report the Deputy mentioned specifically mentioned Ireland as one of the few countries with an improving growth rate of 1.4%. The fiscal advisory council recommended that more challenging decisions be made to reach our deficit target at an earlier date. The Government has set out its programme. We have a memorandum of understanding with the troika, which funds us on an emergency basis. That memorandum of understanding has been changed through negotiation and a sense of trust between the two Ministers and the troika to good effect. Examples include the change in the minimum wage; the removal of more than 300,000 people from liability for the universal social charge; the opportunity to reduce VAT rates in the hospitality sector and thereby create 6,000 jobs; the non-raising of income tax, which would be an obstacle to creating jobs; and the continued foreign direct investment. That investment arises because of the stability of the 12.5% corporation tax rate. There have been announcements by organisations such as Paddy Power and the Kerry Group, and others will be made in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_329"> I do not accept the Deputy's argument that this is a case of destroying our country. The Deputy should consider what we have done in the past 18 months in the reforms and restructuring the Government has set out to do as part of our programme. It is designed to deal with our public finances at home and to negotiate more favourable terms from a European perspective both in regard to the promissory note legacy, which as the Deputy knows required a payment of €3 billion a year for ten years, and in regard to the major decision made by the 27 Heads of Government to break the link between sovereign debt and bank debt. That was considerable progress made by the European Union and we now need to see it implemented in terms of what it can mean for this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> Nobody from this side has ever said that this would mean a particular amount on a particular date. What has been pointed out is that we need to get the best deal possible for our taxpayers. We got the agreement of the troika that the proceeds from any State assets the Government decides to sell can be ploughed back into sustainable development, employment and job opportunities. There has been increased economic activity in this city in the past 12 months, with the throughput of so many people and the benefits to the local economy. Things have improved but clearly we still have a long way to go. The time ahead is challenging although the prize is great.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> I do not accept the argument the Deputy makes. He comes in and rants and raves with his histrionics and fantasy economics every week. Yesterday in Sligo I witnessed the Croke Park agreement in action. The Department of Social Protection now has staff including people transferred from the HSE and FÁS. Those people, who are unfortunately unemployed and drawing social protection benefits in one way or another, will now have a whole new opportunity to change direction and to have provided for them an opportunity to achieve work. Rather than having the old concept of the dole office as a place where someone goes to get the money and then leaves, a very different process is being put in train here. These people can be encouraged, their experience can be noted and their talent or motivation to better themselves can be given an opportunity to be followed through. Whether it be in a local office or at a European level, the strategy of the Government is the same - to improve the lot of our people, to deal with restructuring and reform so that we can have our public finances put in order and to continue to negotiate with our colleagues in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> This would have been sorted out long ago if Ireland was the only problem. Clearly the Spanish economy has difficulties and that is a much larger economy than ours. The growing interest in Catalonia for independence is a matter of concern to the Spanish Prime Minister. Clearly the economy of Italy is enormous. The economy of Greece and others are challenging. The conclusion of implementing the decision of 29 June has different implications for those countries. The EU Commission has published its paper on banking union. The first element of that is expected to be in place by 1 January - I hope it can be. While Commissioner Rehn felt it might be possible to conclude Ireland's element of this bank sustainability review by the end of October, I always said it is more important to get it right in terms of the maximum benefit for the people than to have it completed by a particular date.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> I assure the Deputy that the ongoing discussions and negotiations are intense and complex. I am not one for suggesting we will not get a conclusion here. The big decision has been made. It now needs to be implemented and that is where our focus at leader level will be.</p>

            <p eId="para_336">Is it not the case that the IMF has now officially acknowledged that its forecasts were the fantasies? These were the forecasts on which the Government based its policies because the troika demanded it.</p>
            <p eId="para_337">The growth which the troika predicted has not materialised because of the crucifying level of austerity imposed on our people and economy. Not only has it not materialised in Ireland, the crippling effect of austerity is now spreading from the core into the centre of Europe, including in the United Kingdom, our biggest trading partner. Regardless of how competitive our export industry is, if people in Europe have less money in their pockets because of the austerity being imposed on them, our ability to export our way out of this crisis will be choked off. This is precisely the reason the forecasts are being downgraded, which throws everything off. That is a fact. I am not the only person saying this, as the Taoiseach knows.</p>

            <p eId="para_339">Despite this, the Government proposes to continue with the same austerity. The Taoiseach is living in fantasy land in terms of his speaking about investment in jobs when there are 33,000 fewer jobs than last year in the economy, there is less overall investment than there was a few years ago and ordinary people are being hammered, with their living standards and purchasing power, along with the domestic economy, declining.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> Will the Taoiseach now admit what the IMF, the chief architects of this austerity, has admitted, namely, that austerity is not working, that we need an alternative path and that the myth that this level of austerity and growth were compatible, as peddled by the Taoiseach and IMF, is not correct? It is not possible to cut one's way out of a recession. That is official. It is not only the left but the mainstream parties who are saying this now. If this is the case, the Taoiseach needs to stand up and fight rather than meekly submit to the demand that we suffocate under debt and austerity. He needs to say that we will no longer do this because it is killing us, which means as of next year, we will have a primary surplus in this country, with the deficit being all interest on debt. That is the card we must play.</p>

            <p eId="para_367">One of my questions was what issues the Taoiseach planned to place on the agenda for the European Council meeting, which I do not believe he answered. Another question was if he intends to circulate any position papers to other European leaders, to which if I recall it correctly, the Taoiseach replied "No". That is disappointing.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> The Taoiseach has a point when he says just because a Minister for Finance makes a statement does not mean he has to get in touch with the prime minister of the state in question. I would like to explore the issue of banking debt with the Taoiseach. In this case, the so-called Helsinki Three, namely, the Ministers for Finance in Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, contradicted the Irish Government's version of the deal done in relation to Irish bank debt. I do not understand why in that case the Taoiseach did not contact their leaders for an explanation or, from his point of view, reassurance that his interpretation of the deal was the correct one. The Taoiseach's interpretation, following his return to this House after the European Council meeting, was that it was a seismic shift. The Tánaiste described it as "a game changer". The Taoiseach told this House and the people that this deal would lift the burden of bank debt from them and that it was to be retrospective. This has been contradicted by the three Ministers for Finance mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> The new chief of the ESM when asked about this last week said: "This part has not been discussed by any European bodies." This interpretation also contradicts that of the Government. Following the June summit, Sinn Féin warned against over-selling the implications of the agreement. I think the Taoiseach was very hard on Deputy Boyd Barrett. His opinions are as valid as anybody else. If the Government secures a deal to lift the banking debt from the people, I will welcome it. Sinn Féin is on record welcoming all the positive developments announced this week. When the Government does something which we believe is good, we welcome it. That is first class for everybody. However, when it is not doing what it is supposed to do, we disagree with it. The Taoiseach must accept this is a valid position.</p>
            <p eId="para_370"> The Taoiseach said the Government has long argued for the separation of bank and sovereign debt. That is not the case. Sinn Féin argued from the first day for separation of bank and sovereign debt, which the Taoiseach rubbished.</p>
            <p eId="para_371">He stated Ireland would pay its way and that we would not have the word "defaulter" stamped on our foreheads. He argued against us every time we raised it. It was only when the new French President was elected and took up the same position as us that the Taoiseach began to U-turn on the issue. It is little wonder the Taoiseach has not resolved this issue. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Government continues to pay out, with another €1 billion being paid this month. Will the Taoiseach set out the strategy to remove the burden of bad debt from our people? Is the issue even on the agenda for this week's summit meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_374">I will lay out some of the groundwork for Deputy Adams during the pre-Council discussion we will have later. I spoke directly to President Van Rompuy. It is fundamental that decisions made by Heads of Government are followed through. The decision was not made by the German, Dutch or Finnish Ministers for Finance. The decision was made by the 27 Prime Ministers, and the Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Ministers of Finland and the Netherlands were party to the decision. The decision, which was very clear, was to break the link between sovereign and bank debt and to look at Ireland's improving position in the context of its debt sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> The implication of the decision was that banks could be recapitalised directly through the ESM. The ESM has had its first board meeting and for this to happen, a banking union with a supervisory role must commence its work and the intention was that this should happen by 1 January. Of course there are divisions on whether it will cover all 6,000 banks in the first instance or have responsibility for the major banks. I remind the Deputy that it was not a major bank which caused the problem here which has required €64 billion to be pumped into the banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> In the context of the confusion, concern and anxiety in Europe, it is of critical importance that European leaders revisit the decision made on 29 June and examine what has happened since that can now be progressed by the leadership of the 27 member states to follow through on the decision made and see it is implemented. The ESM has held a meeting and the Commission has launched a paper on banking union. Implementing the decision will have a benefit for the country, the scale of which we do not yet know because it must be finally decided. We will look for the maximum benefit possible for our people and country.</p>
            <p eId="para_377"> The decision was made at the highest level of European governance comprising the leaders of the 27 member states. I look forward to participating in the debate on Thursday and Friday on behalf of the Government with the other 26 Heads of Government, and building on the negotiations that have already taken place. I will articulate this very strongly. This discussion will happen and it is on the agenda. I made it perfectly clear to President Van Rompuy that I will raise this matter and that I regard the decision as clearly including Ireland's position of legacy debt. The decision made on 29 June reflects this. I cannot speak for the Spanish Prime Minister on what is happening today with regard to the Spanish position, but for direct recapitalisation to take place the banking supervisory capacity must be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> I referred to it being a seismic shift because it had never been done before at European level and there were those who said it could never happen. Deputy Adams stated the IMF and the ECB should get lost and get out of here. The people in his constituency would then not receive their payments and neither would the country. We have funding arrangements, unfortunately, with the troika of the IMF, ECB and the Commission and this will continue as long as we continue to meet our requirements and make our way towards exiting the bailout programme. We hope to be the first country that can do so, and our colleagues in Europe can help us in this regard by implementing the decision of 29 June. Separate from this, as the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance and officials are continually working on the question of the difficulties our people face because of the promissory note which we inherited and which requires a €30,000 million payment over ten years. This is a complex matter which is under discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> We will have a discussion after this on the European Council meeting, but central to my participation on Thursday and Friday will be the discussion on following through on the decision already made. It is not as if we have to make the decision; it is done and signed. Let us see that the 27 member states follow it through and implement it. For our part, when it becomes apparent we will see what benefits can accrue for the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_380">I am very pleased the issue is on the agenda and this is to be commended. If I understand the Taoiseach properly, he stated the leaders of the European Union have signed up to deal with the banking debt including our legacy debt. If this is his interpretation of it, what we need is delivery of the agreement. In his reply the Taoiseach spoke about the implications of this, which is a slightly different issue to the clarity with which he described this as being about dealing with Irish legacy debt. I wish the Taoiseach well in all of this, do not get me wrong. I am sure the Taoiseach wants to see the IMF out of here. We all do. We are in agreement on different points of our objectives. It is how we achieve it and go about it which are the big issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_381"> The Taoiseach has been contradicted, and his interpretation of the agreement has been contradicted by others, and it looks like the summit will be a fairly fractious affair. There is talk about there being no agreement between the Greek government and the EU and IMF on cuts in that state. Finland is expressing grave concern about new budget proposals. I do not have the time to go through all of the issues which are features of the media coverage. Here is the rub. Between them, the present and previous Governments borrowed €67 billion and gave €64 billion to the banks, including to one bank which is closed and is subject to criminal proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_382">The people of the State are carrying the burden of that. In his answer, the Taoiseach did not explain what the Government's strategy is for crunching. He said the agreement has already been made so we do not have to remake it. It is a matter of implementing that agreement. Could he, and I ask this fraternally, explain how he intends to do that?</p>

            <p eId="para_384">I intend to articulate to the other 26 leaders the necessity of implementing the decision of 29 June. That means we must make progress on setting up the banking union with the supervisory role because the banks cannot be recapitalised directly until that happens. Our starting point is the decision that has been made and the fact that the ESM has had its first board meeting and the Commission has set out its proposals for banking union. So for this to become a reality, that banking union must be put in place. As I said earlier, there are arguments about whether it should be put in place for the 6,000 banks or as a starting point with major banks, which are obviously smaller in number. There are different views about this. I spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Monti, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Mariano Rajoy, and the Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, who all have different views about when it should be implemented and the scope it should have at the beginning. That is a matter for discussion. That is the strategy we want to follow through and there have been a great deal of discussions at official level before getting to that point. I expect the leaders to reflect on what decisions can be taken on Thursday and Friday as a result of the work that has taken place since June in preparing for that to become a reality. Clearly, it is only then that we can determine what the benefit will be for Ireland, which we want to be the maximum amount possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_385">What is the Taoiseach's perspective on the development of the general eurozone economy over the next period of one or two years? Is he aware of and has he engaged in discussions with his European colleagues about the fact that the eurozone is beginning to plunge into a new recession? Gross domestic product grew by 0% in the first quarter of this year and fell by 0.2% in quarter two and Germany is now predicted to face a recession. Is this not a very serious prospect for the countries of the eurozone and is it not proof that the austerity policies employed with a vengeance in the so-called peripheral countries but also applied generally are a complete failure? Is not Greece, unfortunately, proof positive of that?</p>
            <p eId="para_386"> In respect of economic questions and the impact of this eurozone economic situation on this country, could I advise the Taoiseach to be careful when he abuses and lectures people on the left on economic policies?</p>

            <p eId="para_388">I stood over there some time ago and one of the Taoiseach's predecessors spoke in the same terms. In fact, he expressed a wish that I be banished to Cahirciveen for alleged failed economic policies. A few years' later, former Deputy Ahern's policies went down in flames. I put it to the Taoiseach that it is he who is engaging in fantasy economics when he mentioned one growth rate, which refers to gross national product, thereby covering up the real economy as expressed by gross domestic product and the indicators of the collapse in investment and consumer spending, 14,000 less jobs in quarter three than quarter two and, to the Taoiseach's shame, having to go back to the 1800s to find comparable levels of emigration. It is the Taoiseach who is engaging in the politics of illusion. He is either delusional or taking lines from spin doctors and repeating them, which is even worse.</p>

            <p eId="para_389">I think the Deputy get those figures mixed up. The figure of 1.4% referred to GDP and not GNP. Deputy Higgins would not normally go to Cahirciveen but to Dingle where he would find the air from the Atlantic to be even fresher. Why would he not do so as a native son of the great county?</p>

            <p eId="para_391">There is no question that there are serious concerns about developments in Europe and much larger countries in the global economy. China has its own difficulties and there are emerging difficulties in other countries. The United States faces challenges in the time ahead and, clearly, countries within the eurozone have a range of difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_392"> On the other hand, Deputy Higgins is well aware of the potential of the Single Market and that if countries work together with their people and follow a clear path to getting their own houses in order, their economies can grow and get the benefit of a Single Market of 500 million people. Countries on the periphery, including those into Africa, are now growing at the rate of 5%, 6% and 7% with enormous potential for exports and job opportunities. The Deputy is aware that export figures in the agriculture sector have increased with clear implications for growth in our economy. Things are not as bad as the Deputy often paints them. It is not for me to lecture the left or any other group and I have no intention of doing so. Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that I disagree fundamentally with him on a regular basis but his view as an elected Member is as valid as that of anybody. The question of whether it is true is a different matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> When I spoke to the Greek Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, he spelt out the nature of the challenge facing people in Greece and made the point that they were looking for an extension of two years from the troika to deal with their problems over a four-year period. The Portuguese Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, has a different set of challenges, including those not directly related to the economy here. The French President, François Hollande, has put through his budget and has a range of other issues to deal with and the Italian economy must turn over €20 billion per month. So the situation in the eurozone is of concern because of the extent and extended period of this recession. If other economies cannot purchase, the traffic lights back up and we cannot export, which has implications for us. However, they regard this country as one that is making steady progress towards achieving and retrieving its economic independence, getting out of the bailout programme and moving on. We want this to happen as quickly as possible. I note the successful return to the bond markets earlier this year and the fact that yields have fallen from over 14% to less than 5%, deposits are coming back into the banks and foreign direct investment is strong. However, I do not doubt the scale of the challenge we face and, as Deputy Boyd Barrett and others have noted, I meet with people who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs and are unemployed and looking for opportunities. This is why I was happy to attend an event with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, yesterday in Sligo that aimed to start a new process for people who can make a contribution to the local economy and their lives and have opportunities based on their talent and experience and what they can learn. It is not a case of just one country having a set of problems; there are a number of problems associated with countries in Europe. The decisions by the Council on Thursday and Friday will focus on that and, hopefully, some more progress can be made.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_357">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_514">The meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday of this week will represent a welcome opportunity to take stock of developments in relation to a range of economic policy matters. The meeting will also provide leaders with an opportunity for an exchange of views on the European Union's relations with its strategic partners without the constraint of seeking to agree a set of conclusions on this issue. The EU's relationship with China will feature prominently in those discussions. It is expected that we will also discuss foreign policy matters, including possibly the evolving situation in Syria. I think that it is fair to say that this week's summit meeting will, for the most part, be of a preparatory nature, with our deliberations following up on previous developments and feeding into decisions to be taken at future meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> It is worth noting at the start that this week's meeting of the European Council will not address the issue of the Union's budget over the period 2014-20, the so-called multi-annual financial framework. President Van Rompuy has convened a special separate meeting of the European Council for 22-23 November at which it is intended an agreement will be reached on this critical piece of business. Ireland will support the work of the Cypriot Presidency and of President Van Rompuy and his office to ensure the success of that meeting. I will, of course, brief the House in advance of next month's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Under the economic policy heading, EU Heads of State and Government will focus on reviewing progress in the implementation of the compact for growth and jobs and on engaging with President Van Rompuy on his interim report on strengthening the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU. The banking union, particularly the proposals for a single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks, will form an important part of the latter discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The compact for growth and jobs, which we agreed in June, is an important reinforcement of political commitment in this area and provides a clear framework for actions at national and EU levels. The key task that we face in the period ahead is driving it forward with real commitment and momentum. That will be the focus of this week's discussion. Of course, the compact also supports a vital national interest. The reality is that Irish recovery depends on European recovery. Europe will have recovered from the current crisis only when our economies are growing again and creating jobs. That is why we see the compact becoming a key driver of the Irish Presidency programme. It will underpin crucial work on our primary growth and jobs priorities, including further unlocking the potential of the Single Market, including the digital single market; deepening the Union's external trade relations, including with key strategic partners such as the US, Japan and China; progressing the youth transitions package being produced by the Commission in December; and managing effectively the third European semester cycle of economic and fiscal policy co-ordination.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> It is clear that one of the major challenges facing Europe at the moment is the high rate of unemployment, especially youth unemployment. The Commission will put forward a youth transitions package, including a youth guarantee, later this year and we will seek to prioritise work on this during our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The promotion of the Single Market will be central to Ireland's Presidency agenda. A recent assessment by President Van Rompuy of progress on the 12 so-called levers of the first round of Commission proposals under the Single Market Act shows that, as the deadline of the end of the year for their agreement approaches, the picture is a very mixed one. In particular, unless real momentum is injected, despite the considerable efforts of the Danish and Cypriot Presidencies there is a danger that only half of the levers will be agreed. We are falling short in areas as various as public procurement, professional qualifications and energy. I will be making my strong support for early progress clear at this week's meeting and stressing that advancing the Single Market will be at the heart of our efforts as President in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> The Commission has now brought forward its second round of proposals under the Single Market Act. These have the real potential to contribute in a meaningful way to our efforts to secure jobs, growth and investment, and I look forward to early progress on them. It goes without saying that the Government supports these further efforts to improve the operation and governance of the Single Market as the cornerstone of the Union and as a lever for increasing competitiveness, growth, productivity and mobility in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The effects of Single Market fragmentation are felt most strongly within the small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector. We are particularly supportive, therefore, of measures that assist SMEs, including through improving their access to long-term investment funds and tackling disproportionate "red tape".</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> The outcome of the mid-term review of the digital agenda for Europe is expected by the end of 2012 and, therefore, the follow through will fall into Ireland's Presidency. It presents an important opportunity to assess the delivery of the digital single market to date, allowing member states to address any shortcoming and to redouble efforts towards implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> A further critical issue for the Union is how to respond to the challenge of getting the European economy back on track by improving the EU's global competitiveness, promoting economic growth and creating jobs. Research and innovation are, therefore, of major importance, given their potential role in contributing to economic recovery, competitiveness and growth across the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> We also see the potential for trade to be a real driver of growth and will work to try and make progress on a number of fronts. We will prioritise the development of EU-US trade during our semester as Presidency, including with an informal ministerial meeting on this theme in Dublin in the spring.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> As we have followed our path through the economic and financial crisis, it has become increasingly clear that the euro needs to be grounded on the foundations of a strengthened EMU. Under President Van Rompuy, we are in the process of carefully assessing what needs to be done. Only then can we move to determining how best to take those steps forward. It is crucially important that we get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> We need to ensure that, over the years ahead, the Union develops the ways and means of strengthening the underpinnings of our shared currency through an enhanced EMU. As recent years have all too clearly illustrated, this process of developing what President Van Rompuy has termed a "genuine" EMU is not an optional extra. This is an exercise that is critical to the stability and well being of the euro area and, indeed, the entire European Union. It is, of course, critical to Ireland's economic and financial well being into the future. A stable euro is fundamental to our national interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> The House will recall that European Council President Van Rompuy presented his initial "vision for the future of Economic and Monetary Union" to the June European Council meeting. In response, he was asked by leaders to develop his thinking in close co-operation with the Presidents of the Commission, ECB and euro group, and to return with a "time-bound roadmap for the achievement of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union".</p>
          <p eId="para_528">He will present his interim report to this week's meeting of the European Council and his final report to the December European Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I welcome the consultations that have taken place over the last months between President Van Rompuy and Presidents Barroso, Juncker and Draghi, but also with representatives of member states and the European Parliament. President Van Rompuy's interim report, which was published on Friday, 12 October, is all the stronger for having had the benefit of a wide range of inputs. I very much welcome and endorse the recognition in the interim report that moving forward on the integrated financial framework, the so-called banking union - especially the single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks - is a political priority. I would add to that and say that it is of pressing urgency not just for Ireland, but for the euro area as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> In June, we agreed that breaking the sovereign-banking link was imperative. I worked hard with my colleagues to achieve that acknowledgement and we must now ensure that we deliver on that undertaking. Having set out our stall in this way, expectations are now high that we will deliver, and this is a real credibility test for the Union. Be in no doubt that we will be punished for any back-sliding or stepping away from what has been agreed. I am encouraged by the steps already taken, and the Commission brought forward last month the formal legislative proposals for a single supervisory mechanism. The draft European Council conclusions recognise that we are still aiming for agreement on the single supervisory mechanism by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> If the Union is to be credible, commitments entered into at the level of Heads of State or Government must be honoured. I am confident that will be the case. I welcome the fact that the draft conclusions being worked on in preparation for our meeting later this week, including at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg today, at which a Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, is representing Ireland, call on the euro group of finance Ministers to draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, "in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area summit statement". This is a vital anchor for the work ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The recognition in President Van Rompuy's interim report, that once a single supervisor is in place, a common resolution mechanism is required, is also welcome. I strongly support the need for swift progress to make these steps a reality. The interim report rightly recognises the important steps we have taken towards stronger economic governance, both in terms of developing an integrated budgetary framework and an integrated economic policy framework, since the outbreak of the crisis. We now have a broad range of instruments at our disposal, including the six-pack, the two-pack, the stability treaty, the enhanced Stability and Growth Pact and the European semester and Euro Plus pact. We must ensure that we implement, in full, what we have already agreed, or are in the process of finalising, before we seek to open new opportunities. Implementation must remain our priority. It is regrettable that sometimes it can seem easier to agree on new mechanisms even before we have seen how our existing tools work in practice. I will continue to press for implementation of what we already have at every level.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> President Van Rompuy has sought a mandate over the coming months to explore further a number of new possibilities suggested in his interim report, including a possible "fiscal capacity" for the euro area and possible "contracts" between member states and the EU institutions, perhaps covering the country-specific recommendations generated as part of the European semester process. These ideas, while potentially interesting, need to be fleshed out so we can be clear on what might be involved. They raise many questions and complex issues but they may ultimately have a contribution. I look forward to hearing more from President Van Rompuy later in the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I caution that we need to be very careful that any "fiscal capacity" must not cut across the ongoing negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework. Concluding those negotiations is an immediate priority. Agreement would send a positive signal of the Union's willingness and ability to reach a compromise on something as fundamental as the funding of the EU over the seven-year period from 2014. We must not deflect ourselves from that goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> Democratic legitimacy and accountability is the fourth building block identified by President Van Rompuy. This must not be an afterthought, and on the contrary, it must be central to our work in strengthening the EMU. We in Ireland know better than anyone across Europe that democratic legitimacy and accountability is not an optional extra but must be standard equipment. We need to pursue a balanced approach in this regard in addition to any enhanced role for the European Parliament. National parliaments, including the Oireachtas, must be central to whatever mechanisms we seek to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> In his final report to the December European Council, President Van Rompuy will examine "what can be done within the existing treaties, and which measures would require treaty change" as he sets out a roadmap to strengthening EMU. In this regard Ireland's position is similar to that of the great majority of member states that wish to see the Union make the maximum possible use of the wide range of instruments available to it. Discussion of the possibility of treaty change at some stage in the future must not be allowed distract us from getting on with what needs to be done now. I note that the Government strongly holds that any new arrangements, including those adopted under the existing treaties, must avoid fragmentation of the Union and maintain the integrity of the Single Market. In a larger Union there will sometimes be areas in which some member states, including those who share a common currency, will wish to go further together. This must respect key principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> The European Council will this week further consider the EU's relations with its strategic partners, focussing in particular on the relationship with China. Since the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, High Representative Catherine Ashton has sought to enhance the effectiveness of the Union's engagement with key partners, such as China, the US, Russia, India and Brazil. An enhanced framework for summit preparation has provided momentum to this process and there has been progress towards assuring what she has described as "fewer priorities, greater coherence and more results".</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> The discussion on China is timely as it comes shortly after the most recent EU-China summit in Brussels on 20 September. The summit, which was Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's last before he steps down, reflected on the great progress that has been achieved in the past ten years. The relationship has become increasingly rich and multi-dimensional and covers areas such as trade, global challenges, human rights and agriculture. The EU believes that the principles of openness, fairness and predictability should be a corner stone in our relations with China. We should be firm yet fair in applying the rules that govern international trade. The recent EU-China summit confirmed both sides' commitment to launching negotiations for an EU-China investment agreement. Such an agreement would facilitate investment in both directions and should, we hope, result in an additional source of growth and employment in this country, following on from our own strategic partnership signature with China.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Ireland has entered a new phase of engagement with China following my visit there earlier this year and subsequent visits by a number of Ministers. The announcement that Ireland and China were establishing a strategic partnership has moved our relationship to a new level. With two-way trade between Ireland and China already at nearly €8 billion, the potential for this partnership is evident. Together with my colleagues in Government, I will continue to work to realise that potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> The European Council may also consider a number of other items, particularly in the sphere of foreign policy. The evolving situation in Syria may be included on our agenda in light of discussions at yesterday's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, at which the Tánaiste represented Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> This week's meeting of the European Council presents us with an opportunity to consolidate and build upon the important progress that the Union has made over recent months in both bringing a degree of stability to our common currency and in looking ahead to sketch out what kind of economic and monetary Union we will need for a stable and prosperous future. I trust the meeting will offer important impetus to our efforts in building upon the compact for growth and jobs; progressing banking union, with its clear link to the direct recapitalisation of euro area banks by the ESM; and provide us with an opportunity to reflect calmly on the EU's relations with our strategic partners, especially with China. As ever, I will play a full and active part in the deliberations at this week's European Council meeting and I look forward to reporting back to the House next week upon my return.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_542">Since the leaders of Europe last met they have yet again failed to show the urgency or vision required to tackle this unprecedented economic crisis. Having announced that they had made a "decisive" breakthrough, they then entered into three months of backtracking by some countries and inaction by others.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_7">The strategy adopted by many of the leaders, including the Taoiseach, was to return to the issue in October but that strategy has failed to progress the work of the summit.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_8"> Were it not for the actions of Mario Draghi, there is no doubt that we would be in the middle of another panic. With his decision to face down the destructive orthodoxies of the Bundesbank, a major step was taken to restore at least some long-term confidence in the sovereign bond market. It was a move which came three years too late. Ireland and Portugal would have avoided the need for international support if the OMT facility had been in place in 2010. Spain would not have seen the mounting pressure of the past year and others would have had to divert fewer resources to rising interest payments. In contrast to the way Jean Claude Trichet was conservative and restrictive, Mario Draghi has been aggressive and ambitious. Unfortunately, he appears to be against a major move on dealing with the Irish promissory notes, a matter to which I will return.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_9"> In the three months since the June summit, there has been no significant progress on any matter within the competence of the European Council. There has been no progress on a banking union, on structural reform, on the Union's budget or on debt sustainability. Unfortunately, there have been significant steps backwards. The joint statement of three finance Ministers setting limits to their interpretation of the agreement reached in June was the logical outcome of lack of preparation which preceded the negotiation and the failure of countries, such as Ireland, to engage with them intensively in the weeks after the summit. At the same time as they were issuing their statement, our Government was briefing journalists that everything was going well and on course for delivery in October. There is no reason to believe that this week's summit will mark a significant step forward.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_10"> The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have undertaken no diplomatic initiative in recent weeks and have tabled no proposals for the summit. Given that the Taoiseach has not supplied any material for this debate, it is necessary to seek it in Brussels. On Monday, President Van Rompuy circulated the agenda and background documents for the summit. Ireland and debt sustainability are not mentioned, the only relevant point is to be found in the document he circulated about the future of economic and monetary union. On page 3 of the document, it states: "During the transition phase [to a bank resolution scheme] and after the establishment of an effective Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ESM will have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly, relying on appropriate conditionality." This is almost word for word the interpretation of the agreement reached in June that was included in the statement of the German, Dutch and Finnish Ministers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_11"> The Taoiseach, however, has been very vocal in the Irish media banging the table and saying a deal is a deal. What is now clear to anyone who bothers to look at the evidence is that there was no agreed understanding of the agreement reached in June because no serious background work went into it. On the first night of the summit, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste agreed to move on to the next business without any agreement on banking debts. They were so convinced that nothing was happening the Tánaiste flew home.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_12"> The success of the Italian and Spanish prime ministers in demanding a new policy opened up a possibility for Ireland which was acknowledged in the final communiqué. While the Taoiseach was busy patting himself on the back and praising his negotiating skills, he once again over-spun a development. Ireland does not need the same support which Spain is seeking. Ireland wants fairness in the handling of banking-related debt which we took on in the interests of wider European solidarity and which the Taoiseach acknowledged in previous statements. The Taoiseach has consistently failed to push this argument because it gets in the way of favourite partisan attacks, of which we had an element earlier. What the Taoiseach also consistently refuses to acknowledge is that in February of last year, before the change of Government, our partners in Europe had already agreed to the principle of addressing the sustainability of our debt. Yet over a year and a half later, no major push has been made to achieve this. Time and again it has been a case of hoping that something comes along.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_13"> The promissory notes are the core of our issue. They were created as an exceptional measure to address an unprecedented situation and where the ECB and EU demanded the full honouring of these debts. The interest payments are returned to Government through the Central Bank, so it is the repayment of the principal which matters. They are not standard sovereign debt and they can be restructured in a way which lifts their unreasonable burden on the Irish people. Mario Draghi is right when he says that the European Central Bank is precluded from the simple monetary financing of government which would be involved in writing off the promissory notes. What it can do is to extend their duration markedly so that they do not oblige unreasonable and growth-destroying austerity. They are a technically complicated instrument but the solution is not particularly complicated.</summary>

          <p eId="para_544">What would be completely unacceptable would be to repeat what happened this year. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, came into this House without notice to announce a supposed breakthrough in regard to this year's repayment. All that actually happened was that a promissory note which could be restructured with little difficulty has been converted into normal sovereign debt. It took days before anyone was able to get past the Government's spin but it was and remains a bad deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> At the same time, the Government proceeded with a programme of paying off unsecured and unguaranteed bonds without comment. The tough position adopted by the late Brian Lenihan in regard to these bonds was abandoned in return for nothing at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">The ECB would like the entire debt to be converted into normal sovereign debt but we should absolutely refuse to do this. After a year and a half of false dawns, non-existent technical papers - we have never been able to get a hold of that technical paper between the troika and the Taoiseach because it probably never existed - and distractions, it is time for the Taoiseach to actually undertake the long-promised diplomatic initiative. He cannot keep waiting for others to do the work or for things to get so bad that Europe has no alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> President Van Rompuy has circulated a draft set of principles rather than decisions about the future management of economic and financial matters at European level. Most of his proposals should be strongly supported by Ireland. The proposed single supervisory mechanism, SSM, for the financial system is an obvious necessity. We should oppose attempts to limit this to just the largest pan-European banks. We should also strongly support a uniform bank resolution regime, including deposit insurance. This is being opposed in some countries on the basis that they do not want to pay for failings elsewhere. What they are missing is that one way or the other, within a currency union, one cannot expect to feel no impact from what happens in other member countries. Directly or indirectly, there will be a financial hit and it is better that the risk of this be limited by having a deposit insurance and resolution regime which gives confidence to the wider system. Just as the OMT facility has reduced everyone's cost of borrowing, it is a case where a joint guarantee makes the guarantee less likely to ever be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The document to be discussed also refers to the need for increased fiscal capacity for the euro zone. Translated into real speech, this means that there should be a larger budget which can be used to help regions with big economic problems. I welcome this proposal which has been made in the face of the opposition of stronger countries. I hope the Taoiseach will support the proposal, although his speech was somewhat ambiguous in regard to it. Without a much larger budget to transfer resources between states, the eurozone will be all about control and will fail to give a credible path to growth for all of its members. It is being proposed that leaders will agree a time-bound roadmap for agreement on reforms over the coming months. This is reasonable but it is not reasonable to exclude Parliaments and wider European society from these discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> When regular statements in advance of European Council meetings were introduced, it was a development welcomed by everyone in the House. The Taoiseach explained that it would involve a real exchange between the Government and the Opposition during which he would outline in detail the Government's approach to upcoming summits. As with nearly every piece of reform proposed by this Government, the reality has been very different. In almost 19 months of these sessions, the Taoiseach has yet to give the House a single piece of information not already in the public domain. In some cases, the Taoiseach has refused to give detailed replies to questions at exactly the same time that his staff have been sent out to provide the relevant information to a journalist - always accompanied by ridiculous and self-serving spin. On other occasions, we have had to go to Brussels to obtain information withheld by the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> In the middle of the never-ending search for short-term headlines, what has now become clear is that this Government has no European policy, except the hope that things turn out all right. It waits until outcomes become clear before saying anything and then rushes out to find new ways of praising its own efforts. The now undeniable reality is that the Taoiseach has opted out of the level of diplomatic activity within the European Union undertaken by all of his predecessors for the past 40 years. He and his senior Ministers have delegated profoundly important negotiations to officials while failing completely to outline and promote Ireland's position on nearly every fundamental issue being discussed by the Union. On issues of both immediate and longer-term importance, this non-engagement strategy has already caused damage. The failure to prepare for June's deal on sovereign debt and the further failure to follow it up has allowed an opportunity to become a new crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> Since August of last year, deep reforms of the Union designed to save it and the euro have been on the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">At no stage since then have the Taoiseach or Tánaiste stated what Ireland is specifically seeking in these reforms. During the negotiation of the fiscal treaty, the only thing they sought was that it be worded in a way to try to avoid us needing to have a referendum, something they thankfully failed in achieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Since early this year the President of the European Council has been preparing proposals for further structural reform of the Union, including possible treaty changes. These proposals are now due to be presented for fast-track negotiation. Instead of setting out a national position like every leader, the Taoiseach told the House that he would wait to see the proposals before giving his opinion. That has been the trend the whole way through, before and after the fiscal treaty referendum and now into the present set of proposals and negotiations on the reform agenda. The European Union has been the most successful multinational organisation in history. It brought peace to a conflict-riven continent and enabled living standards unimaginable in the past. It deserves to have this history acknowledged and it deserves better from its leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Greater urgency, ambition and solidarity is required if Europe is genuinely to return to growth and job creation. Leaders like the Taoiseach need to stop sitting back and start engaging with each other in a meaningful way. This week’s summit and its agenda does not reflect the seriousness of the crisis facing the Union. It is another wasted opportunity, which we may soon regret.</p>

          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_558">I wish to share time with Deputy Crowe.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> It seems that Thursday's summit of EU leaders will be dominated by the future role of the ECB as a supervisor of eurozone banks, getting eurozone member states to buy into the so-called annual contracts that will commit them to structural reform of their labour markets, welfare and pensions systems, and the creation of what has been described as a federal eurozone budget that is distinct from the EU budget. The summit is shaping up to be another quarrelsome affairs with reports today suggesting that there is little prospect of an agreement between the Greek Government and the EU and IMF on a further package of significant cuts, and that Finland is expressing grave concern about the new budget proposal. What is the Government's position on this and on the annual contract for reform of the labour market and welfare and pensions systems? Is the Taoiseach in favour of a eurozone federal budget? Is he for annual contracts to reform the labour market and the welfare and pensions system? Have these been discussed with the trade union movement and business organisations? Does the establishment of a eurozone budget not risk exacerbating the division that exists between those inside and outside the eurozone? If he agrees to such a budget, is that not another important step towards fiscal unity? Does not drive another nail into the coffin of his claim that he wants to be the Taoiseach who restores Irish sovereignty because it appears that fiscal unity of the Union and Irish sovereignty are mutually exclusive positions?</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Thursday's summit will also see the continuing battle between France and Germany over the use of austerity measures but the Taoiseach is for austerity and this is not a concern for him. That brings me to the crucial issues of bank debt. First, there is no sign of a deal on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note debt. The Government now claims that it will be March 2013 at the earliest before the matter is concluded, and last week ECB President Mario Draghi cast further doubt on potential promissory note deals. From the start of this European wide debt crisis, as I reminded the Taoiseach earlier, Sinn Féin has advocated a write-down of private bank debt. This needs to be sorted out at this summit. Bank debt needs to be separated from sovereign debt. The burden of bad banking debt - the so-called legacy issue - which was foisted on the shoulders of Irish people also needs to be removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I welcome the Government's conversion to this point of view. I have noted the Taoiseach's recent declaration that the Government had long argued for the separation of bank and sovereign debt. That patently contradicts his declaration in this Chamber last January that he would not have the word "defaulter" stamped on our foreheads and that he had not sought a debt write-down. At the time, he was for leaving Irish citizens to shoulder the burden of the bank bailout and, as other Sinn Féin spokespersons and I said at the time, that was politically, economically and morally wrong. It is good he has changed his position and I welcome that, but now he must deliver. It is imperative this debt be removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> As we discussed earlier, in June, the Government oversold the deal, which was described as "a seismic shift" and a "game changer", and I note his remarks during Taoiseach's Questions earlier about the issue of the write-down of legacy payments. That is the big question. Was there a commitment that the State would benefit from a write-down of legacy payments? European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, supports breaking the link between bank and sovereign debt but draws a distinction and refused to be drawn on legacy debt, describing the issue of putting billions into bad banks as a discussion on semantics. Last week, the new chief of the ESM said the issue had not been discussed by any European leader. It appears other leaders are rowing away and no one else is rowing in to support the Government's interpretation of the June deal. I hope the Taoiseach is right but this needs to be clarified and he has to return to the House with a clear position. That needs to be his primary objective. He repeated in his contribution comments he made in Europe a week or two ago:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_563">We must now ensure that we deliver on that undertaking. Having set our stall in this way, expectations are now high that we will deliver. Be in no doubt we will be punished for any backsliding or stepping away from what has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">There is a certain irony to this and I hope these words do not come back to haunt him; they should be stamped on his forehead. The reality is there has been no bailout for our citizens. We have endured brutal health cuts, reductions in the number of special needs assistants, cuts to child benefit and other social welfare benefits, cuts to home care packages and home help hours, the imposition of a household charge and new stealth taxes. No matter how it is spun, the budget will inflict further cuts and hardship on those least able to afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Even the IMF has concluded that austerity is not the answer to the economic difficulties of Ireland and other European states. The answer is jobs and growth. Other Sinn Féin spokespersons and I genuinely welcome the recent jobs announcements, but 33,000 jobs have been lost since the Taoiseach took up office. We would need an announcement similar to that of Paddy Power every eight days for the next year even to return to last year's jobs figures. That is a sense of the magnitude of the challenge facing us. Across the EU, 24 million citizens are unemployed with almost 500,000 in this State. Emigration is not a solution. It is a huge burden on families and communities, especially in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Last week, Sinn Féin launched a fully costed, practical series of detailed proposals to tackle the jobs crisis, a copy of which I sent to the Taoiseach. We propose a jobs stimulus plan and I commend it to him. Austerity will not work and the Taoiseach faces a big challenge to return to the House the week after next with a proper deal which writes off our bank debt.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_567">Despite assurances since the last European Council meeting, we are all still uncertain as to whether banking debt will be separated from sovereign debt and how this will come about. We heard about a seismic shift, a game changer and that a banking deal was done to separate Ireland's banking and sovereign debt. However, recently, high profile member states have moved away from the Government's June statement and there is a view that people were gilding the lily regarding what was agreed at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> The recent statement from the German, Finnish and Dutch Finance Ministers, that the agreement does not involve legacy debts, carries huge importance because the countries are the strongest triple-A rated states in Europe. Their statement was a game changer and hugely significant. The June statement will not be implemented without the support of the Germans, Dutch and the Finns. My party colleague, Deputy MacDonald, said the message from these Finance Ministers was that Ireland should get lost. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has been quoted as saying the Government is engaged in a diplomatic offensive to implement the decision of 29 June to break the link between banks and the sovereigns and to enhance the sustainability of our debt. Our concern is that the diplomatic strategy and diplomatic offensive does not appear to be working.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Irish people were told they should pass the fiscal compact treaty so as not to send a negative signal to the EU and the markets and that it would strengthen Ireland's hand in negotiations on its debt. Despite ratifying the fiscal compact, the concessions on our bank debt the Government had hoped for, on foot of ratification, may not materialise. Without any irony, we are being told that any re-negotiation would send a negative message. Ireland must get a fair deal as soon as possible. It is the Government's job to get the deal. I would warmly welcome any deal that reduces the burden working people have to pay for the gambles of bankers and speculators. As long as banking and sovereign debt are tied together, the Irish banking sector and, by consequence, the State's finances and the economy cannot function effectively in the best interest of Ireland and its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I listened to the debate on negativity. Many of us will be glued to the television screens tonight to watch the football game against the Faroe Islands. I watched the press conference with Giovanni Trapattoni yesterday. He said he had the confidence of the dressing room. I am sure the Taoiseach has the confidence of the Cabinet and his backbenchers but the difficulty is that he is losing the confidence of the fans or the people of Ireland. We want to wear the green jersey and we want to see it work. We want to see Ireland qualifying but we are not seeing the results. Perhaps, similar to Mr. Trapattoni, we need to examine the system we are using. People referred to this as a fractious meeting but perhaps we need a Shane Long for the negotiations with our European counterparts.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">It sounds silly to make the connection but the question of whether we qualify and go to Brazil means a huge deal. It will lift the spirit of the country and it will lift the spirit of the country if the Taoiseach delivers. We want to go to Brazil and we would like to see our economy like Brazil's. Its economy was a basket case a number of years ago but now it is a driver for change in South America. There are many similarities even though one involves a football game and is not serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The Taoiseach referred to the topics he will raise, one of which should be the social cost of policies. Many Governments do not understand what people are going through. The people of Greece, Spain, where they have 53% youth unemployment, and Ireland know what is going on. Deputy Adams referred to the number of people unemployed, which is approaching 500,000. This is hurting people and none of us got involved in politics in order to hurt people. We want to bring about the change and we have an opportunity to do so but we must look at our strategy to bring it about.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> Youth unemployment is at least 30% and 200,000 people have left our shores over the past two or three years. Emigration is not the answer and we all know its effect. We grew up seeing our friends and family members having to leave and we thought it was all behind us, but emigration has returned. We have an opportunity to bring about change, which is what people want to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The Taoiseach referred to the conflict in Syria. Today, I received messages about human rights lawyers in Bahrain and people being arrested. These people were not involved in violent conflict or advocating violence; they want to see peaceful resolution and change in their country. It is important we are on the side of change there. We should be on the side of those in Europe who want to build a free Europe, a federation of people who want freedom and independence for countries. We have the opportunity and I wish the Taoiseach well. We have the opportunity to bring home silverware and to build confidence in our people. People want to see it happen and I have no doubt that if the Taoiseach comes back with a separation of sovereign and banking debt, he will have the eternal gratitude of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">The IMF has admitted it underestimated the negative impact on growth of steep cuts in public spending. In Tokyo, the World Bank warned of cuts in growth across the developing world. Ms Lagarde said last week that eurozone countries should not blindly stick to tough budget deficit targets if growth weakens more than expected. She said they should allow automatic stabilisers, higher welfare spending and lower tax revenue to kick in if the economy deteriorates. The IMF is not saying that austerity is too hard, too unfair, causes too much pain in the short term or hits the poor more than the rich. It says that austerity may not achieve its goal of reducing debt within a reasonable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> The largest problem cases are Greece and Spain, which mirror many of the problems here. There is little doubt that austerity is devastating the Greek people. Workers, the unemployed, pensioners, small and medium-sized enterprises, women and young people are all suffering more than they should. The economy has contracted by 22% and workers and pensioners have lost 32% of their income. Unemployment is at 24% and youth unemployment is at 55%. Austerity policies have led to cuts in benefits, the deregulation of the labour market and further deterioration of the limited welfare state that had survived the neoliberal onslaught of the past 20 years. People with common sense are screaming that we need to prioritise the needs of workers, pensioners and the unemployed, not the interests of multinationals and bankrupt banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> For the likes of Greece, Spain and Ireland to continue to take on board the problems of the failed banks is too great a task. I hope the Government is successful in getting a deal from the Europeans so that the debt of banks is taken on by the European system.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">It does not belong to the Irish State or taxpayer. This must be made clear. The EU will eventually come around to that position. It will have to. Greece and Spain will not survive if they continue to take on so much of the debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The International Monetary Fund, IMF, is now saying Greece needs a reduction of €30 billion in its debt and the ECB and the EU must take the hit. The IMF is not exactly a radical body, yet these are the people who are saying Greece will not meet its targets. There was a notion that Greece would bring its debt down to 120% of GDP by 2020. It is now admitted that the figure will probably be 140% unless the problem of the debt Greece cannot pay is tackled. The same applies to Spain and will apply to us. </p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I was amused by the announcement that the EU had been awarded the Nobel peace prize. The timing of the prize is odd. In the last few years, the EU has changed from an institution that uses economic integration to promote peace to one that is sacrificing peace on the altar of free market economics. The handling of the eurozone crisis has transformed the EU into a source of conflict and sometimes violence on the streets. </p>
          <p eId="para_587"> We have seen some odd Nobel peace prize winners in the past. I remember Henry Kissinger being awarded the prize in a year when 50,000 people died in Vietnam. That was the first anomaly that caught my eye. A few years ago, shortly after President Obama was elected he said he would escalate the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He kept his word and was given the Nobel peace prize. </p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The EU is promoting unemployment and class division leading to violence on the streets. I see nothing very peaceful about that. The founder of the Nobel peace prize said its recipient had to support peace in every manner. One cannot say that of the EU at present. This is the same EU that supported the war in Iraq, and many of its member states had troops in Afghanistan. We supported Israel and backed it on almost every issue regarding Palestine and we have undermined the elected Government of Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> It was gas to listen to José Manuel Barroso praising the EU for its defence of human rights and saying it merited the peace prize. This is the man who, when he was Prime Minister of Portugal, defended the invasion of Iraq. How can someone who defended the invasion of Iraq against the wishes of his own people talk about human rights? I do not understand that. </p>

          <p eId="para_590">We were told the statement of the summit meeting of 29 June was a game changer. It created hope and an expectation that the statement would be followed through with action. Since then, countries such as Austria, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands have put a serious doubt over the statement of 20 June. Mario Draghi downplayed the idea of monetary financing which is what Ireland needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> When it was suggested that there might be an extension of the time to close our budget deficit the Tánaiste went on television and said people "wanted this over with". I agree that people want to see some hope. I use the word "hope" rather than "confidence" which is the terminology of the markets. In the absence of some degree of certainty it will be impossible to engender that hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I read the Taoiseach's statement but I could not see any follow through on the statement of 29 June. The Taoiseach must state clearly that the statement of 29 June has not given the certainty it was intended to give. It has not clarified the position regarding legacy debt and has opened up a dialogue that is really damaging. Will the Taoiseach seek a new statement or a clarification of the statement of 29 June? If that statement was the view of EU leaders, surely the forthcoming Council meeting should issue a clarification of what was intended. We urgently need that.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> We owe something like €51 billion over and above our GDP, and it is increasing. This is predominantly because of the socialisation of banking debt. People would have been prepared to put up with punishment if they had seen an end to the crisis, but they are not prepared to accept the current paralysis. It is affecting the national mood, discouraging people from starting businesses and driving emigration, which is not a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> At the forthcoming Council meeting, I ask the Taoiseach to raise the urgent need to clarify what was meant by the statement of 29 June. Does it include legacy debt? We could accept postponement of the solution until March 2013 if it was clear that we are working towards a solution by that date. There is, however, a serious doubt among most Irish people that what was said on 29 June actually meant that legacy debt would be dealt with. </p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The IMF statement on austerity is most serious. I will be astonished if it does not find its way onto the agenda for the Council meeting. If the IMF is indicating that austerity will further damage the prospect of recovery, serious attention needs to be paid to that view in terms of changing direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">I favour Giovanni Trapattoni's chances more than those of the failed strategy of the EU leadership, including the Government. We are listening to the same stuff as before. We are told we have turned a corner and the worst is over. We hear talk of bank deals and all the other points made by Deputes. This smacks of unreality. What is being dished up for the citizens of Europe is a continuing diet of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Respected Nobel prize winning economists, and not only radical socialists, have repeatedly said the problem is being misdiagnosed and the wrong solution prescribed. Austerity has never turned a situation around. It was tried in the 1920s, in Latin America and in Asia. It never worked. As Joseph Stiglitz said to International Bar Association conference in Dublin earlier this month, it has only succeeded in turning downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions. The eurozone is now heading for recession not only in the peripheral countries, but in the heartland, with the second successive drop in GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The IMF has admitted that it got it wrong and that its calculations were wrong. It is not surprising; we know that from the statistics. What is surprising is that the European leaders continue to go down that path. It is a toss up whether the charge should be gross incompetence or criminal negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The consequences of these actions can be seen most desperately among the population of Greece due to the shrinking of that country's economy and the desperate hardship. It is happening everywhere else across Europe as well. There is the madness of the massive €3 trillion being hoarded by private interests and not invested in job creation, while 25 million people are unemployed. That is the contradiction at the heart of the EU and I do not foresee any way forward being pointed out at this meeting. The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of emerging differences between many of the leaders rather than addressing the problems in Greece and Spain. The Germans are pushing for more fiscal discipline and further surrender of economic autonomy. What will be the Taoiseach's response to that?</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> It is clear now that it is not a case of if the Greeks will exit from the euro but when they do. What will the contagion effect be in countries such as Spain or Italy? There are divisions even in the heartland of Germany. The predominant interests want to keep the eurozone together. If the Germans exited the eurozone, they would have serious problems. They would face having a strong deutschmark and being disadvantaged competitively when selling into the shrinking market of a crisis-ridden eurozone. It is not in their interests to do that. There is a contradiction, however, because the summit is tinkering around the edges, looking at issues such as the banking situation and the ECB increasing its supervisory role and so forth, while it is demanding commitments and contracts on an annual basis relating to structural reforms in the labour market and so forth. I cannot see any way out of this unless the banking debt is dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> There is probably a more important meeting taking place in Europe tomorrow, a meeting of the European Trade Union Council. It represents 60 million workers across Europe and will meet in Spain tomorrow. It is putting forward the idea of an international movement of ordinary people throughout Europe and putting the interests of workers and ordinary people and public investment in jobs and job creation before bailing out failed banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">I welcome the contributions of the Deputies to this debate. It is important the House has an opportunity before European Union summit meetings to discuss the issues that will arise and to have its input. It struck me, however, that some of the contributors appeared to be speaking as if the 29 June meeting never happened and the conclusions were never made.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I will travel to Brussels on Thursday morning to represent Ireland as the incoming holder of the Presidency of the European Union at the tripartite social summit. This forum meets twice a year ahead of the spring and autumn European Councils. It is an important opportunity for an exchange of views between the social partners, the European Commission and the current and subsequent holders of the Council Presidency. The discussions on Thursday will focus on promoting growth, jobs and social inclusion, with a particular emphasis on the involvement of the social partners. I look forward to having a constructive dialogue with the EU social partners on the EU's growth and employment priorities. These issues will be at the heart of discussions at the European Council meeting. They are subjects that are of the greatest importance to our citizens and they will be at the heart of our Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Having agreed the compact for growth and jobs in June, the Heads of State and Government will now return to it to review progress on its implementation. The compact represents an important achievement from the June Council meeting. Ireland had consistently made the point that as well as necessary structural reforms and consolidation, member states and the EU must have a clear focus on the creation of sustainable jobs and growth. It is through growth not just here at home, but also in our main trading partners and markets, that we will be able to get our people back to work and our economy back on a sustainable footing. The compact provides a clear framework for actions at national, EU and euro area levels, and it is important the European Council would take stock and set additional orientations, as necessary, with a view to ensuring it promotes growth and employment. However, the compact will mean little to people across Europe if it does not contribute to employment and jobs, especially among young people. We must strengthen the European Council follow-up on this point and we will continue to do that in Brussels this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The other main element under the economic policy that this meeting of the European Council will address is President Van Rompuy's interim report on strengthening economic and monetary union. As the Taoiseach said, if the European Union is to remain credible, the commitments that were made at the end of June must be honoured in full. The Commission has brought forward a proposal for a single supervisory mechanism. It is important that work on that be advanced as a matter of urgency. The June meeting made a very clear decision to separate bank and sovereign debt. What must happen now is to see that decision implemented in practice. That is being worked upon and is part of the discussions this Government is having with the ECB and our partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> If I may borrow the football analogy mentioned earlier, there is a fundamental difference between Giovanni Trapattoni's record and this Government's record in Europe. Trapattoni returned from Europe without a win or a single point, while this Government has won all its games in Europe, including the reduction in the interest rate and the decision to separate bank and sovereign debt. I have every confidence we will deliver the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer in respect of the bank debt deal. It is not a question of when it will be done, but of the substance of the agreement we will secure.</p>

            <p eId="para_609">I thank the Minister of State for being present to reply on this matter. Over recent months the Minister and his officials have kept the Dáil and the relevant Oireachtas committee well informed regarding the work the Department is doing to tackle the issue of what will happen to communities whose homes have been flooded regularly, most recently in October and November last year. The updates have centred on two areas. The first is the physical work that has been done by both the Department and the local authorities on preventative measures to ensure either that the areas will not flood or the risk of them being flooded is massively reduced. The other area is one on which the Minister has been working, the discussions taking place between the Department and the insurance industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> I will outline the situation in which many of my constituents find themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">They are resident in areas that have been flooded but where the council has carried out flood repairs. The insurance companies, however, still will not insure them. Many of them now find themselves being hit by a triple whammy. The first is that they have been flooded regularly in the past, and the fear of it happening again in future remains. Often it is more than a fear; it is a possibility. The second is that many of them now, because of the point when they bought their houses and what has since happened, have seen the values of their homes being massively affected. The third problem is that they cannot get house insurance. They love their homes and are proud of their communities but the values of their properties have fallen dramatically. They cannot get house insurance and if any of them wanted to sell, which most do not, they would not be able to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> Dublin City Council is working on many of the flood prevention measures so what options are open to people in areas where work has been done or is planned but insurers refuse to provide insurance? In such a situation we should be able to perform some sort of role to ensure these people are given the protection they deserve. It is not their fault they are being flooded. It is a result of action that was taken elsewhere.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Brian Hayes)<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_613">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. I am well aware of the impact that flooding has on businesses and householders. Having visited affected areas this summer, I am aware of the hardship and loss suffered as a result of flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> Most people are reliant on their insurance policies to protect them against the worst of the financial cost and loss arising. In this regard, I remain aware of the difficulties some people have been experiencing in securing insurance cover for flood risk at affordable prices or at all. Insurance companies make their own assessment of risk in any particular case. However, in areas where flood defence and alleviation works have been carried out, I cannot accept that any property protected by significant public capital investment would not be able to receive a quotation for insurance at reasonable cost. I have been engaged on this issue for some time now and I have made it clear recently that I am somewhat frustrated with the rate at which progress is being made in coming to an agreement with the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, and the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> I first met with the industry in March 2012 and I had a very constructive engagement with it about the scope and scale of the work undertaken by the OPW on flood risk management, on the alleviation schemes being undertaken in many of our large cities and towns and, in particular, on the mapping of areas subject to flood risk nationally which will emerge from the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management programme. I indicated then that I wished to see an agreement reached as quickly as possible between the OPW and the IIF on a sustainable system of information sharing particularly for locations vulnerable to flooding and for identifying flood alleviation schemes and works completed and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.</p>
            <p eId="para_616"> While this may seem to be a straightforward matter, there are complex technical issues involved concerning the design standards and risk levels of defence works and the impact of those works in reducing the risk of flooding. Officials in the OPW have been working on developing a system for presenting information on flood defence schemes to the insurance industry to meet the technical requirements set out by the industry for risk assessment purposes. On 5 July 2012, the OPW made a presentation to the IIF and a number of the main insurance companies on a proposed template for providing the required information. The essential focus and objective of OPW's work has been in putting flood defence information on a GIS platform. This means the information will be accessible and viewable in a mapping environment and via the Internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> The demonstration of the system at the meeting on 5 July showed examples of flood protected areas of Clonmel and Ennis. The areas identified are protected by flood relief schemes carried out by the OPW or local authorities. These areas are generally protected against a flood that has a probability of occurring of 1% in any one year. The maps will be presented on a web viewer with a link to details of the scheme design, including a design report, environmental impact study, if one was carried out, and scheme drawings.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> Following the presentation on 5 July, the OPW wrote to the IIF on 19 July providing it with detailed information in template form on the schemes mentioned and requesting that it disseminate this information to its member companies with a view to getting feedback and comment on the proposed template. I understand the IIF has indicated in recent days that it is in the process of collating the responses it has received from its members on the OPW information and it hopes to be in a position shortly to formally respond on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> I look forward to receiving the IIF response and I very much hope that it will be positive and allow for speedy agreement on the format of the information to be provided by the OPW. There may be some technical details to be ironed out but I would hope that these can be resolved quickly. With the agreement of the IIF, the OPW will then be in a position to progress with its work on compiling the information on other flood defence schemes that have been completed. This will take some time as there is a lot of detail to be sorted through. The focus initially will be on compiling information on the main schemes that have been carried out since 1995 when the current programme of major flood works began.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> I acknowledge the insurance industry's engagement on this important matter. There is no question but that the industry has suffered substantial losses from major flood events in recent years. In its presentation to the joint committee, the IIF indicated that the cumulative cost of the eight major flood events since the year 2000 has been €697 million. Against that, however, must be balanced the very significant investment made by the State in major urban flood defence schemes since 1995 and the huge benefit deriving from that investment in terms of properties protected and losses avoided. It is estimated that almost 8,000 properties have been protected to date and the value of the benefit deriving from that is of the order of €800 million. The State, therefore, is certainly doing its part to mitigate the impact of flooding and I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Government and I will continue to do so in so far as resources allow.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive response. Many of the communities I represent such as Cabra, East Wall, North Wall, Clonliffe Road and Ballybough, despite the works that have taken place or that are promised, cannot get insurance for their homes. Any day there is rain like there was on Sunday, the first people I think of are those who live in homes that are not protected from flood risks who then face the nightmare of not having any support if they are flooded. The Minister of State made a key point: it is not just that they cannot get insurance, it is that they cannot get it at any price. I urge the Minister of State to do everything in his power to bring those discussions to a close so residents in areas at risk will see a framework being put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">I thank the Deputy for his constructive comments in this debate. For an agreement to be reached, two parties much come together. The State wants that agreement because it is in the interests of the State to establish a written protocol with the insurance industry on the standard of work we have put in place, which is to a minimum of a 100 year event, meaning the works on flood defences will withstand even such an event. We will stand over the work we do; it requires other third parties in the private sector to accept what we are saying. The Deputy will appreciate the frustration I feel in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> The first task is to agree a template of information that at least we are all agreeing with the information being provided, in other words, what we have done since 1995 in terms of major flood alleviation works in urban centres is guaranteed to withstand a 100 year event should such an event occur. Once we have an agreement in that regard and once they accept that I would hope, at the minimum, the insurance companies would provide cover to those areas where major urban capital infrastructure investment has gone in for those flood mitigating projects. I cannot demand with a gun that they do that; I cannot demand that they form an agreement with that because these are private sector companies which argue to me that they have seen substantial losses as a result of the flooding events in recent years but we will continue to work at it.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> I use the opportunity provided by this debate to tell the insurance companies that I am frustrated at the lack of progress and that if we have not come to an agreement with them concerning the template of information, we can at least share at a platform level between the federation and ourselves. I want to bring these matters to a conclusion as soon as possible and if people are not prepared to agree, they should say so but to continue at a distance while people cannot get cover is an appalling situation. I fully appreciate and sympathise with the situation the Deputy and his constituents face as it is replicated in many parts of the country. It is one thing not to have insurance cover when one is waiting for works to be done, but it is another to say that there should be no insurance cover where substantial investment has been made by the State. I continue to work with the Irish Insurance Federation and the companies affected to bring them to the table and negotiate a fair settlement on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue which is of considerable importance not only to two families in my constituency, but to young adults in general who may have a disability. It concerns the need for the Department of Education and Skills to show flexibility in the use of transportation for young adults from Cavan who are attending Midway Services in County Meath, bearing in mind paragraph 4.13 on page 66 of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland which states: "Service providers should examine the possibility of sharing transport resources on a cost neutral basis with other local service providers/community groups taking into account the recent announcement of plans for the Department of Transport to integrate local transport services."</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> Recently I was contacted by two families in Cavan, both of whom have an 18 year old daughter with an intellectual disability. Both recently turned 18 years of age, graduated from St. Ultan's secondary school in Navan and are attending Midway Services, also in Navan, County Meath. While attending St. Ultan's secondary school, both availed of transport on a Bus Éireann school bus from their homes to school. The Department of Education and Skills has deemed both ineligible to avail of the service as they are 18 years of age and deemed to be adults and no longer in mainstream education. </p>
            <p eId="para_627"> It is the intention of the two families that the two young women will use public transportation on their own in the short term but the parents and support workers at Midway Services agree it will be some time before they will be able to travel unaccompanied. This proposal is a temporary solution only. In the interim, the hope is that both could continue to travel to Midway Services on the Bus Éireann school bus. Both of them used this bus service previously when they attended St. Ultan's secondary school until May 2012 before turning 18. </p>
            <p eId="para_628"> The bus travels past their houses every day with empty seats. I understand there may be some concerns around child protection given that they are 18 years of age. As the bus driver is an adult and there is an adult escort on the bus, the two young women are not deemed by professionals to be threatening to children, quite the contrary. As they know the children on the bus, having previously travelled on it, and are from the community, this makes no sense and is grossly insulting. It was a practice in the past to do this. On one previous occasion in my constituency a young woman in a similar situation was allowed to avail of the school transport scheme from her home to an adult day service in County Meath. As a goodwill gesture, the Department and the Health Service Executive allowed this to take place. The sharing of services took place in the good days in the times of plenty, but in times of economic restriction and constraint it is proposed to do the opposite and to pile up the costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_629"> The parents of one of those two young women have other young children, are both working out of economic necessity and are not in a position to drive the children. The parents of the other young woman are elderly. The mother is awaiting hospitalisation for serious issues and they are not in a position to take the children to Midway Services. It defies logic that a bus travels past their houses which they would have used a few months ago, that the seats are available and that it is only proposed to allow them travel as a interim solution. It defies all natural justice and is discriminatory, wrong and bizarre.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> School transport is a very significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on the Department's behalf and covering over 82 million kilometres annually. Approximately 114,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in the last school year on a daily basis to schools throughout the country. This network involves approximately 4,000 vehicles covering over 82 million kilometres annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> A primary objective of the school transport scheme is to support the transport to and from school of children who would have difficulty travelling for reasons of distance to their nearest school if transport is not supported and to date this has been the sole focus of that scheme. While I recognise the need for flexibility in the use of transportation, this is a complex matter and a number of critical factors must be borne in mind. In the first instance, school transport vehicles are routed and timetabled to coincide with school opening and closing times and existing contract arrangements with private sector providers are framed along these lines. In this context, it is significant that some 85% of school transport provision is now provided by private sector operators on foot of contracts with Bus Éireann. Bus Éireann is operating a process of rolling out five year contracts to maximise value for money and security of provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_633"> A further significant factor to be considered in the integration of school transport services is child protection. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the opening up of school transport services to adults would have serious risks if it were to be contemplated. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I are together looking closely at the issue of integrated rural transport provision and in that context the National Transport Authority has assumed a role in this area. I understand that proposals are being developed by a working group involving representatives of my Department and the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government, Bus Éireann, the Health Service Executive and others. I consider this is the most appropriate way of advancing this agenda and dealing with the type of issues I have outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate he is working on the local brief he received. I appeal to him to revisit a couple of issues. The issue of timing does not arise because the professional personnel at Midway Services, where the young adults who have an intellectual disability attend, will collect them from the bus. The local bus driver and helpers have no issue. Therefore, that is a non issue. I appreciate the Minister received the briefing and did not write it. The young adults in question are very benign people who have a good profile and the professionals who work with them are convinced that, contrary to being a threat to children, they are great friends of the local children and travelled previously with them until they reached the age of 18 years. Only a couple of months ago they travelled on the same bus with the same young people from their community and now they are barred from travelling on the bus.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">While I appreciate the Minister of State's response, I appeal that common sense, natural justice, Christianity and ordinary human values should apply here. The Minister of State should revisit the brief, go to the people who wrote the script and say, "Sad, but we are about people and this is reality".</p>

We have established a working group between my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the HSE to investigate how we can best use our scarce resources for transport in all rural areas. This would encompass school transport, rural transport and patient transport. Although we are early in that process, significant possible savings have been identified as well as a possible enhancement of the service available to people in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> The Deputy is suggesting an interim, piecemeal and ad hoc change to our school transport system, which would not be the wisest approach. We need to consider the matter in an integrated fashion. If we are to amend the school transport and rural transport systems, it needs to be done in a careful and considered manner given that it is a very complex operation, transporting 114,000 children to and from school each day. The Deputy's concerns and suggestions to amalgamate transport for people in rural areas will be considered as we continue along the process of hopefully providing school transport and rural transport systems that best serve the needs of people in rural areas.</p>

It would include school transport for the young people to whom the Deputy has referred. Distinct possibilities are opening up in the areas he suggests, but it needs to be done in a considered and careful way across the school transport system, rather than on an ad hoc basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_640">I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter this evening. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for coming to the Chamber personally to respond. I could commend the Minister of State on the many actions she has taken on since she acquired this brief, but as I have only four minutes I will deal with the matter at hand, which is the consideration, if any, that has been given to instituting a rent-to-buy scheme for NAMA residential properties for first-time buyers and prospective owner-occupiers.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> The Government has two clearly identifiable tasks related to home ownership and both relate to normalising the residential property market. First, we need to deal with people who have bought homes and find themselves in financial distress. We have seen actions arising from the Keane report, the most significant of which is the Personal Insolvency Bill, at present before the House. However, we also need to look to the present and the future and create a normalised residential property market, which does not favour investment over the purchase of a home, as we witnessed in the bubble years. Despite the difficulties in the residential property market in recent years, we will continue to be a home-buying nation. In future people will continue to have the ambition to live in a home they own.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> At present, NAMA has 14,000 residential properties in the State, 9,000 of which are being rented. I propose the introduction of a rent-to-buy programme to deal with these NAMA properties. A structured plan and scheme should be examined in conjunction with NAMA to make that happen. People interested in purchasing a home have two concerns. First, they are concerned over whether house prices will continue to drop and, second, they are concerned about the security of their jobs and incomes. The Government has taken action on the house prices, with the implementation of the residential property price register database a number of weeks ago, which gives clarity and a degree of certainty to that issue. Obviously that needs adjustment to give more clarity as to the property type - whether it is a flat, a house or an apartment, the number of bedrooms and the floor area - because at the moment it just gives an address.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> There is also the issue of salary security, and the option of a rent-to-buy programme would allow people, who are paying rent which is the equivalent of a mortgage, to do so over a period of two to three years and the rent, accruing over a period of time, would act as a deposit, which would also deal with the issue of loan to value. Since 2009 the Central Bank has correctly tightened up on the lending practices of the past. It also needs to tighten up on loan-to-value requirements, along with the required income levels for those who are purchasing. Over a two to three year period, people in a position to pay market rents in a rent-to-buy programme should be able to achieve loan-to-value percentages of 90% to 95%. </p>
            <p eId="para_644"> NAMA would be also beneficiaries of such a proposal. NAMA has estates throughout the country, some of which are category 3 ghost estates which means they require a minimum amount of adjustment to take them out of the ghost estate ranking. However, they require maintenance and security. By putting into those estates residents, who had the intention of purchasing those homes over a number of years, we would establish communities, the dereliction of these sites would be halted and the existing cost of security on these sites could be used to get them corrected. We would succeed in normalising the housing market by putting in place a robust rent-to-by programme with proper lending practices. It would deal with a housing crisis that will arise in a few years with a young population and an ongoing demand for property purchase into the future that will need to be met. Why not meet that demand now with the 14,000 NAMA properties, 9,000 of which are being rented. Surely we should try to get those rented properties purchased.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O'Sullivan)<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_645">I thank the Deputy for making this suggestion. I need to give my reply in the context of the Government's 2011 housing policy statement, which is quite explicit in taking a tenure-neutral approach to housing. That is, we will work towards enabling households to access the type of housing that best suits their needs at a point in time. Part of the function of the National Asset Management Agency, as a major holder of residential property stock, is to make a contribution to the social and economic development of the State. In this regard, the delivery of a social dividend from its stock of residential properties is a key challenge that Government has set the agency. While progress in this regard has not been as fast as hoped for, it has identified 2,000 units that may match well with my Department's social housing leasing initiative that is being rolled out in conjunction with the approved housing body sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> The residential mortgage initiative product launched by NAMA this year may have a role in facilitating people who want and can afford to buy to realise their home ownership aspirations. However, there is a fine line between facilitating and enticing. I have no issue with facilitating, but we need to be careful with enticing because we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the recent past.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> While I have no function in respect of the commercial activities of the agency, a responsibility which rests with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, I believe a rent-to-buy scheme could have merit. I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue in the context of the provision of housing that meets individual needs at a point in time. Such a scheme could provide a housing solution to households, with the possibility, but not the legal obligation, of progressing to purchase at a point in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> The Deputy may be aware that in 2010 my Department launched a rent-to-buy scheme in the Dublin City Council area specifically to facilitate Dublin City Council to deploy unsold affordable housing units in its stock. Under this scheme, the applicant will rent the property for up to three years, with an option to purchase at any time during this term at an agreed affordable purchase price. A percentage of the rent paid can be used as a deposit towards the purchase of the property. At the end of this three-year period, the applicant has the choice of proceeding or not with the purchase. While the fact that this scheme provides an opportunity for eligible households to test drive home-ownership for a few years without the fear of getting caught out by fluctuations in the housing market is not its main aim, there are still some very real advantages in it for individual households.</p>
            <p eId="para_649"> Taking this into account, I will raise the topic under discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as another potential housing market intervention by NAMA. <i>
							</i>I compliment Deputy Lynch, who always thinks outside the box, on coming up with this practical proposal. As I stated, I will take it to the Minister for Finance, who is the relevant Minister dealing with NAMA in this regard.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_392">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_650">I thank the Minister of State for her explicit response. Often, what we get are scripted responses to Topical Issues. It is obvious this evening that the Minister of State has given her attention to the issue I have raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> The Minister of State referred to the 80:20 scheme introduced by NAMA, which is a welcome development that allows people to purchase a home at 80% of its value and which provides that where a property loses 20% of its value, the purchaser will realise it over a period of his or her mortgage. The Minister of State also set out the Department's policy in terms of it remaining neutral on this issue and in regard to the concept of enticing people into making purchases when it might not be suitable for them. While I concur with the Minister of State's sentiments on this, the fact remains that Ireland will remain a home purchasing nation for those who can afford to do so and therein lies the nub of the issue, namely, what is determined as affordability. In my view, house prices have almost reached the point of normalisation, namely, that they now cost three to four times the rate of annual income. The average price of a house countrywide is currently three to four times the annual national industrial wage. </p>
            <p eId="para_652"> Another issue that arises is that of social dividend and NAMA's responsibility in this regard. I am aware that the Department has delivered housing options for homeless agencies and through the 80:20 scheme. However, in terms of dealing with enticement of concerns, we are now presented with a unique opportunity in terms of the lending model applied in the rent-to-buy scheme being robustly structured to reflect the lending criteria set out in 2009 by the Central Bank, which acknowledged the mistakes of the past when people were permitted to include overtime pay, secondary rental income and so on into the equation when applying for mortgages, resulting in purchasing prices in some parts of the country increasing from two to three times a person's income to ten to 12 times his or her income. </p>
            <p eId="para_653"> I note the Minister of State's undertaking to take up this matter with the Minister, Deputy Hogan. Members of this House are experiencing difficulty engaging with NAMA owing to how the NAMA legislation is drafted. On one occasion I had to obtain senior counsel advice because of the manner in which NAMA is structured. I believe some engagement should take place with NAMA at departmental level, be it the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Finance, in regard to the stock which it has in hand, some of which may not be saleable or may be in remote locations. There are NAMA estates on the periphery of Cork city which, if normalisation of the market occurred, could become attractive to purchasers. The scheme I am promoting this evening is for first-time buyers and owner-occupiers rather than investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> I ask that the Minister of State request NAMA to examine what stock it has in hand which, in terms of location and affordability, would be attractive to purchasers on a 20 to 25 year term rather than the 30 to 35 year term witnessed in the past and to ensure that the mortgage product put in place and structure of same would be such that it would be sustainable and would, in the context of prospective purchases, be reflective of the rent they are currently paying in these properties.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, my main objective is to provide options for people in the context of fairness and choice using the various vehicles at our disposal. NAMA is a player in this regard. The Deputy referred to the 80:20 scheme. We also engage with people through the social housing scheme. A social dividend has been written into the NAMA legislation. NAMA also has a commercial mandate. However, I believe its commercial mandate and social dividend can tie in with each other, resulting in a win-win situation in terms of the role given to NAMA under the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The Deputy's suggestions should and will be brought to the attention of NAMA. In terms of policy, the relevant Minister is the Minister for Finance. I will also bring the Deputy's suggestion to his attention. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, and I also meet with NAMA in regard to the transfer of social houses. NAMA has decided to establish a special purpose vehicle in order to speed up that process. The Deputy's suggestion is worthy of consideration. What we all want to achieve is as many options as possible for people who need a home. There is much merit in the Deputy's proposal, for which I thank him.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_657">Last Saturday, I walked with more than 1,000 citizens in Donaghmede, Dublin 13, which is in my constituency, to mark the first anniversary of the traumatic evacuation of Priory Hall residents from their homes in October 2011 owing to the profound fire safety and other defects discovered in that complex. I again pay tribute to the Priory Hall residents and their families for their ongoing, outstanding and dignified campaign for justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> On Saturday, we heard powerful testimonies from some of the resident leaders, including Graham Usher, Stephanie Meehan, Sínead Power and Darren Kelly, in regard to the horrific ongoing suffering of the Priory Hall families. For example, Stephanie detailed the awful impact on her two young children of being evacuated from their home, spending Christmas 2011 as refugees in their own country. Incredibly, Priory Hall families are now facing a second Christmas out of their homes, with the future as uncertain as ever.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> No remediation work has been carried out since last November, even though at the time of the evacuation residents were told that they would be back in their homes in about five weeks. I also spoke last Saturday to some of the parents and grandparents of Priory Hall residents who never imagined their children and grandchildren being treated so badly. As pointed out yesterday by Graham Usher in a letter to <i>The Irish Times, </i>residents have faced a 12 month battle with the developer Tom McFeely, Dublin City Council, the Government and the banks. Graham rightly calls Priory Hall "a failure of the State". I note that Mr. McFeely was in court again today in relation to breaches of court orders and the non-disclosure of assets. </p>
            <p eId="para_660"> The key question is when will the resolution process be concluded? That was the question on everyone's lips at the public demonstration last Saturday. The threat of Dublin City Council's Supreme Court case on the withdrawal of families' accommodation still looms. Residents also point out that if they currently have a moratorium on their mortgage, the capital interest on it is accelerating all the time. This could be horrifically compounded if residents are left in negative equity, with a huge mortgage on an unsafe and unsaleable home. It was also reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday that Dublin City Council has spent €2 million on the Priory Hall debacle, including a reported €700,000 on security. One year on, residents are in a worse position than ever. When will we know the result of the resolution process and when will it be possible for the families with Priory Hall to move on with their lives?</p>

            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_661">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue for discussion. We never thought that a year on we would be making the same case for these people who have been to hell in relation to this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> It appears that over the past 12 months the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, has passed the buck on Priory Hall and these people remain abandoned as far as we can ascertain. As Deputy Broughan stated, we reiterate the fact we want the Minister to meet the residents to discuss funding mechanisms for the remedial works and help find a permanent solution to the current plight of the 260 residents, many of whom are paying hefty mortgages on uninhabitable homes. Without doubt, this must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> The Minister stated he has not met the residents because of ongoing legal proceedings, that he must respect the independence of the designated authority, Dublin City Council, and that he cannot interfere in individual cases. Based on the failure of all parties and those in officialdom to address this issue, the time has long since passed to bring about a resolution. The conciliation process must be brought to a conclusion. If this means interference by the Minister with responsibility in this regard, then let this be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> On a related issue, on the day when local government reform has been published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, we have not seen the appointment of a planning regulator, as was Judge Mahon's wish. In recent years we have not seen proper funding put in place to augment, help and support enforcement officers in local authorities whose role could be that bit more real were they to have the resources to pursue planning, development, health and safety and building control regulations, which is their remit. I plead with the Minister to reconsider the appointment of a planning regulator to enforce proper procedures and guidelines on planning throughout the local government sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_665">I am shocked the Minister is hiding behind a legal process. The conciliation process is not good enough. A year is a long time for people to live in a nightmare. Regardless of whether the Minister accepts it, the State bears a huge responsibility in the matter. To say regulations are not good enough does not cut a lot of ice. The regulations in Ireland are decent and it is the lack of enforcement which is the problem. If the current arrangements had been adhered to in a proper manner, Priory Hall would not have happened. Local authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and, where necessary, undertake enforcement action to ensure compliance. Local authorities did not have the resources to do so, and this is a Government issue. The Government must take responsibility but even if it grabbed the bull by the horns and dealt with it, many people are responsible. There is the builder, the engineer, the consultant engineer, the architect, the mechanical and electrical contractors and specialist subcontractors. All of these people had insurance. Perhaps one cannot get any money from the builder at this stage, but other people have a responsibility and the issue needs to be co-ordinated by the Government. The issue must be tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> The fact that there was no enforcement of the regulations by the local authority is the crucial issue. There is no point in looking at a building when the curtains are hanging. One does not know what has happened because it is all covered up at that stage and it is too late. We do not need to change the regulations - we need to change the way the rules are enforced. If a consultant engineer and architect are to take responsibility for work carried out in their name, it must be supervised by somebody working for them. If this costs money then they should charge it to the builder. The current arrangement is nonsense and the Government must act on it and change it. The regulations are fine, but the lack of enforcement is a killer and is what is causing the problem. The Government bears a huge responsibility for what happened at Priory Hall and the Minister has not taken responsibility for it. He is too keen to kick it down the road and state there is a legal process. A year later it is a nightmare for the people involved and it is not good enough. The Government would interfere in other issues where it suits them. It needs to interfere in this.</p>

            <p eId="para_667">Like the other Deputies, I believe Priory Hall has become a symbol of what is best and worst in Irish society. We have a community of young families and parents banding together in solidarity to try to secure basic human rights in Ireland in 2012, but we also have a society which is effectively ignoring them, from the Government to the local authority to the banks and other agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> Like Deputy Broughan, I was there on Saturday and the deterioration in the structure since we were there a number of months ago is substantial. There is no going back. These people will not end up back in the community and nor should they be expected to return there. The only solution is to take it down and allow these people to rebuild their lives. It is an indictment of the banks, many of them publicly owned, that these people, who are evacuees from their homes living in inadequate accommodation which they cannot call their own, continue to pay mortgages for their property which is a health hazard. Some people have secured a moratorium but the interest is increasing. We as taxpayers, a Government and a Parliament who own these banks must step in. The mortgages should be transferred to a property of the choosing of the residents, be it in NAMA or somewhere else. Priory Hall is no more and these people will not return there.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> I agree with the other Deputies that it is unacceptable that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, hid behind a court case between Mr. McFeely and Dublin City Council. It had nothing to do with the residents so he could have met them. After this he hid behind the conciliation process. This is not good enough. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, should meet the residents because the State is complicit. Successive Governments stood over self-certification and inadequate regulation and, crucially, inadequate enforcement. There will be no solution unless the Government takes ownership of this. In fairness, on Saturday residents were extremely critical of the role of the Government and the political establishment. To my mind they are correct. We need to take action. One year is far too long. This has become a symbol of other developments and it should not be happening here or anywhere else.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_670">I will reply to these issues on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. I acknowledge the very difficult and distressing situation faced by the residents of Priory Hall who have been out of their homes for 12 months. I share the wishes of all concerned, and those who raised the issue in the Chamber, to see the matter resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> A Supreme Court hearing on an appeal by Dublin City Council against an order to pay for accommodation, storage costs and ancillary costs of residents forced to vacate their apartments at Priory Hall had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday, 24 April 2012. However, on Friday, 20 April 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to adjourn these proceedings to allow for a conciliation process between the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> The conciliation process is being chaired by Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court and a former President of the High Court. I understand the resolution process, which seeks to identify a way forward to the complex problems at Priory Hall, remains ongoing between the relevant parties. I am not a party to the legal proceedings and I have no role or involvement in the conciliation process. Out of respect for the process approved by the Supreme Court, and for Mr. Justice Finnegan, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further. It is important that all concerned afford Mr. Justice Finnegan the opportunity to complete the task which he has been given. I cannot tell the House how long this process will take, and I ask Deputies to respect the process being undertaken by Mr. Justice Finnegan.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> In his contribution, Deputy Broughan raised the pyrite issue, which I will also address. The pyrite report provides a comprehensive framework to move forward and provide effective solutions for home owners. The Minister's objective in setting up the pyrite panel was to assist home owners find a resolution to the pyrite problem, and his focus is now to ensure the recommendations are implemented in a way that delivers workable and practicable solutions for home owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">Following receipt of the report of the independent pyrite panel in late June, the Minister met with the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, the Irish Insurance Federation, HomeBond and the Irish Banking Federation in July and outlined to them the pivotal role he believes they can play in providing a solution to the pyrite problem. All parties have now submitted their responses to the Minister's request for proposals for a voluntary industry-led solution for homeowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> The Minister has made it abundantly clear on a number of occasions that in the absence of workable solutions from the stakeholders, he will consider an imposed solution along the lines recommended in the pyrite report. Recommendation 14 in the report recommends the establishment of a resolution board which could be funded by the construction, quarrying and related insurance sectors. The responses from the stakeholders are now being evaluated and together with the relevant recommendations in the pyrite report, will inform the development of proposals which will provide for a solution to the pyrite problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> The report of the pyrite panel contains 24 recommendations and work is also progressing on the implementation of a number of other recommendations in the report. Recommendations in respect of the development of a mandatory certification system for buildings and a registration process for builders are currently being dealt with by the Department under the building control reform programme that the Minister announced last year. The Minister hopes to have revised building control regulations signed into law shortly. He has asked the National Standards Authority of Ireland to develop a testing and categorisation protocol for reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material and a method statement to provide guidance for the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings and this work has already commenced. So work is being done for the future but, unfortunately, Priory Hall and other issues that have been raised arose out of the way building was carried out in the past and we must make sure that never happens again. Unfortunately, I am not at liberty to comment on what Justice Finnegan is doing and I do not have a timeframe in respect of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">It is disappointing that the Minister of State does not have a timeframe and there is no framework. When this Dáil asks tribunals and other bodies to report, we usually give them a timeframe or ask for an interim report. People feel desolate at this stage. It is very hard to get across the sense of desolation people feel about being homeless. It is almost like something that would have happened after a war or in 1969 in parts of Northern Ireland. We really must try to get a result for them as soon as possible. One of the outstanding problems of this situation has been that the Minister has never met the people concerned and has refused to do so. Can we take it that even when we do have a resolution process decision, he will meet them? As Deputy Daly noted, the condition of the buildings is deteriorating day by day.</p>

Will the Minister of State be coming forward with major legislation and a social housing programme for 2013?</p>

            <p eId="para_683">I do not want to repeat the questions that have been asked by Deputy Broughan but I expect answers from the Minister in respect of the specific questions, namely, whether he will meet with the residents and show the sort of interest that should emanate from Government on this issue. Will the Minister of State respond to my query about the omission in today's announcement of local government reform of the appointment of a planning regulator, as was the wish of the Mahon tribunal? Has she any comment to make about the planning enforcement officers of local authorities throughout the country who cannot carry out the duties they were appointed to do by virtue of the lack of available funding through whatever guise, be it central Government funds or because their ability to raise funds themselves is not what it was some years ago? That being the case, how does she expect to address that issue? I am conscious that local authorities have been penalised in the third and fourth quarter in respect of central Government funds because of their inability to collect the household charge at the rate desired by the Government despite the fact the Government did not give them the tools to do that. Alternatively, had they been given advance notice, they might have done a better job than has been a case.</p>

            <p eId="para_685">About nine months ago, I visited the building and looked over it. I brought a hammer and had a look at how things were done. To be honest, I was completely shocked. I could not believe that so many different sections could allow what happened to take place. I believe it cannot be made right and it is not possible to bring that development to the stage it should be at for the people who paid for it. Those buildings must be knocked down and rebuilt. People should remember that the banks sent people out there to check whether it was safe to part with the mortgage money they were providing and the development was certified. The banks received certification from that person who, more often than not, was somebody within the banking structure. They stood over what was out there. Do not ask me how they did this but, as a builder, I would not like the job of rebuilding it. I would like to build it from scratch, not repair it.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">The response from the Minister of State was disappointing. I am not being in any way disrespectful towards the judge involved in the process but that is not really the issue. Certainly, residents are not happy that the Government would hide behind this process and delay meeting them. There is no excuse and there is no contradiction preventing the Minister from meeting the residents because that process is underway. The reference to pyrite is a bit like hiding behind the non-answer that is there. This development, which probably cannot be repaired, is a health and safety deathtrap. One of the residents made the point on Saturday that Tom McFeely, rogue and all that he is, developed good buildings in Great Britain. He did so because he knew the British state would chase him and ensure that regulations were enforced. This State did not do so. We are culpable, the Minister is our representative and must meet these people and the State has to take a lead in dealing with this situation. The development should be knocked down, the banks which are our banks should be made pay a price in respect of that and the mortgages should be transferred to other properties to allow these people to move on with their lives. If we are here in another six months on this, it will be an absolute indictment of the Minister and Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">I will convey to the Minister the views expressed. The Government is not hiding behind anything but the fact is the judge has been appointed to do a job by the court and has specifically indicated that he wants to be given time to do that job. So we must be careful about what we say and allow him to do the job he has been given. I will certainly convey the views expressed and I believe, like other Members of the House, that the priority is to get people back into their homes if they are habitable as soon as possible and to ensure that those residents are the most important people in all of this. We in no way stand over what was done in the past. Terrible things were done in the construction industry in the past and we are trying to clean up that mess, which is why we are bringing forward new regulations and new ways of doing things.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The point made by Deputy Cowen about the planning regulator and today's announcement is not really relevant to this debate but I will comment on it. We have made it quite clear that we will implement the recommendations of the Mahon report, including the recommendation with regard to a planning regulator. I wrote to Deputy Ciarán Lynch when he was chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, asking that we have a discussion with the committee about what it sees as the best way to implement that recommendation. It could be by way of An Bord Pleanála being the body, a separate body or the Office of the Ombudsman. There are a number of ways of implementing that recommendation but we certainly intend to implement the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> In respect of Deputy Broughan's point about housing, I share his belief in the need to provide housing for people. We need to do this in a number of flexible ways.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_698">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on Second Stage of the Education and Training Boards Bill 2012. The vocational education sector has, from the outset, been imbued with values that are central to good public service. They include the necessity to be responsive to current and future needs, the ability to contribute to our overall competitiveness, to provide flexibility in what is delivered and how it is delivered, and to deliver for people at local level. These attributes, combined with a capacity to offer a diverse and broad educational package, were all hallmarks of the early days of vocational education. They remain so today.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> From the time of its formal inception in Ireland in the late 19th century, vocational education has played an increasingly important role. Since their establishment in 1930, taking over from the former technical instruction committees, vocational education committees have evolved beyond all recognition. Today VECs provide a complex network of education and training provision in a varied range of settings. The role of VECs has grown far beyond what was envisaged and legislated for in 1930.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Under the Education Act 1998, VECs are the legal patrons of second level schools that they maintain, and these vocational schools and community colleges currently educate approximately 24% of all mainstream post-primary pupils. I refer to a total population in the order of 360,000. The VECs have an important role in the community and comprehensive school sector, where they are co-patrons with religious authorities of community schools. Community and comprehensive schools together educate approximately 17% of the mainstream second level population. Taken together, they comprise a very sizeable proportion of the total number of schools, which is approximately 730.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> VECs play a central role in the provision of adult and further education programmes, including PLC courses, the Back to Education initiative, community education, the Youthreach programme and the VTOS, in addition to the adult education guidance initiative and child care measures. The VEC sector has been an important contributor historically in respect of Government labour market interventions, originally to tackle high levels of youth unemployment in the 1980s and more recently in the provision of additional places under the PLC and Back to Education programmes as part of labour-market activation strategies. Other measures supported by the VECs are designed to promote social inclusion. These include adult literacy courses and the senior Traveller training centres. The VECs also distribute funding to schools in their area that participate in the DEIS disadvantaged schools programme, and they support education provision in prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Let me turn to the reasons for reform. When in 1930 the then Minister for Education, Professor John Marcus O'Sullivan, spoke during the Second Stage debate on the Vocational Education Bill in this House, he set out the case for new legislation. He pointed to the evolution of new issues that could not have been foreseen when the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction Act (Ireland) 1899 was enacted. He stated the existing provisions had not kept up with the times and highlighted the lack of proper provision in some areas. He said, "The system under which we are working at present stretches back, as far as its legislative foundations are concerned, practically a generation". The system VECs are working under stretches back almost three generations so reform and renewal are long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The reasons for reform are not dissimilar to those that obtained in 1930. At the core of this restructuring is the need to address the current low scale and size of operations in particular VECs in order to position the sector for future development. Originally 38 VECs were established by the Vocational Education Act 1930. Following a process of rationalisation in the 1990s, which merged a number of town VECs with their county VEC, this number was reduced to 33. In July 2009, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended that the number of VECs be reduced from 33 to 22 and aligned with the functional areas of 22 local authorities, which number was also recommended by the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> In September 2009, interested parties were invited to make written submissions on a reduction in the number of VECs. Arising from this process, the previous Government decided in October 2010 to reduce the overall number of VECs from 33 to 16 and agreed on the merger of particular counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> In June of 2011, the Government confirmed a reduction to 16 but decided to revise the configuration agreed by the previous Government. It also approved, in principle, the preparation of a new Bill to replace the existing VEC legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> In October 2011, following Government approval, the general scheme of an education and training boards Bill was published and referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education. Following discussions with my Department and relevant stakeholders, the committee prepared a report in December last year and I responded to it at a meeting of that committee on 25 January 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> The Education and Training Boards Bill was one of the first Bills to go through this process, which is part of a commitment in our programme for Government. This approach has facilitated earlier scrutiny of the detail of the Government's proposals by the Oireachtas in addition to engagement with a variety of stakeholders. This engagement has helped to shape the Bill and provided an important opportunity to reflect on how best we should approach reform of the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"><b>
						</b>I will now outline the provisions of the Bill.<b>
						</b>Its purpose is to give effect to the outlined Government decisions. Its provisions will allow for the establishment of the newly configured bodies as education and training boards and will reform and modernise the existing governance provisions. It removes outdated terminology and articulates the functions of the boards to better reflect the existing and future role these bodies will have in the sector in regard to the provision of education and training to learners of all ages both in schools and in other settings. The role is considerably wider than the original concepts of "vocational education" and "technical education” that are set out in the 1930 legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> This new Bill will replace the nine existing vocational education Acts with one primary Act that provides for the establishment and operation of the new entities. It reflects the enhanced role of the sector which will follow the establishment of SOLAS, the new further education and training authority that will replace FÁS. That new authority will operate under my Department and will co-ordinate and fund the wide range of training and further education programmes around the country. The proposals in relation to SOLAS envisage a key role for the new education and training boards in delivering further education and training in an integrated manner. This is why the legislation is entitled the Education and Training Boards Bill. I will introduce separate legislation to place SOLAS on a statutory footing. I hope to do so later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The Bill has 64 sections divided into eight Parts and five Schedules. Section 10<b>
						</b>sets out the functions of education and training boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">They include providing for the establishment and maintenance of education and training board schools, centres for education and education or training facilities in their functional areas; establishing and maintaining such institutions at the direction of the Minister; planning, providing, co-ordinating and reviewing the provision of education and training in those bodies as well as in child detention schools, prisons and facilities maintained by other public service bodies; adopting strategy statements and annual service plans; delivering training for bodies that provide funding for this, such as SOLAS; supporting the provision, co-ordination, administration and assessment of youth work services; and assessing the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Subsection (2) makes provision for boards to consult relevant people and bodies. On Committee Stage, I intend to include business and employers' groups on the list of people to be consulted by boards in carrying out their functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The legislation maintains the distinction between functions that are reserved to the elected members of a board and the executive functions performed by the chief executive and his or her staff. Section 12 sets out which provisions of the Bill are reserved functions. These include requesting a change of name of an education and training board; appointment or suspension of the CEO; adoption of a strategy statement, annual service plan and annual report; acceptance of gifts or becoming a trustee; authorisation of members' attendance at certain events; establishment and dissolution of committees and related matters; keeping of accounts; and acquisition, development or disposal of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Sections 14 to 18, inclusive, contain provisions relating to the chief executive and staff of an education and training board. These include appointment and disciplinary matters, terms and conditions of employment, functions and powers. The provisions allow the Minister to designate a person to be appointed the first chief executive of an education and training board before the establishment day. The system of suspension, holding sworn inquiries and requiring ministerial consent to remove a vocational education committee, VEC, officer from office is to be ended. In future, disciplinary issues affecting staff will be an executive function vested in the chief executive. In the case of disciplinary proceedings against the chief executive, a new provision modelled closely on a similar one applicable to county managers has been adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> Section 19 allows the Minister of the day to direct an education and training board to establish or maintain a recognised school or centre for education or to establish, maintain or resource an education and training facility in its area. This vital new power may be necessary where there is inadequate provision for education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Section 20 facilitates education and training boards co-operating with one another in the performance of their functions and allows the Minister to direct them to perform a function jointly. It also allows the Minister to request the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, to assist boards in the joint exercise of functions that are the subject of ministerial direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> The published general scheme of the Bill permitted education and training boards to operate education facilities jointly with bodies that are not education and training boards and introduced an enabling provision allowing them to provide support services in respect of other providers. While this is not included in the published Bill, I propose to introduce the necessary amendment on Committee Stage. As we will introduce a number of amendments because of the way the Bill has been accelerated, I assure the House that I will circulate these well in advance and facilitate the Deputies opposite. They will receive the amendments in good time. If they wish to be briefed on the amendments, a briefing will be made available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Section 21 allows the Minister to direct a board to carry out a function in another board's area. This provision may be of particular value in terms of the additional training functions that the new bodies will be tasked with through SOLAS after it is established.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> Section 25 provides for the making of five-year statements of strategy by each of the 16 education and training boards. The section provides for consultation with relevant stakeholders and that considerations of policy and financial resources must be taken into account in preparing those statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Part 3 of the Bill deals with membership issues affecting the boards. Section 28 sets out the composition of the new boards. There will be ten local authority representatives, two staff representatives, two parents' representatives and four community representatives. Deputies who have served on VECs will be aware that the proposed system differs from the current position where there are nine local authority elected members - 12 in the case of County Dublin VEC - two members of each urban district within a county area of up to four urban districts or one member for each urban district where there are more than four urban districts, two parents' representatives, two staff representatives and four community representatives appointed by the local authority following consultation with the other members appointed by the VEC.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> Under the new Bill, the Minister may determine the proportion of members to be drawn from each local authority having regard to relative populations. Each national association of parents must nominate one man and one woman. Where more than one national association of parents is permitted to nominate parent representatives, the local authority members and staff representatives must pick the two parent representatives from the nominees.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> The Minister will draw up a list of bodies that can make nominations for membership. I have received a number of representations to have specific bodies included on this list. I will give consideration to these representations in drafting the list. The core board - local authority members and staff and parent representatives - will co-opt four people from the nominees of the listed bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Existing members of VECs will automatically become members of the new education and training boards and will continue on in office until the next local elections. Having given great consideration to this provision, I believed it only right and proper that sitting members of VECs who were elected to those bodies following the last local elections were entitled to serve out their term, provide a continuity of institutional memory and bed down the organisation in its new format. The provision also adheres to good practice in the transitional periods of merging organisations. Where executive boards or committees have merged, they have encompassed representatives from both organisations during the new entity's formation. This practice struck me as being the right approach. However, it will attract a certain amount of negative criticism. Where three VECs join together - at least three or four such amalgamations are envisaged - their joining will attract a great deal of adverse public commentary, as the fully merged committee will be quite large. Perhaps Members might have an opportunity on Committee Stage to articulate how this issue could be discussed. People who are not as well informed as others might make comments that could be of an adverse nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Sections 29 to 36, inclusive, deal with membership issues such as elections, appointment, eligibility, ceasing to be a member, disqualifications, casual vacancies and expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Part 4 provides for the regulation of education and training boards. This includes a power to issue legally binding directions on a board, the appointment of a person to investigate the performance of a board's functions, the transfer of functions to another person in limited circumstances and the removal of board members. Under the current VEC legislation, the Department's inspectorate has the power to inspect any place maintained or assisted by a VEC. It also makes it a criminal offence for a person to obstruct or impede an inspector in exercising his or her functions. When the draft heads of the Bill were published, some people viewed this provision as excessive in light of what would be required. In fact, it was embodied in earlier legislation. It simply had not been activated or utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">We are not adding a new draconian instrument of compliance or forced obedience. I will take into account on Committee Stage the concerns expressed by some of the representative organisations on this provision, particularly the question of interpreting what is an obstruction or impeding an inspector in the exercise of functions.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_729">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_730">- recognising the right of older people to live in dignity and independence, and to age well, in their own homes and communities and for as long as possible;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_731">- knowing that 91 per cent of older people rely on the State pension and related supports to protect them against risk of poverty;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_732">- understanding that home help and home care packages are vital, not only to enhancing the quality of life of older people and supporting their preferred wishes, but also to reducing pressures elsewhere in the health care system, including acute hospital services;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_733">- commending the work of home helps, home care providers and carers who care for the needs of our older people and those in infirmity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_734">- acknowledging that the demand for these services, and for additional supports such as meals-on-wheels, day and respite care, will continue and will increase as the demographics and complex needs of older people change;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_735">- accepting that the Government, despite the economic challenges, must maintain and improve, by all means possible, the social fabric of Irish society, caring for and cherishing people with disabilities, their families and others in need;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_736">- condemning the recent Government decision to cut up to €1.7 million in funding for home care packages and approximately €8 million in funding for home help hours between now and this year’s end, equating to some 450,000 hours of support for those in need, and which, further to cuts implemented in January, will see almost 1 million hours of home help hours withdrawn over these 12 months; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_737">- recognising the devastating impact these cuts will have on the quality of life and general well-being of those affected;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_738">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_739">- immediately reverse the cuts to home help hours and home care packages and to return funding to pre-Budget 2012 levels;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_740">- maintain, develop and enhance home care front-line services and to guarantee continued reliable access to community care for older people; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_741">- draft, publish and implement a national positive ageing strategy before December 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I welcome the opportunity to propose this motion on behalf of Sinn Féin. The motion calls for the immediate reversal of the proposed €8 million in cuts to home help hours and up to €1.7 million in cuts to home care packages. These cuts will have, and are already having, a devastating effect. That is no overstatement.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> For those availing of these services the importance of them cannot be exaggerated. Having a home help person in the home for a couple of hours daily to provide social interaction, practical help and real support is invaluable to the beneficiary. These people facilitate older and infirm people living an independent life with dignity and, as is their wish, in their own home. They are a fundamental corner stone of the community-based primary care approach to health care and well-being, one which this Government, at least in words if not deeds, claims to espouse.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Those deeds tell a different tale. Since a peak of 12.5 million hours in 2008 this and the previous Government have led a sustained attack on vital home help services. If the proposed cuts go ahead as planned a staggering 20% of hours will have been removed from the service over four years. Significantly, this process of cuts has accelerated under the watch of the Minister, Deputy Reilly. Since coming to office he has signed off on the removal of almost 1 million home help hours. These figures are a damning indictment of the Minister’s approach, his ideology and his management of our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> The Minister must recognise that home help personnel make an immeasurable contribution to the quality of life, health and overall well-being of recipients, the social fabric of this State and to the economic viability of our health services. He did so while in opposition. In 2011, as spokesperson on health for Fine Gael, he told reporters at the launch of the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, that home help "maintains people at home, giving them dignity and independence and also saving the taxpayer a lot of money". One can only speculate as to what has changed his mind in the mean time, as he is now apparently content to see those availing of home help services live without the same degree of dignity or independence he once lauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The current strategy seems to be one of burning the candle at both ends. It is absolutely clear that home help services, through home help hours and home care packages, save this State hundreds of thousands of inpatient and long-term care bed days. As the Minister proposes to cut services at one end in community care, services at the other end are being cut too. Acute hospital and public nursing home beds, respite services and convalescent care are all being cut. Reports earlier this year indicated that more than 93,000 bed days were lost in our acute hospitals in the first four months of 2012 because hundreds of patients were unable to leave due to delayed discharges. The system has already seized and these cutbacks will add exponentially to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the designate HSE director general, Mr. Tony O’Brien, passed off these latest home help cuts as not affecting those in receipt of service. This is a complete and astounding misrepresentation. We are seeing services for individuals cut to the bone. For example, 30 minute services have been cut to 15 minutes and weekend services have been curtailed for families in receipt of the carer's allowance. Mr. O’Brien and his colleagues in the HSE might argue that, technically, services are not being withdrawn, but those who rely on them know the true story is very different. It is absolutely clear that anyone who thinks that 15 minutes is an appropriate allocation has neither an adequate understanding of nor the slightest appreciation of the role and importance of these services. It is an insult. Similarly, the numbers of those affected by these cuts is underestimated due to the exclusion of those on waiting lists or those who would otherwise be due a home help or home care package in the next number of months. The non-allocation or delayed allocation of services is a well-used tactic to hide the full extent of these cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> We cannot avoid the backdrop to what is unfolding. Make no mistake about it, these cuts are being introduced principally as a result of the Minister’s failure to deliver on his own commitments and that of the Government. He failed to deliver the €124 million in savings on the drugs bill this year, as mooted late last year. He failed to deliver expected savings from the cost of private care in the public health system, again as mooted late last year. These two items alone would have negated the need for these heartless cutbacks affecting some of the most vulnerable in our society. The then HSE chief executive, Mr. Cathal Magee, reminded the Minister of this fact repeatedly before his resignation. Instead the Minister’s inaction led to the health budget falling far short, yet again. The more things change the more they stay the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Finally, I make special mention of those many thousands of home help workers, mainly women, who have been faced with cuts to their hours and wages and ever-increasing challenges to balance their family budget. I acknowledge the presence of a number of those very special workers in the Gallery. The crisis in the health budget does not occur in a silo. Its effects are far-reaching. Widespread reports and evidence of the privatisation of these services is consistent with the Minister’s approach. I would have thought it is not consistent with the approach of the Minister of State opposite, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The much vaunted commitment to primary care, care in the community and care in the home has long been tempered with the caveat that these services should be delivered through the private sector. I commend the resistance shown by workers and service users alike to that disgraceful trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> This Sinn Féin motion recognises the role and importance, socially, health-wise and economically, of home help services and calls for the immediate reversal of these cuts. I urge all Deputies to support the motion in clear recognition that these cuts do not make sense. Vulnerable older people will be forced from their homes into expensive institutional care and workers will be forced into greater hardship. The Minister was delighted to announce yesterday savings of some €16 million on the drugs bill before this year’s end, a fraction of that promised earlier. Nevertheless, this is twice the proposed cut to home help hours. The Minister should now give proof of his commitment to community care and care in the home and use this money to reverse these cuts immediately. I urge Deputies present to use their respective good offices to urge the reversal of these disgraceful cuts to home help hours and home care packages. I urge all Deputies, both Opposition and Government, to support this motion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_751">During the last general election I called to a door on one of those wet miserable nights. Up to that point, people were not really engaging. I came across a woman who was a carer and who was livid about the cuts in services. I met some carers about a half an hour ago who spoke about the difficulties they faced in what they were being asked to do. Many of them said they were basically being asked to work for nothing and that it was wrong. They were also being asked to make a choice in regard to patients, in many cases elderly ones, who they were looking after. The choice was whether to spend more time with them, which is the human thing to do, or to go home to their families. In many cases, the carers spent more time with the patients at the expense of their own family life.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I spoke to that woman after the general election and she said she noted in the programme for Government that the Government would maintain, if not increase, services. I spoke to her recently and she was again livid but with this Government. The change she voted for did not happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I spoke to her about a family I called to in my constituency. The man was released from hospital, he could not walk, was carried up the stairs and left there. His wife used a walking stick, was an alcoholic and could not look after herself while his son was a drug addict. That man was sent home to those conditions. I visited the house. There was no fire lighting and the man was starving.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I raised the issue with the Health Service Executive in the area and asked how this could happen in this day and age. People informed me that individuals looking for care or care in the community have no rights. That strikes me as crazy. This man was released from hospital, which cleared a bed, but was he released to be sent home to die or was he supposed to be released into an environment in which people looked after him? There are 7,500 people living in that same area but it does not have a primary care centre or a doctor. This man was released into that environment. Meals-on-wheels are not delivered to that area. Thankfully, help arrived eventually but it was a long time coming. We have money for many things but people cannot understand why do not prioritise this area. </p>
          <p eId="para_755"> We seem to be contradicting ourselves in what we are doing. A decision was made to close St. Brigid's, Crooksling, which looks after women with dementia, many of whom are high dependency, and patients in Tallaght hospital were told they could not be moved there. I am glad that decision was reversed and it will remain open. It did not make sense. The home was supposed to close because of a lack of money but more was spent keeping patients in beds in Tallaght hospital. It would cost a fraction of that amount to keep those elderly women in St. Brigid's. What we are doing does not add up. People deserve our help. We need cross-party support for the work the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is trying to do. We need to legislate and give people rights.</p>

        <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_756">I am ashamed to be a Member of a House which has to debate whether we give dignity and care to our vulnerable older citizens. Life is a cycle. As they grow older, people become more dependent on others to support and to help them. It is natural, especially for generations which lived and worked without the strong protection of legislation on health and safety or workers' rights. How many of our parents slaved in England or elsewhere in terrible conditions, with no consideration for their health from the bosses? How many worked at home for decades in such conditions, unprotected by a State which was not the Republic dreamed of by their fathers and mothers before them? Fortunately today, the needs of many of these people are cared for. They have support from a family member or a home care professional, allowing them to live in dignity, in their home and with whatever level of independence they have succeeded in maintaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> However, many who require these supports are not adequately resourced, either losing their care package, some care hours or never being considered for one due to cuts to the service. It is shocking and disturbing that we can spend a single penny of the people's money before we have ensured that our older, more vulnerable and needy citizens are supported, protected and cared for with dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> Before entering Government, the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, lauded those who marched to protect their medical cards as a universal entitlement for all people over the age of retirement. He told them of their courage and of how they had earned their place in Irish society through decades of hard work. I am not sure how such sentiments square with a cut of €1.7 million in home care packages and approximately €8 million in funding for home help. Those figures, given the huge cuts going on in Departments generally, can get a little bit lost in translation. How much is €1.7 million in home care packages and €8 million in home help? How far does that kind of money stretch when providing these services to vulnerable older people? The figure of hours cut by this Government in help and support for older people is devastating - 450,000 hours. That is 51 years of working hours to help and support our elderly population.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> What is worse is that this is just a portion of the devastation this Government is reaping on help hours. In January, 1 million hours will have been withdrawn in 12 months. I do not need to illustrate again just what that means but it will be terrible for many older people who need help.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> This Government often accuses my party of being over the top, of exaggerating and of scaremongering but how can it claim this? These cuts are not something we should just put up with. We must shout as loud as we can in opposition to them. They are callous and they are weak positions to take in that the people affected by the cuts are the old and dependent. It is an utter condemnation of this Government and this State that people who have worked all their lives and who have struggled and fought for our future are, when it was their turn to be supported, being given up on.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> A total cut of €9.7 million in funding was recently announced. Sinn Féin has repeatedly highlighted large areas for cuts and tax increases which would allow us to pay for the care of our older people and give stimulus to the economy. Growth in our economy caused by stimulus would give us the hope that in the future weak Governments, like this one, would not target so blatantly those who cannot defend themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The Government should listen to the calls of the people working in this sector, those who give everything they have to their clients and who nurture and care for them as if they were their own and for little reward and, certainly in the case of this Government, little respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The Government should also listen to the call of the families who are doing their best, as they struggle in these harsh economic times and try desperately to give comfort, support and dignity to their loved ones. It should finally listen to the older people who rely on this care and depend on this funding. The Government parties should listen to them and their pleas that they deserve dignity. The fundamental basis of the idea of human rights is that we all are deserving of the most basic human dignity. Cuts like these strip that dignity for good people who have done nothing to provoke attack. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_764">The amount being cut from home care and home help services is relatively small relative to the overall scale of the cuts being implemented but they will have a significant impact across the country. Just as strategic public spending has a positive multiplier effect in terms of the overall economy, cuts have the opposite impact beyond the initial scale of the money involved. Not only will the scaling back of the level of home help have a negative impact on the lives of the elderly who depend on this service for both practical and indeed social support, it will also further cut into the incomes of households which are under pressure and for whom the payments for their service contribute to the ability of low income families to maintain some quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> There are an estimated 800 home helps in Kerry and several hundred more in the part of Limerick which I currently represent. In the context of hours spent helping the elderly and the lost income, a relatively large number of people will be directly affected by this retrograde step. Home helps are gathering petitions ahead of protests being held in Cork on Thursday and in Dublin on Thursday week. Home helps in Kerry have collected a substantial number of signatures and I am certain that the same applies in other parts of the country. I trust too that those members of the Labour and Fine Gael parties who approve of this latest attack on the fabric of society will take the time to meet the protestors when they arrive on Kildare Street and to explain to them why it is necessary in order that they receive further pats on the head from the IMF and EU for repaying the bank debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Some of the Kerry home helps have explained how the visit from them to the old person they care for is often the only one they might have in the entire day. That is particularly the case where people are living in more isolated areas across rural Ireland. Home helps have also said that while they are only paid to be there for a certain period and to do whatever errands need to be done, many of them stay with the person they care for much longer than that, and they maintain contact with them outside of their care hours either through telephone calls or visits. They question whether that would happen if the new system proposed by the HSE is implemented and that needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Home care workers also point out that the level of care they provide will not be possible within the drastically reduced time allowed for home visits, some of which are being reduced to 20 or 30 minutes. I even know of one case where the time for a visit has been reduced to five minutes. I also know of a case of a man aged 103 living in an isolated area with his wife aged 89. They are totally dependent on home help to get their groceries in, to have some quality of life and to have contact with the outside world. The fact that these cuts will impact on them is an absolute and utter disgrace. I do not know how anybody can sit on the Government benches and say the Government has no choice. We all have a choice. The choice is to look after our elderly and people in need. There is a moral obligation on every elected representative to ensure elderly people, as Deputy Ellis said, have dignity at this time of their lives. How can anybody justify reducing a home help visit to five, ten or 15 minutes? I do not know how the Minister of State can try to justify that. Given her background, I assume she fully understands the people who need help and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I trust that some Government Members will have the moral courage to stand up for our elderly people who are being discriminated against at the behest of the banks, the ECB and the IMF. They should stand up to those people and say, "We will do the right thing, we will look after our elderly people and we will ensure they have a home help service to provide them with a little contact and security". Home help provides security for people who live in isolated areas. Government Members will find their conscience if they have one. If they vote down this motion, they do not have one.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_422">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_769">Yesterday, I met home helps in Cork. I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with many of the women to whom I spoke, as she probably knows them personally through her own contact with them in the constituency as well as her role in the Department. She knows as well as I do some of the issues and decisions facing them. One home help has been put in an awful position. She now has 15 minutes to visit the elderly lady she cares for because she has to visit another client with a certain timeframe. She can spend no more than that time with the lady. She raised the issue of mental health and it hit home with me. An elderly lady is living on her, isolated from one end of the day to the other, from one week to the next, from month to month and year to year, and the only contact she has is with her home help. That daily contact goes beyond the care she is given because she has someone to relate to and talk to, which keeps her in good mental as well as physical condition. That should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> While I acknowledge home helps are the Minister of State's responsibility, I am disappointed the senior Minister is not present to listen to the debate. He should be here because the senior Minister in the Department, as we witnessed during the primary care debacle over the past few weeks, ultimately calls the shots. It is a pity he is not here. While €1.7 million is being cut from the funding for home care packages and €8 million from home help packages, we are talking about people who are vulnerable in our society and not figures. The Minister and I share a constituency and we know many of the people who rely on home help services. She is aware of the value carers and home helps give to the most elderly and vulnerable people on the north side of Cork city. I cannot understand how she can stand over cuts of that nature. I am not being political because I am aware of her record in standing up for home helps in the past and that is why it is more puzzling that, given she has primary responsibility for this area, she can stand over cuts of this nature, despite a commitment in the programme for Government to increase services in this area. Perhaps, in her contribution, she will outline the reasons this commitment has been reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I would like to refer to the personal nature of home help. I lost my father seven weeks ago today. He had motor neurone disease and he had a home help for the final two years of his life. The compassion this individual showed to our family was priceless; I cannot put a figure on it. The person came in every day and helped us to wash my Dad and change him as he was paralysed from the neck down. These tasks were emotionally draining for us as a family.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The home help came in and did it with a smile and a sense that it was done not because it was a job but because the person cared about it. At a time when we needed every support as a family, the home help, Sinéad, was a friend to my dad. Our family could never repay the kindness shown by the home helps to my dad in his final months.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> When he was diagnosed, he had one wish, to be able to pass away peacefully at home. With his condition, the speed at which he would deteriorate and the fact he would need 24 hour care, seven days a week in his final months, we knew it would be impossible without the help and support of outside people such as the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, home helps and Marymount hospice. Only for those people supporting our family, we could not have granted our father his dying wish. That is what we are talking about when we talk about home helps. We are not talking about someone who puts on the kettle, sits down for five minutes and has a chat. We are talking about people who care for some of the most sick and vulnerable people in society. They do it with a smile and have done so for years for very little money or for nothing. They did so because they had a vocation and a passion for it. We are repaying them by cutting hours, giving them no security of income and by not honouring the contracts. It is a disgrace and I cannot get over the fact our society is leaving to fall by the wayside such a group of people with commitment, compassion and experience. We are not fighting for them. Every Deputy should fight on their behalf and there should be no opposition to the motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I cannot get over the fact my family was able to grant my dad his final wish with the help of a home help but another family, facing the same challenges we faced, may not be able to grant a father or mother the dying wish to die in peace at home. That family may not be able to get the same care, attention and love we got from our home help because €8 million is being cut from the budget. How much will be cut next year or the year after? When is it enough? We are talking about people's lives and their dignity. It should be a right to remain in one's home. Every Government party Deputy needs to take a long look at himself or herself before pressing the button tomorrow night. Voting against the motion is condemning people to death. Many of these people will die of loneliness or isolation, and it is a disgrace. Every Deputy should be fighting on behalf of the most vulnerable in our society and standing up for the home helps and carers who look after them. The Minister of State and I will be relying on some of those people eventually. It would be silly to undervalue their contribution to society and it is not fair to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">I acknowledge the Minister of State. I thank Sinn Féin for allowing me speaking time, for tabling this important Private Members' motion and for the briefing organised by Deputy Ó Caoláin. This is important because there is an agenda by the Government to introduce privatisation. In 2007, the HSE paid a private company, Home Instead, €621,000 and last year it paid the same company €6.02 million. The Government wants to privatise the care of elderly people. The only thing keeping care going is that home helps are working for nothing. Where a person is in a wheelchair, one cannot take care of personal needs in 15, 25 or 30 minutes. It takes however long it takes and these people do the work rather than looking at the clock. They do the job for however long it takes and take an amount of money that is always less than the hours allotted to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Last night in Kerry, I met a large group of home helps. I informed them that Sinn Féin was introducing an important Private Members' motion which would result in a vote. I told them Fianna Fáil, the Independents and other groups would support them and that it was up to them to contact Labour Party and Fine Gael Deputies to ask whether they were in favour of taking care of elderly people in their homes or having matters dictated by the troika and Government policy. One cannot be for two things on this issue. One is either with the older people in our community, who want the dignity and privacy of care in their homes, or one is for something else, but one cannot be in favour of two things. It drives me mad when Deputies go home pandering and kissing the backsides of people at home, promising they will do this, that and the devil. When they come here, Deputies do the exact opposite and that is not right. Deputies should be straight in their dealings and tell people they will not back them on this issue and that they are with the Government. Deputies try to say one thing at home and something else in the Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> Privatisation is the agenda. I thank the unions for the work they have done in representing home care workers. They are doing so to the best of their ability but I want them to be tough on the point that we cannot bow down and say it is acceptable if people only have 20 minutes to look after someone. Unions must fight that type of nonsense. The majority of us adore our elderly people. Why do we adore them? They were there before us, they are older than us and it is in all of us to respect our elderly people. I compliment Older and Bolder on the great work it does and the way it stands up for old people. We may not survive long enough to be old but, if we do, we would like to think that people will take care of us, respect us and do right by us. The motion asks that we do right by the elderly people in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I had the privilege of serving with the Minister of State, along with great people such as Joe Sherlock, on what was the Southern Health Board. We were passionate about the services in our communities and I know this measure does not sit well with the Minister of State. I am not being political and I know where her heart lies. I would love to see people rising up and refusing to toe the line and voting with their hearts and for what they believe in.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Being factual about it from a money point of view, we all know it is cheaper and economical to take care of people in their homes rather than putting them in private nursing homes or in long stay beds in our community hospitals. It is infinitely more expensive to take care of people in that way so our home helps provide a great service at minimal cost. They keep people where they want to be in order that neighbours and people in the community can visit them, and it keeps them out of the hospital structure. When they go to bed at night, those people are lying down in the one place everyone in the world likes to be: one's own bed. I ask the Minister of State to take on board the compassion shown by every Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> I compliment every Deputy who spoke on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">In particular, I compliment Deputy Micheál Martin on highlighting page 31 of the programme for Government which has been, effectively, shredded with the continuation of cuts.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_783">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_787">recognises the significant existing investment of, for example, in the region of €320 million this year for home help and home care packages and overall for the wide range of HSE health and personal social services generally, including mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite care, which meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people and help reduce pressures elsewhere in the wider health system;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_788">notes the complex and multi-disciplinary nature of such services, including the partnership by the HSE with non-statutory agencies to complement its overall funded provision;</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_790">acknowledges various quality related initiatives led by the HSE, including developing new guidelines and a new procurement framework for its home care services;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_791">welcomes the recent publication by this Government of the national carers’ strategy, which reinforces the Government’s recognition of, and commitment to, all those caring in whatever capacity for vulnerable people;</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_793">acknowledges that it is best practice to keep home help and other services for older people under review, so that such assistance is in keeping with their individual requirements, as assessed by the local health team, which may increase as well as diminish; </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_794">and commits to keeping the position in relation to home help and home care packages under review for the remainder of the year, and that anyone who has been assessed as needing a service will have that service provided."</p>
          <p eId="para_795">With the agreement of the House, I will share time with Deputies Michael McCarthy and Catherine Byrne.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> No one I know, no one involved in politics and no one who has direct experience of elderly people in the community underestimates the value of home helps. Everyone recognises the incredible work they do. I do not disagree with anything Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said about his father. I know the experience his family had. It was not a pleasant experience but it was made manageable by the supports the family received. A cup of tea can be as valuable in certain circumstances as intensive help would be in another. We cannot forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Home helps work across a range of services. They wash, move and turn bedridden people. They care for families and do household chores. The flexibility within the service is what makes it so valuable. In other care settings there can be a rigidity and demarcation of responsibility leading to inflexibility and, in some cases, a lack of the homely atmosphere that we can only have in our own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Fortunately, the majority of older people do not require dedicated intervention until absolutely necessary and, unlike some other care options, community based services for older people are intended as an individual and family support. That needs to be reiterated. In some cases it is not one person who is being helped within his or her own home, but an entire family. </p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I fully appreciate, through feedback from various sources, the difference quality home care can make to individuals and their families. It is estimated that there are around 100,000 people over the age of 65 who receive some form of HSE community based supports each year. The HSE Service Plan 2012 provides for various community based services such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, meals-on-wheels and day or respite care.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> It is widely acknowledged, both in Ireland and internationally, that the home help service is one of the key services in the community care of older people. It is a critical factor in helping to maintain older people in their own homes and communities. That is not in dispute. The service is discretionary and flexible and this allows it to be targeted at those most in need. The home help service primarily includes the provision of personal care and essential domestic support, mainly for older people. The level of service provided depends on the resources available. We all understand that perfectly.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The service is provided, depending on local arrangements, by HSE employed home help staff and-or through a partnership of private or voluntary sector organisations. In the last year, my experience in the Dublin area has been that several voluntary organisations provide home help and home care. They have done an exceptional job for many years and continue to do so. We need to bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> In 2011, there were just over 11 million home help hours provided to about 51,000 clients nationally. Approximately 11,000 clients were in receipt of a home care package, HCP. At the end of July 2012, some 6,072 million home help hours had been provided to clients nationally in the first seven months of this year. The number of people in receipt of home help services at the end of July was 50,139. The vast majority of clients in receipt of services at that time were older persons, with smaller numbers of people with disabilities, children and families, or those with mental health problems benefiting from the service. It is sometimes forgotten that home helps provide service across a range of disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> In addition to mainstream home help, the HSE also provides, either directly through HSE employees or indirectly through voluntary or private organisations, home care packages, HCPs. It is important to emphasise that such packages do not replace existing services. At the end of July 2012 there were 11,119 people in receipt of a home care package. A home care package is an enhanced level of services for those people living in the community that require additional home supports. The purpose of home care packages is to facilitate timely discharge of older clients from acute services; reduce inappropriate admissions of older people to acute care or residential care; reduce pressures on accident and emergency departments; support older people to continue to live, or return to live, in their own homes or communities; and support carers so that they might be able to continue to provide care for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> We are working on mechanisms to ensure that people can leave acute hospitals and return to their own homes. I was working on this issue this afternoon. I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin that helping people to leave acute beds and return to their homes, or to a step-down facility, is something we must address as a matter of urgency. We have been working on this actively.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The HSE has a statutory responsibility to live within the budget voted to it by the Oireachtas. In this context, the HSE developed a range of proposals for discussion, which would reduce spending and yield cash between now and the end of 2012, which is not an easy task. It is a priority for the HSE to minimise the impact on patients and clients of any spending reductions. Many of the proposals, therefore, focused on areas that do not have a direct patient impact, such as furniture, education and training, office expenses, ICT, travel and subsistence or similar measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> The target in the HSE service plan for 2012 was to deliver 10.7 million home help hours to 50,000 people with a budget of €200 million. In addition, just over 15,700 people were targeted to receive a home care package in 2012, at a budget of €138 million. That is all outside the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> It is proposed that there will be a reduction of approximately €8 million in spending on home help hours between now and the end of December, and €1.2 million for home care packages. However, the HSE intends that the impact of these reductions will be minimised for individual recipients by ensuring that services are provided in the first instance for direct patient cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Decisions in regard to the provision of home help hours will continue to be based on a review of individual needs and no current recipient of this service and who has an assessed need for this will be without a service. That is something we have insisted on. Similarly, the HSE is reducing the home care package budget by €1.2 million from an overall target of €138 million, and the same principles in regard to minimising client impact apply. </p>
          <p eId="para_809"> This has been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures. The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability. Notwithstanding the recently announced reductions for HSE home support provision over the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant, with expenditure of about €320 million expected for home help and home care packages this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve its approach nationally to all relevant aspects of its home care services. These include various new guidelines for home care and recently adopting a new procurement framework for approved agencies providing such services on its behalf. While ongoing developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other key aspects of planning and delivering services for both providers and care recipients alike. We are all aware of the financial circumstances in which the country finds itself, but the applications for home help and home care packages have not stopped. They are still being accepted and people are still being assessed. We are working on the assessment of need because we believe a great deal more can be done to ascertain the person's true needs, be they social or medical. We must take the social needs into account as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Following a national procurement process concluded earlier this year, approved external providers of home care packages must meet certain criteria, including requirements relating to staff training, elder abuse, infection control, recruitment of staff, supervision of staff and monitoring of care. Each provider must sign a service level agreement with the HSE and these incorporate quality, safety and monitoring requirements. The new procurement process will not impact on existing service providers and will only apply to any new home care packages to be assigned during the lifetime of the agreement. The fundamental motivation for this tender was the introduction of improved standards for enhanced home care services for clients nationwide. The tender is due for review in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> On a broader but related front, we will progress the commitment contained in the programme for Government to develop and implement national standards for home support services. These, as envisaged, will be subject to inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. Various options are currently being examined, including the complex legal issues involved. However, the strategic reality we face is a need to prioritise legislation across the wider social care area, such as that relating to widely accepted requirements in the child care and disabilities areas. As regards the latter, the Government continues to fund a broad range of services to the tune of €1.4 billion<b>
						</b>each year. In 2012, the Health Service Executive national service plan commits to providing residential places for 9,100 people, day services for 18,600 people with intellectual disability, residential support for 6,300 people and 1.64 million hours of personal assistant or home support hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> While this programme provides support for the full cohort of people with disabilities, older people in this category also benefit through respite and personal support services. A number of other significant developments are also underway to transfer more people with disabilities from congregated residential settings into the community and to put in place a system of registration and inspection of residential services by HIQA, which is expected to be up and running by the middle of next year. We hope to have the standards developed by HIQA published in January next.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> As Minister with responsibility for older people, I am keenly aware of the importance of positive ageing, not only for each of us as individuals, but also for our communities and for Irish society as whole. The Government acknowledges the need "to better recognise the position of older people in Irish society". The programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the national positive ageing strategy so older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live as full and independent lives as possible. The strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people. It will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Departments which will clearly set out each Department's objectives relating to older people. Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the strategy. However, I do not envisage that the strategy will propose new service developments. Instead, it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people. A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been completed. It is my intention that a draft of the strategy will be brought to the Government at the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Carers are vital to the achievement of Government policy for older people, children and adults with an illness or a disability, which is to support them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. I am fully aware that every day in this country tens of thousands of family members, friends, partners, parents, children, neighbours or home helps provide care for someone who, through a variety of circumstances, is in need of that care. The Government is under no illusion about the challenges carers face on a daily basis. That is why the Taoiseach committed to developing the National Carers' Strategy, which was launched in July of this year. The strategy sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The National Carers' Strategy is the first of its kind to be developed in recognition of the invaluable role and contribution of carers. It places carers firmly on the national agenda and sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers. It sets out a vision to work towards and an ambitious set of national goals and objectives to guide policy development and service delivery to ensure carers feel valued and supported to manage their caring responsibilities with confidence and are empowered to have a life of their own outside of caring.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> It is very important that available resources are targeted at those most in need and that care is provided in the community and the home as much as possible. The continuing pressure on resources in the health sector generally will make it an imperative that we obtain the best targeting of resources towards those most in need. Members can rest assured that this will entail follow through on all the commitments outlined in the programme for Government, including progressing regulation of the home care sector and considering new ways to fund home care, similar to the model pertaining for long-term residential care, or the fair deal scheme as it has become known.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> The Government will make every effort to protect front-line home support services for vulnerable older people. The position next year will be considered in the context of concluding the Estimates and budget process for 2013. I have been listening to the contributions from Deputies and will take their comments on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_425">
          <from>Deputy Michael McCarthy<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_819">Much has been said in recent weeks and months about the HSE budget. It is obvious there is a huge task in that regard, not just in respect of home care services but in a variety of areas. Let us look at the context in which this debate is framed. We are now a number of years into the EU-IMF deal. Some people might reasonably argue that they have heard enough about that, but that is the blank canvas with which we must start. It is the basis for all of our spending. The State has borrowed €11 billion so far this year, or it has spent €11 billion more than its income. One need not be a chartered accountant to know that such a situation is utterly unsustainable. As Ministers head into the pre-budget process, each of them will do their best to protect their budgets. There is huge pressure, particularly in the case of big spending Departments such as the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall that early in the last decade a cross-party report was produced by the joint committee on social affairs, as it was known then. People from all parties and none subscribed to the report. It proposed the abolition of the carer's allowance because at the time the State could afford to do that. Sadly, and regrettably, we are no longer in that position. This is a very sensitive issue and Deputy O'Brien spoke passionately and sincerely about his own experience of the home help service.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">We can all relate to that. No one on this side of the House disagrees with the genuine sentiments expressed in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> We must, however, place the person being cared for at the heart of this debate. Home helps are important and Ministers are essential in the process, but once we investigate the issue, the most significant person is the person being cared for. Based in west Cork, I know the importance of this service. It is critical to allowing a person to stay at home. All people wish to remain in their own home when they are older, and whatever assistance necessary to allow that is justifiable. There is also the added benefit of keeping people out of private nursing homes and community hospitals. When looking at budget decisions, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has ring-fenced €30 million for adults with disabilities. That is an achievement given the economic nightmare the country faces. There are times when we must consider the nuances of a story.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The national carers strategy referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and launched by the Taoiseach is an essential part of the programme for Government. This Government values the work being done and there is no question of its commitment to it. That work must be balanced with the needs of the person being cared for in order that he or she can remain at home for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> I support the Minister of State's view that maximising HSE supports in communities must be balanced against evolving service and resource pressures. I do not say that lightly because I can only assume the resource pressures are mammoth.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The continuing pressure on resources in the health sector will make it imperative that we target resources towards those most in need. The HSE has assured us the impact of the reductions will be minimised for patients. Decisions on the provision of home help hours will, as always, be based on a review of individual needs. The HSE has said no current recipient of the service who has had his or her need identified will be without a service. That is critical. Annually, 11 million home help hours are provided, with a budget of €195 million. It is a priority for the HSE to minimise the impact on patients and clients of any spending reductions. Many of the proposals, therefore, focus on areas that do not have a direct patient impact, such as furniture, education and training, office expenses, laptops, PCs and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> We must ensure, and there is a strong prioritisation of this within Government, that there is better co-ordination of services for older people in future. This is borne out by the recently published national carers strategy and the planned national positive ageing strategy. Further progress is to be made in the regulation of the home care sector and consideration of new ways to fund home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The programme for Government commits to the fair deal system of financing nursing home care, to the developing of a national Alzheimer's and other dementia strategy by 2013, and to a review of the fair deal system of financing nursing home care. The issue of older people, their care and the services they need is cross-departmental and does not specifically pertain to the Department of Health. In the most recent budget, when many commentators, in this House and outside of it said it was not possible, the Minister for Social Protection retained basic rates of social welfare for carers and pensioners and maintained the household benefits package. I hope that, in this debate, we will understand the genuine care this Government has for older people in society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_828">I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this issue to the House. It is an important one and I welcome the few minutes I have to speak on it. I was reared in a family where respect for parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles was very important and where everyone played a part. I know and understand only too well the needs of older people in my own family and in the community, and I recognise the value that has been given through the years by those in the health service and home carers. In early 2009, my family received the devastating news that my mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia. With a family of eight children, my mother had the best of care at home, with all of us giving a hand, especially my two brothers, who looked after her 24-7. The only words to describe their attention to her are unconditional love. They practically did everything for her. There were, however, many difficult times, and I remember on many occasions arguing with the Minister for Health and Children that we could not get incontinence pads or proper sheets for my mother's bed. The care she received at home from her family and friends, however, was second to none. At the end of her days, when she finally passed away, it made her passing more bearable for all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> For many older people it was not in their DNA to ask anything of the State but, sadly, many of them now need and deserve a little help to live with dignity in their last few months or years. The Minister of State spoke about numbers, the 9,300 home helps in Ireland, the 11 million hours of home help care, the 50,000 people who receive that care, and the millions being spent on home care packages from a total of €320 million. It sounds an enormous amount and we all know it would be even greater if we had it, but that is not possible at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> Some home help services are unregulated and that cannot continue. It is important to have proper standards in place. I agree with the points made by Older and Bolder on the need to reform home help services and adequately monitor standards of care. Regulation of services is vital and there is a need for inspections of home help provision, as well as registration of those engaged in home help. The system must be more patient focused and patient friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> The Government is aware of the needs of older people. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her work with older people. The HSE is carrying out a review, as we all know, and will continue to do so, and that is an important step. I also welcome the HSE approach to access and to identify those who are most dependent and require personal care services. These are the people we must ensure have access to the vital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> What is home help? It is about those older people and people with disabilities who cannot look after themselves and who need someone to help them with their daily washing, dressing, eating and, in some cases, medical needs. It is not simply about companionship, although I recognise its importance. To me home help is about much more than a cup of tea and a slice of toast. The focus of home help services is and must be about people's health care needs at home. We cannot always depend on the State to take on the responsibilities of families, and families must be there to support older people in their homes. There are many volunteer organisations that do wonderful work and many neighbours in communities who continue to support elderly people. We must support them and provide them with the companionship that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I am, of course, concerned about the planned reduction in the funding of home help services. The Department of Health, however, has stated clearly that no one will be left without a service and, where individuals are identified as in need of direct patient care, they will be looked after directly by the HSE. I welcome that. As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I support the call we made two weeks for the Minister for Health to review the proposed cuts to the home help service. We all agreed the letter calling on him to look at the service and not just at its cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> When I grew up, "The Wizard of Oz" and many other Disney programmes were on television. This evening I heard some people in the Opposition saying that Government party Members do not have a heart. I have a heart and want to make it clear to everyone. I do not think any Deputy or Minister in this Chamber does not have a heart. We were not elected because we do not care for people. We were elected because we care for them. As far as I am concerned, I am not an alien who just flew down from space this evening. I am a human being who walks the streets at weekends and deals with my constituency, listening to the trials and tribulations of everyone. I want a health service in the future of which we can all be proud. I want us to be able to care for those who want to remain at home. All aspects of the health service must be reviewed now.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There is not a person knocking on doors for the children's referendum who will not approach any of the issues being raised in the Chamber. They are willing to speak up. It is time for change and review. That does not mean everything has to be slashed and cut but certainly some of the services need to be reformed and the motion is about examining those reforms.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">As we will share time in equal proportion, perhaps the Chair would interrupt me after five minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> I thank Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin for tabling the motion. We tabled an amendment stating that we are in accord with everything stated in the motion but we also want to get on the record the issue of publishing the national positive ageing strategy. </p>
          <p eId="para_839"> Let us be clear - €8 million has been cut from home helps and services will be withdrawn. The chief executive of Health Service Executive and others have said nobody will be without a service. They will have a lesser service and home help hours will be cut. People who had three and four hours home help previously will have a reduced service. We all accept they will have a service but the service will not be adequate to deal with the complexity of issues facing those being cared for in the home. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I suggest the Minister of State return to her office, take out page 31 of the programme for Government, photocopy it, give it to the Minister for Health and ask him to read it one more time. Everything that is being done in regard to home care package cuts is against the grain of the programme for Government. It states explicitly that year on year there will be increased funding for people in home care packages, home help and other services to older people. Clearly what is happening is the exact opposite. The Government is withdrawing services on a daily basis from those who need home help support. Basic economics shows that it makes no sense to withdraw home care services and home help hours and force people into institutions, residential care or acute hospital settings. That is exactly what is happening. We know the results of a reduction in services and supports for people who want to remain in the home. </p>
          <p eId="para_841"> This is not about the troika or the difficulties the country faces, but about choices made by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, in dealing with the substantive issues that underpinned the budget presented to the House last year. Great fanfare was made of the consultant contracts but not one euro has been saved since. There was an explicit commitment in the programme for Government that the Government would reduce the numerous packages of consultants. We were told the generic price referencing would come through and that €124 million would be saved. To date, not one euro has been saved. Those are two areas I can identify, and we can go through some more. It was stated there would be a reduction in agency staff that would deal with the issue of over-runs in the budget. Clearly none of this has happened, hence the reason we are debating the issue of a cut of €8 million to home help services. What has happened is that there has been a budget over-run. The budget projections and figures of last year were built on a foundation of sand.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> A member of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Simon Harris, from the Fine Gael Party, said clearly that it is obvious last year's budget was built on sand. It unravelled very quickly. The difficulty is that in unravelling the budget, many thousands of people live in fear of receiving another letter from the Health Service Executive stating that an assessment of home help hours is taking place and, accordingly, there will be a reduction. I have yet to meet a person in recent weeks who has had a home help service increase; everybody's home help service is being decreased. Some of the private agencies say we offer 15 minutes for home helps. Is there anything most people could do in 15 minutes? We are talking about caring for people who want to remain in their home setting, yet we are offering them a 15 minute package where the home help comes in, does something in 15 minutes and heads off down the driveway. This is an attack on the basic principle of trying to care for people in the home in the lowest cost setting. All the analysis, metrics and indices the Department of Health has show clearly that this is the most cost-effective way of treating people and keeping them out of acute settings and long-term stay. This is a false policy in economics terms. I am not directing this at the Minister of State but the Minister - this is an attack on the most vulnerable who have given a life of service to the country and all we ask is that the €8 million cut in the budget be reversed and found elsewhere. I can identify three or four places immediately where that could be done. The Minister identified them last year and has yet to do anything about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I thank Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, Older and Bolder and the many voluntary organisations who, day and night, are advocating on behalf of the elderly who need home help hours and home care packages and support to remain in their homes and, more important, for Government support in reversing the nasty cuts.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Deputy John Browne<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_844">I compliment Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin on tabling the motion. It gives us an opportunity to raise some of the issues affecting older people in our communities. Today, I received a large number of letters from the Older and Bolder organisation. The first few words of each letter sums up what older people want. They state that they want to grow old at home. They outline the cuts in home care services and ask if they make human or economic sense. The cuts will result in earlier admission to nursing homes, longer stays in acute hospitals and anguish for families who need support in caring at home for relatives suffering from illness, frailty or disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> As public representatives, particularly in rural areas, we are aware of the importance of the home help service to older people. It enables people to live at home and remain in the community. This is the annual magician story from the Health Service Executive that it will cut €8 million from the home help service budget and remove 450,000 home help hours, but it will not affect the home help service. It also talks about efficiencies. Perhaps the Minister of State would ascertain from the Health Service Executive what it means by efficiency. I meet the Health Service Executive every three or four months with my Oireachtas colleagues in Wexford and it continues to tell us that home help and hospital services are good and the community service is good, yet we get hundreds of complaints monthly from older people owing to the lack of services. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> At any given time in Wexford General Hospital, up to ten people occupy beds when they would much prefer to go home. However, they cannot go home because no home help service is available. Community nurses in Wexford have told me there is no hope of getting home help between now and Christmas unless the person who has it currently passes away. That is disgraceful. Perhaps the Minister of State would explain tomorrow night the reason home help service in some areas in inadequate while in other areas it is not too bad. It appears there is an allocation of moneys on a county per county basis but some are faring much better than others. Given the Minister's cutbacks in the home help area, there will be no moneys available for home help between now and Christmas. It is not good enough for the Health Service Executive to say it will work on efficiencies and save money elsewhere, yet it does not spell out how it will do it. </p>
          <p eId="para_847"> Home help is a very important service for older people. Older people want to remain in the community and live at home. Perhaps in urban areas the next door neighbour will look in occasionally to check if an older person is well. Out in the rural heartland, however, there could be a distance of five to ten miles between where people reside. In such instances, it is important that home help is available to people. </p>
          <p eId="para_848"> We all accept there is a financial difficulty in the country. There is also a financial difficulty owing to the Minister not fighting his cause at the budget table last year, resulting in the inadequate moneys being available to the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">To start making cutbacks affecting the most vulnerable people in our society is completely unacceptable. As Deputy Catherine Byrne said, this decision should be revisited. There is no chance of the HSE carrying out an assessment of the number of people at present in receipt of home help between now and Christmas to ascertain who is entitled to it - that is not good enough. The money needs to be restored as quickly as possible to provide adequate home help to the people who need it. I support the Sinn Féin motion and hope some common sense will prevail within the HSE and with the Minister, Deputy Reilly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2012-10-16T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_850">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for tabling the motion and I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the debate. In any discussion on home help the constant line we get back from the public is that the home help service is value for money. The home help service saves the State by allowing people to stay in their own communities for longer. Of all the schemes the State has introduced, this one probably represents the best value for money. In recent weeks we have been inundated with calls and letters regarding people who have suffered. I received a letter this morning in respect of an elderly woman living at home who is without the use of both her legs, is wheelchair bound and has the use of only one arm. I will read one paragraph into the record of the House:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_851">A few weeks ago the H.S.E. in its wisdom ... decided to cut those few hours a week so now we have a situation where the home help are supposed to get [the person's relative] up out of her bed, dress her, look after her toilet needs, get breakfast, prepare her lunch, look after the fire and heating needs for the day, from 11.45 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. with an extra 15 minutes [on] Tuesday and Friday to facilitate a shower. Now how in the name of God can you or the H.S.E. explain to me or any other person [how] it is possible to get a totally invalided person up out of the bed, undress her, get into the shower, wash, dry and dress her again, do her hair and leave her in any sort of comfort for the rest of the day. If you or the H.S.E. can do that then I think you should enter that home help person into the Guinness Book Of Records.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Various Deputies have spoken about what can be done. Everybody understands the need for tightening of budgets, etc. The previous speaker spoke about having heart. People accept that the home help service is providing great value for money. If we all start from the point that the home help service is providing excellent value for money and keeping people in their homes for longer giving them a sense of dignity, we should ring-fence the home help budget at the start of the year and not budge from it. It should not be attacked in any shape or form because it is the best value the HSE will get in this year. It should be ring-fenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Elderly people are concerned at newspaper reports about home help hours. They constantly worry whether this might be the last month, or the last Christmas in their own home because they might no longer have the service to keep them at home. The Government and the people making the decisions must accept that as a given. Throughout the Western world every other avenue has been tried in dealing with elderly people, but this is a system that is working. Whenever there is a need for cutbacks in the HSE the first to be affected are home help hours. Across the board they have been taking away a quarter of an hour here or half an hour there. Some 99% of people will say that those on the front line providing home help services are excellent people, who take the job very seriously and take great pride in the ability to keep an elderly person in his or her own home. Whatever about other aspects of the health budget, the home help service must be sacrosanct and must be protected at all costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_855">An issue that crops up repeatedly is whether cutting home help services would save money. Every time a person ends up in an acute hospital instead of at home, it costs multiples of what the home help service would cost. We are getting approximately 11 million hours for slightly more than €200 million. In no other section of the budget is it possible to point to that kind of value for money. The philosophy behind this seems to be changing and I am concerned that we are moving towards a privatised system for many people. Let us consider the taxation benefit. A person on the 20% tax rate spending €100 per week looking after an elderly person at home may claim back €833. However, a person on the 41% tax rate may claim back almost double that - €1,453. Yet, somebody outside the tax net struggling to pay will get nothing back. That exposes something that is very wrong about the priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> Government subsidies are paid to private companies including, for example, Comfort Keepers Home Care. In 2007 and 2008, approximately €1 million was paid. That amount was €3.75 million in 2011, which indicates a change in the way we are handling this system and this budget. We used to get extraordinarily good value. Last week I had an opportunity to speak on this in another forum. I referred to an elderly gentleman who had fallen and the home help person found him behind the door two days later. He is still in hospital and one must question the sense in this.</p>

I sat on a social welfare committee with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and Deputy Catherine Byrne during the previous Dáil. I know that they were genuine, honest and caring. The Minister of State in particular is poacher turned gamekeeper. It is an appalling vista.</p>

          <p eId="para_887">No, I was interrupted. The heat is too much for the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch. The former Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, at least had the courage of her convictions and pulled out.
